Despite the horrors inflicted on us all by the masters of the universe in the global financial crisis, it still appears to be business as usual for one sector of the UK economy. The sector that, incidentally, has also helped to serve the lifestyles of a kleptocracy that now threatens to inflict the greatest conflict on Europe since the second world war. gorbon143, via FT.com Given the painful fall in living standards about to hit the majority of the population, surely this would be a very good time to stay diplomatically quiet about a bumper bankers' bonus season? Medium Rare Earth, via FT.com Divesting fossil fuel stocks? That's so last year Money managers will leap on any bandwagon to attract investor capital and generate fees which are paid regardless of how investments perform. When ESG is exhausted, they'll move on to something else. DinToronto, via FT.com One of the reasons why green stocks will tank is that they support companies pursuing technology that may not work. There is a lot of misinformation out there about the potential of solar, wind, hydrogen, and batteries to transform our electricity generation. They really are not very promising. Nuclear power, on the other hand is proven zero emission technology and yet is considered a bad investment. It is the only way to get to net zero at a global level. Anton van der Merwe, via FT.com What on earth pension trustees think they are doing in throwing money into ESG when their job is to make as much money as reasonably possible, is beyond me. I think Shell has been one of my best performers recently. Jon Fieldsend, via FT.com Scrap mounting energy standing charges There will come a time when the standing charge will be necessary. It's basically a connection charge to pay for the delivery infrastructure. A recent FT article talked of people in the US going off grid by using solar panels and wind turbines, but still wanting grid connectivity for when there is no wind or sunlight and when their local battery storage runs down. Someone has to pay for this. ex scientist, via FT.com I increasingly doubt the value of privatising assets that appear to be natural monopolies.

0b4ce70ddf4f79e15ab8,2022-02-24,Short selling has as much carbon impact as divesting,"Letters The piece ""Short selling does not count as a carbon offset"" (Opinion, February 18) contains a number of questionable claims. It is certainly true that shorting a high carbon company does not reduce the tonnes of CO2 released into the atmosphere. But it is equally true that, being long, the same company does not increase the carbon emissions. Simply, the exchange of shares among participants makes no difference to CO2 emissions in the real world. Fortunately though, there is still a way for investors to create societal impact in combination with what they can obtain through voting and engagement. At CFM, we reject the efficient market hypothesis and instead believe in an inelastic market hypothesis for which there is growing evidence. This model envisages that buying and selling decisions do alter the price of securities and hence the cost of capital of companies' underlying activities. Crucially, since the price impact of a sale only depends on its size, not whether it reduces a long position or establishes a short, shorting has as much impact as divesting. Another significant issue caused by the omission of shorts in accounting for carbon footprint is that it creates an inconsistency. The responsibility for a company's carbon footprint should go hand in hand with the degree of exposure to the financial benefits it provides. We would therefore not use legal ownership since, in too many cases, the legal owner has hedged out, or otherwise reduced their exposure to financial outcomes such as price variation and dividends. We rather advocate using the ""economically equivalent"" number of shares an investor is exposed to. Mechanically the sum of all long and short economic exposures held by market participants through outright ownership, shorts and derivative positions is always equal to the market cap. So, if you attribute to each investor a footprint equal to their economic exposure positive or negative, long or short and multiply this by the footprint per share, your metric is consistent. If you, however, omit short positions, the result is an aggregated footprint larger than that of the company, which makes no sense. In conclusion, accounting for shorts' negative footprint appears both legitimate and useful in ensuring a fair footprint allocation.

92620ee8c2bd94174f5a,2022-02-23,AllianzGI to vote against pay deals with no ESG links,"Asset management Allianz Global Investors has said it will wield its shareholder vote against big UK and European companies that fail to link executive pay to environmental, social and governance metrics from next year. Executive pay has become a flashpoint between investee companies and asset managers in recent years as they tighten scrutiny of high payouts. AllianzGI, which has €673bn in assets under management, opposed only 21 per cent of management proposals globally in 2021, but voted against 47 per cent of those related to remuneration down from 49 per cent in 2020. ""As an active investor, exercising our voting rights is one of the most powerful tools we have to effect change,"" said Matt Christensen, the German fund manager's global head of sustainable and impact investing. ""In keeping with our desire to shape a more sustainable future with measurable ... outcomes, we want to ensure our investee companies align their executive remuneration policies with ESG key performance indicators and we will vote against those that don't."" The manager voted against 4 per cent of overall proposals in the UK in 2021 but opposed 20 per cent of UK pay plans. ""The UK continues to lead the way in corporate governance standards, with our analysis demonstrating the UK has strong leadership,"" said Virginie Maisonneuve, AllianzGI's global chief information officer for equity. Almost 60 per cent of UK FTSE 100 companies link ESG benchmarks to executive pay, according to PwC, a development that was backed by twothirds of investors they surveyed. AllianzGI is not alone in scrutinising the link between pay and sustainability ambitions. Cevian Capital, the activist group, said last year it would vote against companies that failed to include targets in pay packages. In November, Institutional Shareholder Services, the advisory group, released a consultation on its voting guidelines for Europe and the UK that proposed evaluating non-financial ESG metrics in pay plans in a similar way to financial ones. PwC called the move ""a powerful signal that investors will seek to hold companies to a high bar for ESG metrics"". Last week, Liontrust, the UK boutique fund manager, faced a substantial investor rebellion over pay packages for top executives even though its proposals included ESG benchmarks. AllianzGI also amended its proxy voting rules last year to scrutinise notable changes in executive pay on a case-bycase basis ""whenever companies which received substantial direct state aid recorded substantial lay-offs or cut dividends (not prescribed by regulators) as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic"". 'Exercising our voting rights is one of the most powerful tools we have to effect change'"

7d1cf194041868f6041a,2022-02-22,McDonald's: pigs in blankets,"Twitter: @FTLex From investment activist to simply social activist? Carl Icahn, the Wall Street billionaire, will put forward two nominees seeking election to the McDonald's board. The former raider typically has a financial play in mind when agitating at a company he thinks is wayward. At McDonald's, he merely wants the fastfood group to guarantee better treatment of pigs that it incorporates into Egg McMuffins and other meals. Intriguingly, McDonald's says Icahn holds 200 shares, which are worth roughly $50,000. That small outlay emphasises the outlier status of Icahn's latest campaign. Still, US groups and their boards must be prepared for unusual attacks. Even hard-edged activists are pursuing ESG strategies, seeking to put pressure on companies over squishy matters where blunt profit maximisation is not the issue. In 2021, a start-up fund, Engine No. 1, successfully placed three directors on the board of ExxonMobil despite owning only 0.02 per cent of the company. The fund claimed Exxon had failed to keep up with the imperatives of fighting climate change. It was persuasive enough to get much larger Exxon shareholders to back it. ESG campaigns are now initiated by the likes of Third Point, not just obscure social impact funds, according to a report from investment bank Lazard. At McDonald's, Icahn is aligned with the Humane Society of the United States, which had filed a non-binding shareholder proposal demanding changes to how pregnant pigs are kept. According to the NGO, it has been discussing the subject with McDonald's and Icahn for a decade. It says the fast-food chain pledged in 2012 to end the use of ""gestational stalls"", in which sows are housed during their pregnancy. Critics claim these are injurious to the animals. Groups such as the Humane Society have typically been behind such ethically-motivated shareholder proposals. The SEC has recently tightened the rules to make this harder for small shareholders. Pairing a social justice organisation with a noisy investor is a new wrinkle. McDonald's, for its part, said that it would review Icahn's director nominees, adding that its policies on animal treatment were ""industryleading"". What applies here, as in any financially driven activist engagement, is that investors with big shareholdings will decide who is correct."
d0fec8bddf1921c11b66,2022-02-21,Oil majors prepare for bumper $38bn in stock buybacks as energy prices soar,"Western energy majors are on course to buy back shares at near record levels this year as soaring oil and gas prices enable them to deliver bumper profits and boost returns for investors. The seven supermajors including BP, Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron are poised to return $38bn to shareholders through buyback programmes according to data from Bernstein Research. Investment bank RBC Capital Markets puts the total figure at $41bn. That would be almost double the $21bn in buybacks completed in 2014 when oil last traded above $100 a barrel and the biggest total since 2008. The plans underscore the strength of companies that are reaping the rewards of a resurgence in energy demand as lockdown restrictions are rolled back. Gas prices are at record levels and oil is trading at a seven-year high of $93 a barrel, resulting in big profits for the supermajor group which also includes TotalEnergies, Eni and Equinor. Banks, including Goldman Sachs, expect Brent crude to trade at more than $100 later this year, with some predicting that if Russia invades Ukraine it will trigger an even sharper rise in energy costs. Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets said: ""The sector is in the best shape it's been in for a long time. Now the question is the duration of the cycle."" The underperformance of the companies' shares during the pandemic meant that management teams felt their shares were undervalued and that buybacks were cheap, he added. Shell is set to lead the pack, buying back more than $12bn of shares, according to RBC and Bernstein. Chevron bought back shares worth $1.4bn in 2021 and will spend $3bn to $5bn on buybacks this year. Pressure to cut emissions and the uncertainty over future demand has meant that oil and gas companies are also investing less in replacing supply than in the past, leaving management teams with even more cash. But some critics have suggested buybacks are diverting capital away from the transition to renewable energy. Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal and General Investment Management, said companies had to ""strike a balance"" given the uncertainties surrounding future energy demand. BP's 2021 results were its best in eight years and Chevron and Exxon reported their highest profits since 2014. Bonuses tied to ESG targets page 6"
1f4a3a138eba034170a7,2022-02-21,Green funds risk a red flag,"Investors have poured money into ethical and ESG-themed funds, but research has shown that the sector is rife with greenwashing. Lawyers are warning of a new mis-selling scandal in the making. By Laurence Fletcher and Joshua Oliver W hen Lucy Carraz moved her investment account to online wealth platform Nutmeg in November, she wanted her money to be in the most environmentally-friendly companies possible. But after selecting the platform's ESG investment option, which prioritises companies and bond issuers with high environmental, social and governance standards, she was shocked to discover that, rather than the wind and solar companies she had been expecting, her new portfolio's biggest holdings were bank stocks. ""I thought they [Nutmeg] would be looking to invest in specific companies or funds that are part of the solution"" to climate change, said the London-based business development director, ""rather than just [companies] having an ESG policy."" Her relationship with Nutmeg was ""very short ... once I saw where the money was actually invested"". Carraz's experience reflects a growing realisation among retail and other, larger investors in the UK, the US and across Europe that some of the vast sums of money they have poured into green and ethically-labelled investment products in recent years may not have been invested in quite the way they had imagined. A series of high-profile scandals, most notably regulatory probes into fund firm DWS over whether it misled clients about its sustainable investing efforts, has now raised fears that some of the bolder green claims made by asset managers could amount to mis-selling. Some industry insiders believe they are on the brink of a mis-selling scandal in the mould of payment protection insurance, mortgages or diesel cars. ""It's a bit like history repeating itself,"" says Fiona Huntriss, a partner at law firm Pallas Partners, who focuses on financial litigation and has worked on previous mis-selling cases. ""Words are being used in a very vague way"" by fund companies, she adds. ""Inconsistency, omissions, lack of clarity that's prime territory for mis-selling claims."" Carraz does not think Nutmeg misled her, but she does believe the process for setting up new investors should have been more clear. Nutmeg said ""we have always challenged the often confusing language used by the investment industry, alongside the lack of clarity that oversimplified labels like green or ethical and a lack of true data points brought to investment products labelled as 'sustainable' or 'responsible'."" Launching ESG-themed products has been a much-needed area of growth in recent years for asset managers, many of whom are under pressure from lowcost index trackers. Branding funds as green or ethical allow them to tap into a huge wave of investor demand and better justify the fees they charge for selecting stocks. Investors globally poured $142.5bn into sustainable funds in the fourth quarter of last year, 12 per cent up on the previous quarter, according to financial data provider Morningstar. That took total worldwide sustainable assets to $2.7tn across more than 5,900 funds, three-quarters of which were in Europe. Much of the asset flow has come from retail investors wanting to be socially responsible, who have usually made these investments in their pensions or savings accounts based at least in part on the claims made in a fund's    documentation or adverts. In the UK last year, one out of every three pounds in net sales of retail funds went to ""responsible"" products, according to data from the Investment Association. With a huge array of different, and often contradictory, ESG metrics on offer in different markets and regulators still feeling their way in this new area, fund firms have often relied on a mixture of third-party ratings and their own research. To promote the funds, seemingly vague words such as ""sustainable"" and ""green"" have been widely used. But a number of scandals have rocked the industry, sharply increasing the scrutiny on such claims. Last year, US law enforcement authorities and German regulator BaFin began investigating DWS after the firm's former head of ESG, Desiree Fixler, alleged it had misled clients about how much of its assets were invested along sustainable lines. And an FT investigation published in July found that some fund firms with strong rhetoric about tackling human rights issues were also lending money to regimes carrying out abuses. Such incidents have raised fears among fund firms of greater legal scrutiny of the claims they have made. Executives at one of London's biggest fund firms are now ""petrified"" about how it had been selling ESG funds and the wording it had been using, one senior employee said. Tariq Fancy, former global chief investment officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock, made headlines last year when he said ESG investing too often boils down to little more than ""marketing hype"" and ""disingenuous promises."" Fancy, who now runs an education technology non-profit, told the FT, ""I do think there will be more scandals to appear, and it's going to come to light soon."" What it means to be green Terms widely used in labelling and marketing ESG funds may carry more legal weight than many firms may have initially thought, some lawyers argue. Luke Fletcher, a partner at Londonbased law firm Bates Wells who has been looking into funds' sustainability claims, says that the 2015 Paris climate accord will be the legal standard against which words used to promote ESG funds will be judged. Under the legally-binding treaty, 193 parties agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C, compared with pre-industrial levels. At November's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, signatories committed to new greenhouse gas emissions targets by the end of this year, to meet the Paris goals. While the Paris accord is technically binding on nations rather than individual companies, there are already signs that it is being interpreted by judges as the standard that companies must adhere to. In a landmark ruling in May last year, a court in The Hague referred to the Paris agreement when ruling that Shell had to make greater cuts to its emissions targets than it had planned. Fletcher argues that the word ""sustainable"" defined in the Cambridge dictionary as ""causing, or made in a way that causes, little or no damage to the environment and therefore able to continue for a long time"" should be considered ""a seriously high bar"". Legally, he adds, ""if you're not aligned with the Paris goals, you probably can't say you're sustainable, in any true sense of the word."" If borne out, this would have farreaching implications for an industry that has freely used such terms. In August, a report by climate thinktank InfluenceMap found that 421 out of 593 ESG equity funds it assessed had portfolios that were not aligned with the Paris climate targets. The research, which used widely accepted Pacta (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment) methodology to measure alignment, further found that 72 out of 130 climate-themed funds were not in line with the Paris goals. That included three out of four funds marketed as ""Paris-aligned"". The report found climate funds frequently held investments in oil companies and pipeline operators. The asset management division of French investment bank BNP Paribas, which calls itself ""the sustainable investor for a changing world"", owned Chevron bonds in its Sustainable Global Corporate Bond and Sustainable US Multi- Factor Corporate Bond funds as of last summer, according to fund documents. BNP said it was committed to ""use our influence and investments to push towards a more sustainable future"". It said it filed a motion in 2020 for Chevron to disclose how aligned its lobbying was with the Paris agreement, and said neither of the two funds mentioned still own Chevron bonds. Chevron said that ""as the world transitions to a    lower carbon future ... diverse solutions including oil, products and gas will also be needed"", along with ""welldesigned government policies"". Morningstar recently cut more than 1,200 funds with assets of $1.4tn from its sustainable investment list after an ""extensive review"" of legal documents. ""If you label something [that invests in fossil fuels] sustainable, and there's a whole body of scientific opinion that new oil and gas or coal production is out of whack with climate [sustainability], then there's probably quite a good chance that you could label it as unsustainable and therefore the fund is being mis-sold in some way,"" said Dylan Tanner, executive director at InfluenceMap. While the ESG funds sector has grown rapidly in recent years, financial regulators have typically been slower to come up with ways to police the sector. That has created a ""limbo period where consumers are at risk of buying products that say they're doing something they're not doing"", according to Catherine Howarth, chief executive of responsible investment charity Share- Action, who believes mis-selling has been going on. Setting the rules But there are growing signs that regulators are taking a tougher line, with a raft of rules hitting the sector. Such rules could also give investors clearer benchmarks to assess funds' claims. In the EU, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, which is based on achieving the Paris goals, introduces new disclosure requirements for funds, which are placed into categories depending on how much they focus on sustainability. The European Securities and Markets Authority said in February it was seeking a definition of greenwash- ing that could be used by lawmakers. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority recently closed a consultation on sustainability disclosures for asset managers. The Competition and Markets Authority has also issued its Green Claims Code, which lays out in detail principles for how businesses should make claims about ESG. While not specifically aimed at fund firms, some commentators believe it could soon start being applied in the sector. The Advertising Standards Agency has said that adverts around ESG ""will require greater regulatory scrutiny in future"". In the US the SEC has formed a task force focused on ESG, including examining funds' disclosure and compliance. ""It is no secret that it [misrepresentation of ESG activities] is on the top of regulators' agendas to send a strong message and make an example,"" said Petra Dismorr, chief executive of ESG consultancy NorthPeak Advisory, which works with fund firms. The new rules are already highlighting potential issues. Sebastiaan Greeven, manager in ESG and sustainability at consultancy MJ Hudson, said he had seen funds categorised under the EU's regulations as aiming for sustainable investment ""where I doubt all the investments in these products can be considered sustainable"". He gives the example of a fund holding a stock with lower carbon intensity than its peers and questions whether that classifies as sustainable, or just better than the average company. However, some believe that regulators may not be acting fast enough. ""It seems as if there is widespread mis-selling of 'sustainable' products in the market, which would, if confirmed in court, be a serious regulatory failure,"" said Bates Wells's Fletcher. The gap between some funds' claims and the reality of their investments has left some insiders talking about whether litigation on mis-selling in Europe or the US is now also likely. A recent court case in Italy has put some in the industry on alert. In November an Umbrian court upheld a request by Alcântara, a maker of microfibre material used in car interiors, against rival Miko ordering it to stop making ""vague, false and non-verifiable green claims"". Building a case Some think that similar legal action against fund firms is only a matter of time. Robert Allen, partner at Londonbased law firm Simmons & Simmons, points to legal cases brought by shareholders against companies on ESG grounds. ""You can definitely see how it [a case against fund managers] can follow on,"" he said.    ""If the shareholders have lost money and they've felt the company has misled them, you'll see plaintiffs step in,"" said Perrie Weiner, a partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie in Los Angeles. ""You're hearing the rumblings. It's not happened that much yet, [but] it will."" Companies that fund legal action also spy a potential opportunity. ""It certainly is coming,"" said Garrett Holmes, general counsel at investment firm North Wall Capital, which provides litigation financing. ""Some unanswered questions need to be progressed for it to become the next dieselgate scandal though,"" he said, referring to carmakers who manipulated engines to fraudulently pass emissions tests. One such question is around the concept of ""loss"". In theory, an investor who had put money into an ESG fund that invested in ""dirty"" stocks could end up making more money than they might have in a fund that invested only in sustainable companies. But they might argue that they had still suffered a loss, based on the damage the investment caused to the environment. Whether any court would accept that is unclear. However, in a 2019 ruling, the Financial Ombudsman Service upheld a retail investor's complaint that their financial adviser had not followed their wishes to invest in ethical stocks. The investor was awarded a small sum, even though she had not lost out financially. Whether such litigation based on a loss to the environment can be brought is ""an area that has not been explored"", said Martina Colombo, senior associate at MJ Hudson, ""but it might now be."" $2.7tn Total invested in over 5,900 sustainable funds worldwide 1,200 Funds recently cut from Morningstar's sustainable investment list Words are being used in a vague way.

5dff5753b4bfa9d1510d,2022-02-21,Shareholders wary as more bonuses tied to ESG targets,"Kevin Johnson, Starbucks's chief executive, earned a slice of his 2021 bonus by slashing plastic straws and methane emissions an example of a trend by US companies to add environmental and social targets to bonus packages. Starbucks joined Apple and Disney in adding new environmental and workplace targets to 2021 pay, according to an analysis by Sentieo, a data provider. Shareholders will get to vote on these provisions next month when the companies hold annual meetings. Pay tied to corporate social responsibility has jumped above 20 per cent at Russell 3000 companies, up from 7 per cent in 2018, according to Institutional Shareholder ServicesESG, the proxy adviser's responsible investment arm. Pay provisions tied to workplace diversity hit 11 per cent in 2021, from 2.5 per cent in 2018, the proxy adviser said. As bonuses tied to environmental, social and governance issues rise, shareholders are sceptical. Investors are frustrated with big bonuses awarded with little accountability. A record number of S&P 500 groups failed to win investor support for bonuses in 2021. ESG pay provisions tend to be vague, and asset managers expressed concerns that if ESG pay replaced bonus targets tied to share price performance, then executives could be insulating bonuses during a turbulent stock market this year. ""There is definitely a concern that you look at [stock] market valuation and you look at pay packages and they can anticipate where we are in the cycle,"" said John Hoeppner, head of US stewardship at Legal & General Investment Management America. Apple in 2021 incorporated an ESG provision to executives' annual cash bonuses that can increase pay by 10 per cent based on ""Apple values and other key community initiatives"", according to ISS. But because executives at the company hit bonus targets for sales and income, the ESG element was not added to the bonus, the company said. ISS recommended Apple shareholders vote against pay for chief executive Tim Cook and other executives at the tech group this month. Disney incorporated diversity and inclusion targets in the company's 2021 bonus plan. Apple declined to comment beyond its regulatory filings. Starbucks and Disney did not respond to requests for comment. See Big Read"

01aba521e27e261b41eb,2022-02-19,Merryn Somerset Webb Investing,"Divesting fossil fuel stocks? That's so last year G ood news. You can now get 1.3 per cent on a Green Savings Bond at National Savings & Investments. Eagle-eyed readers will note that this is 4.2 percentage points less than the rate of inflation in the UK, as the latest CPI numbers came in at 5.5 per cent. That's true and something of a problem but nonetheless 1.3 per cent is better than the 0.65 per cent NS&I offered at the launch of the bonds a few months ago. NS&I says this is based on the rise in base rates since October when it first launched the bond. Bank of England rates up, NS&I rates up. But if that were all it was, it would make sense for the new rate to be 1.05 per cent as the Bank of England has put rates up by 0.4 percentage points. Perhaps then, the sharp rise is less to do with base rates than the lack of interest in the initial launch. NS&I reckoned that the very word ""green"" would people get in, that they'd be happy to limit their returns just to know that their money was somehow doing good. It seems NS&I may have been wrong. That's important, as it gives us a small clue as to what might happen next in the investing world. Over the past few years a wall of money hit anything with the words ESG, sustainable, ethical or green in its name. By the middle of last year, 90 per cent of equity fund inflows in the UK went into ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds according to fund transactions group Calastone, which refers to it as the ESG ""gold rush"". That's partly because people feel they'd like the world to be a better place and see this as a way to make that happen. But it is also because they have been told that investing in funds branded with one version of do-goodery or the other will outperform: saving the world one Isa contribution at a time will not just be painless, but profitable too. Virtue has its own reward. There is a problem with this story. First, it doesn't have a very long record: there has only been a critical mass of ESG investments to analyse for a decade and most of the money has come in since 2015. Second, it coincided with a low interest rate-driven boom in the kinds of growth stocks that fit neatly into an ESG story think renewable energy, tech stocks and, well, anything that doesn't make much money yet. Low rates make future profits worth more in industry valuation models. It has also been one of the drivers of its own story: the more money comes into ESG, the more money goes into ESG-friendly stocks, the more momentum those stocks get and the better the strategy looks. Until it doesn't. Welcome to 2022. The 10 biggest actively managed ESG funds tracked by Morningstar fell on average by 9.2 per cent in January, while the MSCI World index fell a mere 5.3 per cent. The shares that were never supposed to do well again are soaring. BP is up 31 per cent in the past six months, Shell (which has just reported its highest quarterly profits since 2014) by 37 per cent and Glencore by 30 per cent.    The UK market itself is even outperforming something that, given its bias to grubby miners and oil stocks, really was not supposed to happen. At the same time the stocks that ESG-branded funds keep their outperformance rolling along are tanking. The iShares Clean Energy ETF is off 11 per cent so far this year, for example. Growth stocks as a whole are suffering. Ned Davis Research notes that 76 per cent of large-cap growth stocks are now ""trading at least 20 per cent below their 252-day highs, compared to only 14.2 per cent of large value stocks"". Maybe the reason ESG funds did well wasn't because of their ESG focus but because interest rates and oil prices were very low. And maybe they aren't doing so well now because both are rising. Whoops. Makes you want to be a bit dirtier doesn't it? You aren't alone. January 2022 was the first month of negative net inflows into ESG funds on the Hargreaves Lansdown platform since March 2020. The yearon-year shift from January 2021 was especially sharp. January 2021 was a record-breaking month so we must not jump to conclusions, but still it's interesting to see how fast losing money makes people less interested in sustainable labels. This is a problem for the fund management industry. After all that virtue signalling, how do they row back so they can own the stuff that is going up too? Easy. The ESG arena is jammed with greenwashing, vague promises of purpose and mission creep already. But it is perfectly possible to make the definitions more flexible, as so often in finance. Aviva is on top of this. Its chief executive Mark Versey is mad for ESG and keen for all investors to be ""active stewards of capital"". Aviva Investors has written to 36 finance ministers asking them to adopt global climate disclosure standards. And if you go to their website the first headline is ""From climate change to climate transition"". The next two cover the same subject. However, Versey has also recently noted that a large number of green assets are ""frankly overpriced"" and one might be better ""buying brown and helping it to become green"". Divestment? That's over. Holding Glencore but nagging them about their very profitable thermal coal business, talking mostly about the nickel and copper they produce for battery manufacture and making sure everyone knows you are attending ESG week at the Energy and Mining Forum? It's the new sustainable. This shift isn't necessarily bad starving the companies that produce the metals and fossil fuels that sustain our economies and our living standards was always silly. But you should understand what's happening. As ever, your money might not be going where you think it is. Finally, a note on the NS&I green bond. Buy it and you will sacrifice hard cash for good feelings. It is fixed for three years. At the end of those three years anyone putting in £5,000 will have £198 in interest, notes AJ Bell. If you went for the best paying three-year account on the market at the moment you'd get £87 more. Something to think about. Merryn Somerset Webb is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek.

2c986f06b57985afbd60,2022-02-18,Short selling does not count as a carbon offset,"ould short selling by hedge funds of carbon polluters help save the planet? C Despite being likened by critics every now and then to greedy nihilists responsible for multiple episodes of market volatility, short sellers who bet on falling prices can play a role in moving the world towards net zero carbon emissions. But one suggestion being made by some in the hedge fund world should be treated with scepticism. The argument that has been made is that investors should be able to net out their long holdings in higher carbonemitting companies with short positions in such businesses to reduce the estimate of the overall carbon footprint of their portfolios. While there is some merit to this view, it risks conflating two very different approaches to assessing climate change in portfolios: known in jargon as ""financial materiality"" and ""double materiality"". With the former, portfolio managers are focused purely on the financial impact of climate change on a company, which allows them to evaluate the effects it will have on the risk and performance of their investments. This could be insurance or manufacturing losses stemming from an increase in extreme weather events, or a negative financial impact coming from climate regulation. In this context, expressing portfolio exposure to climate change in terms of net long and short exposure is both viable and useful: it shows how economically exposed they are to carbon risk. In double materiality, fund managers try to understand the risk that their investments pose to the environment as well as to corporate profitability. For instance, investors could look at the negative impact that greenhouse emissions from the fossil fuel industry have on climate and society to understand potential future regulatory risk. This is an idea that is gathering momentum with regulators and investors. In the EU, legislation was introduced last year to make financial groups and investors disclose double materiality. The EU Taxonomy Regulation, which some investors will begin reporting on from 2023, looks at the environmental sustainability of economic activities and whether they do no significant harm to other sustainable objectives. The UK, for example, is making explicit moves to incorporate double materiality under the Financial Conduct Authority's proposed Sustainable Disclosure Requirements regulation. If approved, this would change the nature of corporate reporting and bring it more in line with the EU's approach. If investors really care about combating climate change, they need to understand and ultimately account for both the financial and non-financial portfolio effects of their investments. An approach that focuses purely on financial impact ignores the fundamental mission of the net zero push to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere.    Netting out short and long exposures is no longer viable when you consider the impact the portfolio would have on the environment. Shorting a high-carbon-emitting company may provide financial de-risking benefits, but it does not reduce the tonnes of CO2 released into the atmosphere. Moreover, there is no equivalency between short selling and offsetting. A short is neither a carbon offset nor a sink to store carbon. Even carbon offsets, which can be contentious given questions about their role and quality, at least operate on the understanding that they are minimising and ideally reducing CO2 atmospheric emissions. Short selling does not even do that. The point we are making is not that short selling cannot be beneficial in an environmental, social and governance context. It can. Indeed, engagement with companies on carbon issues even among those being shorted is a powerful means to help steer them on the path to a world of net zero emissions. Shorting on the basis of ESG factors can also increase a portfolio's exposure to market signals from them. This has the potential to deliver above market returns, or alpha, or to increase the speed of recovery from asset price falls. But shorting cannot plausibly be considered an offset. An approach that largely relies on leverage, short exposure and notional reporting rather than real-world impact will come across as inauthentic and likely not endear hedge funds to the climate cause. In the push for net zero, where investor commitments have already been met with a degree of scepticism, hedge funds should avoid giving critics another excuse to attack them.

8e0e276888dc099c18a8,2022-02-18,Ignoring climate crisis is what will make us poorer,"Letters Gregory Shenkman (Letters, February 16) claims that Adam Smith made it clear that the best outcomes for all result from ""free markets and enlightened self-interest"", and that current environmental, social and governance investment practices, since they are inconsistent with a free market, will make us all poorer in every respect. I'm not sure Smith did say quite that. But if he did, he was not taking into account the ubiquity of the ""prisoner's dilemma"". This is where a group of individuals, each of whom acts out of self-interest, all do worse than if they had co-operated with one another. The obvious current example is climate change, which is much more likely to make us all poorer in every respect than ESG investing. Nor is it clear why such investing is inconsistent with a free market. Investors make their own informed choices about which products to buy, and prices will depend on the market rather than on any kind of objectionable governmental interference.

d9620d17daa16ccafa19,2022-02-17,Tea and sustainability,"CVC's €4.5bn deal to buy Unilever's tea business means it will also be responsible for thousands of workers on plantations in Africa, putting the buyout group's ethical commitments in the spotlight. By Andres Schipani; Judith Evans; Kaye Wiggins As Hellen Nyaboke and her family tried desperately to flee attackers on the Kenyan tea estate where she lived and worked, her husband Kenneth Mayenga was killed with a machete. One of her sons was beaten to death. Stricken by terror that she would be next, she hid among the tea bushes. Nyaboke has spent half her life working for one of the world's largest consumer goods groups, Unilever. But after the violence, fuelled by ethnic tensions, broke out amid a disputed election in 2007, she says the company did little to help. Nyaboke says she received Ks12,000 (£78) in compensation after the attacks, and with the help of the company, she and other survivors fled to Kisii County more than 40 miles away. But the 48-year-old believes she should have received more after losing two family members and enduring six months without pay after the violence. ""The only thing we were left with was the clothes we were wearing,"" says Nyaboke. ""All these years I tried to get fair compensation from Unilever but it was not possible ... they ignored me."" Almost 15 years after the attack on the plantation in Kericho, in which at least seven people were killed and 56 women raped, according to a complaint filed with UN human rights bodies, many workers are still seeking compensation and funds for medical treatment from Unilever. The company says it provided ""significant support"" to the victims of the 2007 violence, including medical aid, counselling, replacements for looted possessions and retraining options. But the complaint to the UN ? filed by 218 Kenyans last year, alleges that Unilever knowingly placed its workers at heightened risk of attack, failed to help them afterwards and stopped their wages for six months. The relationship between the company and the plantation workers is complex and unusual in the corporate world. Unilever provides housing, education and healthcare services for workers and their families at the plantation in Kericho. But, those ties are about to be broken after Unilever agreed to sell its tea business ? owner of PG Tips, Lipton and Brooke Bond, along with plantations in Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania ? for €4.5bn to private equity group CVC Capital Partners. The legacy of the violence, along with what workers describe as harsh day-today conditions in an industry known for hard labour and low pay, presents a challenge for the buyout group that will take the plantation on. The private equity industry has increasingly touted its sustainability credentials, as the pension funds that fuel its dealmaking have started asking more questions about ethical standards. ""CVC has an ingrained commitment to environmental, social and governance issues and has made them central to our investment process and the stewardship of our businesses,"" the company says. It adds that the consultancy firm EY visited the plantation in Kericho for CVC ? part of its due diligence before its bid ? and found Unilever had ""industryleading"" policies and procedures. EY declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.    Unilever says it ""fully rejects any allegation that it failed in a duty of care to employees or their families in the tragic events following the disputed 2007 elections in Kenya. An international commission of inquiry clearly concluded that the scale and speed of the violence that erupted was unforeseeable and Unilever Tea Kenya took all possible steps at the time to protect staff and dependants, subsequently providing significant support to all affected."" Two of the three final bidders for the tea business, buyout groups Advent International and Carlyle, pulled out, at least partly, over concerns surrounding the plantations. An indication, say people close to both buyout groups, that even in private equity, with its relentless focus on profit maximisation, fears over the social or reputational consequences of deals are gaining traction, as ethics and sustainability rise up investors' agendas. The deal has become a testing ground for how private equity groups approach workers' pay, conditions and safety in a climate where investors are scrutinising their ethics. ""The whole ESG [environmental, social and governance] lens across these sorts of investments is so much more of a factor than it was before,"" says one person involved in the deal. From the plant to the teapot Unilever's Kericho plantation, established by a Briton called Malcolm Fyers Bell for the Brooke Bond tea company in 1924, was the first commercial tea estate in Kenya. Keen to expand tea cultivaspecial tion outside China, the British set up plantations in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries. They often brought a workforce from elsewhere to the remote areas suited to tea growing, says Sabita Banerji, CEO of Thirst, a group campaigning for human rights and sustainability in the tea industry. Plantation founders created ""a structure of having a workforce that lives on the tea plantation, in housing provided by the management, and therefore completely dependent on [the management] for their livelihoods. That has persisted, not only in India, where it started, but it spread through the British empire to Kenya, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh,"" Banerji says. Unilever has built 23 primary schools, 50 nurseries, housing for 30,000 people, 23 pharmacies and a hospital in Kericho. It also offers paid annual leave, paternity and maternity pay, and transport allowances, plus free food during working hours, the company adds. The Financial Times did not visit its plantation in Kericho, where Covid-19 restrictions are in place, but spoke to former workers and union members in the neighbouring town. Sir Thomas Lipton, founder of Lipton tea, Unilever's largest tea brand, established a plantation in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, in 1890. He boasted, as Unilever's tea division ? now known as Ekaterra ? does today, of owning the supply chain from plant to teapot. Lipton and his contemporaries brought tea to the mass market. But the model they pioneered has left the industry operating on narrow margins and tea workers, a largely female workforce, vulnerable. Between 2008 and 2013, a Dutch NGO and a TV documentary separately alleged sexual harassment of women workers by some of the senior staff on Unilever's Kericho estate. Unilever introduced new training, more female leaders, dedicated welfare and human resources roles, peer counsellors and an ethics hotline. The complaint against Unilever over the 2007 violence was lodged with the UN working group on human rights and transnational corporations and the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. It alleges some victims received about £80, equivalent to one month's wages, in assistance, but this ""represented a small fraction of the loss of wages and possessions they had suffered"". If the complaint is upheld, the UN bodies could find Unilever to be in violation of UN principles and recommend it address any shortcomings, but they cannot enforce penalties. Even so, such a rebuke from the UN would leave a black mark on Unilever's record. Successive chief executives, going back decades, have emphasised the company's dedication to sustainability and social purpose, helping the group to score highly on ESG metrics. Chief executive Alan Jope has pledged to pay all workers in the company's supply chain a living wage by 2030; Unilever says Ekaterra will retain that pledge after the sale. Yet two former executives say the company has struggled to apply its principles at the plantations. One says Unilever paid better wages than rivals but battled to reconcile fixed costs with volatile tea prices. ""The consumer price of tea has to be determined by what the market can pay,"" he adds.    Francis Atwoli, secretary-general of Kenya's Central Organization of Trade Unions, says Unilever had formerly been ""the best employer"" but in recent years its Kenyan arm had been ""overwhelmed by maximisation of profits"". Daniel Leader, a lawyer at Leigh Day who represents some victims of the 2007 violence, says that if Unilever is found to have breached UN principles in Kenya, ""that would inevitably beg the question as to whether Unilever practices what it preaches"". Profit maximisation The company is currently reviewing its compensation payouts after the 2007 violence. ""Unilever Tea Kenya ... felt that the right thing to do was to review if any claimants had not received the support it offered to other employees at the time and, if so, to make up for what they missed,"" it says. Thulsi Narayanasamy, head of labour rights at the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre ? a non-profit organisation not involved in the UN complaint ? argues that as the world's largest tea maker Unilever could have pushed for a better deal for workers. Unilever ""has really significant leverage when it comes to the pricing of tea across its global supply chain. This is where the cost that it decides to pay really sets the standard for the industry,"" she says. Over the past decade, there have been profound changes on the plantation in Kericho after Unilever introduced tea harvesting machines, leading to job cuts. Dickson Sang, secretary of the Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers' Union in Kericho County, says the number of staff on the Kericho site eligible to join a union dwindled from 25,000 to 12,000, of whom only 4,000 are permanent employees. Unilever says 5,500 permanent workers are now employed there. Hand pluckers say their daily pay fell as they had to walk long distances to find tea that the machines had not picked. Pay is determined by the quantity of tea harvested, but Unilever says it is always topped up to a daily minimum. The company denies that mechanisation has affected pay rates, saying ""changes in take-home wages for field plucking staff may vary because of the seasonal nature of tea crops, or because some workers pick more in a day than others ? not because of mechanisation"". Geoffrey Nyambane had earned Ks30,000 (£195) a month before mechanisation but afterwards his pay dropped closer to the union minimum, coming in at less than Ks12,400 in February 2018, the year he left, according to payslips. For Nyaboke, starting in January 2016, her monthly pay fell to less than half of her normal basic wage, she says. Unilever says its union-agreed minimum pay rates are about two and a half times Kenya's minimum agricultural wage. Unable to find work elsewhere, Nyaboke remained a Unilever employee until she took a voluntary retirement deal in December 2018. There were no compulsory redundancies, but Sang says many workers struggled with lower pay and reluctantly agreed these retirement deals, which in 2018 included 23 days' pay for each year of service, notice and leave pay, and a one-way bus fare. Those with more than 10 years' service received 55 days' pay per year worked. Unilever says the early retirement offer was oversubscribed, adding: ""All workers granted voluntary retirement were given the terms clearly set out."" With elections due in August, there are concerns for those still with the company. Sang says new security measures are needed. ""If things are not done now, with the [next] election we could have a similar scenario of violence,"" he adds. By then, Unilever's tea arm may be owned by Luxembourg-based CVC, which agreed to buy the business in a deal expected to be completed in the second half of this year. Under the deal, CVC will be sheltered from any potential future cost of claims over the treatment of workers during Unilever's ownership, a common move when corporations carve out and sell business units, a person with knowledge of the matter says. Advent and Carlyle both dropped out at a late stage in the bidding auction. Advent excluded the plantations from its offer for the group, which was more than €750mn below CVC's winning bid, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Carlyle dropped out just days before the bid deadline. Advent's executives were worried about the cost and difficulty of supporting a workforce that is dependent on the plantation for their livelihood, and the potential for bad headlines should things go wrong, says a person close to    the private equity firm. ""The plantations are a whole different ball game"" compared with situations private equity firms are used to, says a second person close to the Advent bid. ""You take on responsibility for these workers' health, their education, their protection."" Carlyle had similar concerns, a person close to its bid says. ""This is not like buying a factory where everyone goes home at the end of the day,"" he adds. A 'real opportunity' for CVC CVC did not buy the company predominantly for its plantations. Instead, dealmakers saw a chance to apply a well established profit maximisation strategy: separate an unloved unit of a large conglomerate in the hope it will attract a higher valuation on its own. That means expanding the market share of brands that CVC believes Unilever has neglected, potentially paving the way for a listing or sale at a higher multiple of earnings in a few years' time. ""While there are always areas in any business that can be improved on"", CVC says, ""there is a real opportunity here to act as a responsible ESG-focused investor."" Labour rights advocates are sceptical. The problems on the plantation demonstrate how institutional investors are overly focused on assessing ""the human rights policies of companies, rather than the implementation of those policies,"" says Narayanasamy. She fears the sale will not help. ""The potential for this sale to have really significant ramifications, driving down working conditions and human rights, is very considerable,"" she says. ""It's much harder to hold a private equity company to account.""

d4272ed2223a96ddabfc,2022-02-16,Stick with Adam Smith's enlightened self-interest,"Letters Tariq Fancy quotes Larry Fink denying stakeholder capitalism is woke (Opinion, February 11). But it is woke, along with Fink's view that capitalism should better serve the public interest. Who is Fink, or any other group of unelected persons, to define the public interest? That is the function of democratic government. As Adam Smith made clear, the best outcomes for all result from free markets and enlightened self-interest. Companies belong to their shareholders and the vast majority of shareholders are concerned purely with the return on investment, which should be the focus of company boards and senior executives. Of course, companies must respect regulations that protect employees and the public good, but these standards and regulations must be determined under the aegis of democratically elected governments, not by groups of senior executives like Fink, or selfappointed pressure groups or academics. That way leads to dangerous groupthink. Theories about environmental, social and governance investing are just that: theories. Many of us are doubtful of almost every single element of the ESG agenda, which is too often driven by people who prefer to earn their crust by interfering unhelpfully with those at the sharp end. Such people obviously have an economic interest in pushing the ESG agenda. Society at large does not. If ESG holds sway, I predict it will make us all poorer in every respect.

1986a4afb65322470c46,2022-02-15,Fund managers stock up on US oil and gas bonds as energy prices lift finances,"Fixed income Investors are loading up on the debt of US oil and gas companies, lured by their ability to generate cash again as energy prices soar. Funds now hold overweight positions in high-yield energy bonds compared with a benchmark index, according to Bank of America Global Research. This means that, instead of simply trying to track the proportion of energy sector bonds in the index, investors are choosing to own much more. Investors' appetite for energy bonds comes as crude oil prices stage a ferocious recovery, more than doubling since late 2020 to $90 a barrel, their highest in seven years. Natural gas prices have also rallied. Range Resources, a shale gas producer active in the Appalachian region, raised $500mn in January, receiving twice as much investor demand as typical oil and gas deals, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal. The strong appetite for the debt helped Range almost halve its interest costs, with the coupon on the eight-year deal dropping to 4.75 per cent, well below the 9.25 per cent coupon on the debt the proceeds were used to repay. Investors noted that since the pandemic, many financially weaker energy companies have either restructured their debt or like Chesapeake Energy, a pioneer of the shale revolution gone through bankruptcy. Energy debt accounted for more than a third of $141bn in high-yield defaults in 2020, according to JPMorgan, leaving behind stronger names. Crashing oil prices in early 2020 also prompted downgrades of several higher-rated, investment-grade companies such as Occidental Petroleum, raising the overall quality of the companies now in the high-yield bond market. Rating agencies have recently upgraded several shale oil and gas companies, reflecting stronger balance sheets for a sector once notorious for profligate spending. Alongside pledges of capital discipline, operators such as Range, Chesapeake, Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy have stressed their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations, if not from the combustion of the fuels they produce. These commitments, made as more investors take environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into account, have also helped the appetite for energy debt, investors said. ""We do look at ESG factors when we look at energy names,"" said Nichole Hammond, a high-yield portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors. ""We focus on the better operators that want to improve. It does ultimately come down to credit, but there is more and more layering of ESG metrics."" Others said that energy companies' improved financial prospects had simply moved ESG priorities to the background. ""I think folks have hidden behind ESG when oil prices were just lower,"" said one debt banker. ""ESG has gone to the back burner.""    Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have also helped the appetite for energy debt"
f956bae7f5829695d637,2022-02-15,Bluebell gives fresh air to Glencore's coal debate,"lencore is cleaning up in coal. G Bumper results for last year will owe a hefty chunk of earnings to the ultrapolluting commodity. That risks clouding a debate, given fresh air yesterday by activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners, about how best to run down coalproducing assets. Glencore touts itself as the miner supplying the commodities the world needs to decarbonise. It has the copper required for increasing electrification as consumers shift away from fossil fuels, the nickel and the cobalt for batteries to power electric cars. But it is also one of the world's largest producers of thermal coal, a product used to generate electricity, the price of which has rocketed over the past year. Investors don't want to own coal, bankers don't want to fund it, but faced with soaring natural gas prices, governments still want to burn it. Other big miners have concluded coal is not worth the ESG strife from investors and sold out. Glencore's resistance shows a consensus is yet to emerge. The commodities trader insists it is the best owner of its coal mines and that running them down over roughly the next 30 years is the ""responsible strategy for both our business and for the world"". Bluebell last year called that ""morally unacceptable and financially flawed"" in a missive to the board. Its follow-up letter argues the debate should be about how Glencore spins off coal, not whether it should. The argument is not an all-or-nothing fight about divestment. Big investors now back strategies premised on the idea of responsible run-off. And while concern might have previously centred on sales of assets to private, unaccountable owners, recent experience on the public markets has added fuel to the fire of divestment sceptics. Days after miner Anglo American spun off its South African coal assets in the form of Johannesburg-listed Thungela, Thungela's boss told Bloomberg bluntly: ""I didn't take up this role to close these mines"". Far from proving uninvestable, Thungela's share price has more than tripled as thermal coal prices have risen. Glencore argues that, as a diversified commodities group, it can be trusted not to invest to extend the life of coal assets even if it has expanded its ownership of Colombian coal mine Cerrejón. Bluebell's latest proposal takes Glencore's claim that it is best-placed to run down the assets at face value. But it then challenges the company to commit to doing so even if it doesn't receive the full benefit of the assets. The hedge fund suggests Glencore could keep control of the spun-off thermal coal business via 100 per cent of the voting rights, and retain full marketing rights. But it would cede 91 per cent of the economic interest in the demerged company. This would clean up the investment case for Glencore. Meanwhile, Glencore's continued involvement would remove some of the tarnish of investing in a pure-play coal company.    Maybe Bluebell's plan is unnecessarily complex. Dual-share structures are unpopular with London investors, who are very attached to the ""one share one vote"" principle. It is hard to know what valuation bump Glencore might get and whether the pure-play coal company might trade at a larger discount because of the convoluted governance structure. But solutions to the problem of phasing out coal are unlikely to be simple. Glencore's strategy calls on investors to trust it to do the right thing for the environment. That is no small ask from a company that has had its run-ins with regulators over the years. Investors may instead trust in Glencore's ability to do the right thing for its bottom line. For now, running down coal is not inconsistent with that. At some point though, the ""responsible strategy"" for Glencore's business and the world may well diverge. It is at that point that investors will need to grapple with far more complex proposals for cleaning up coal than Bluebell's. cat.rutterpooley@ft.com The miner's strategy asks investors to trust it on the environment, no small ask given past regulatory rows"
5277cbe240a595a9f981,2022-02-14,Investors urge Pemex to reduce ESG risks,"Mexico's debt-laden energy group is at centre of state self-sufficiency plans but fund managers want it to clean up its act Standing before an onshore oil well in his home state of Tabasco, Mexico president Andrés Manuel López Obrador last March made familiar promises to halt the privatisation of energy and save the country's oil industry for the people. ""We're rescuing Pemex, and we're rescuing the nation,"" the president said, nodding to the national oil and gas company. His state-led vision for the country's energy policy and Pemex celebrates the past. But it is threatened by a more 21st century concern: the lack of a concrete environmental, social and governance strategy as its peers pivot towards a greener future. That could become a problem for Pemex which is fully state-owned and has a debt pile of more than $100bn as debt investors are increasingly screening out companies that perform badly on ESG metrics, bondholders have said. Greenhouse gas emissions at the oil behemoth, created in 1938 after Mexico expropriated US and UK oil assets, rose in 2019 and 2020. In 2020 greenhouse gas emissions in extraction and production were 31.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per thousand barrels. That is more than a third above that year's target of 23.34 tonnes per thousand barrels. Most oil and gas majors are not managing overall emission reductions. However, many were improving on carbon intensity and had longer-dated targets than Pemex, said Jonathon Smith, ESG research manager, oil and gas at Sustainalytics, a unit of Morningstar. Sustainalytics placed Pemex in 253rd place out of 261 in a ranking of how well oil and gas producers were managing ESG risks. The ratings and data provider judged Pemex's exposure to risks associated with emissions and worker safety as ""severe"". Recent results from ExxonMobil, Chevron and others show that despite promises of a greener future decades down the line, betting on oil can still be highly profitable for investors when prices rise. Part of the attraction of Pemex is the higher return on offer in comparison to the Mexican government or its peers. Pemex's latest 10-year bond sold in December offers a yield of more than 7 per cent, while a 12-year dollardenominated sovereign bond issued in January pays a yield of about 4 per cent. While investors such as Fidelity, Capital Group and BlackRock all hold more than $1bn in Pemex debt, a clearer ESG plan is regarded as crucial to luring more investors that might push up prices and help reduce the company's borrowing costs. ""The incremental spread you get on their bonds is multiples higher than any other quasi-government oil company ... the ESG overhang is adding to the pain,"" said Akbar Causer, an emerging market debt portfolio manager at Eaton Vance. ""As more managers have ESG restrictions, more managers aren't able to hold Pemex's debt in    their portfolios."" Although Latin America is home to some of the energy industry's last fossil fuel holdouts, analysts agree that Pemex lags behind other national oil companies in the region such as Brazil's Petrobras and Colombia's Ecopetrol on ESG matters. Despite some scepticism, it is also starkly at odds with plans by large groups such as Shell, BP and Total that have all set net zero emissions targets and are investing in renewables as they manage the energy transition. ""If they [Pemex] want to remain a viable company for the medium to long term they have to implement ESG,"" said Aaron Gifford, emerging markets sovereign analyst at T Rowe Price, one of the largest holders of Pemex bonds. Although Pemex's emissions targets are not well publicised, Gifford and others have seen some signs of improvement in the past couple of years. The group has started to mention ESG briefly in quarterly reports, including an indicator on natural gas flaring, is engaging privately with investors, and said in its most recent quarterly earnings that it had identified 209 environmental risks, although it provided little detail. Alex Collins, an emerging market corporate analyst at Pemex bondholder BlueBay Asset Management, said he had been engaging with the group for 18 months on ESG. He said it did care about becoming a more responsible corporate citizen but had such a long list of priori- ties it was hard to move it up. Neither fund manager has plans to divest, but BlueBay warned that its clients increasingly ask it to screen out poor performance on ESG. Pemex's primary ESG issues are around emissions and the environment as well as its record on accidents and worker safety, according to analysts. Pemex did not respond to a request for comment. Now the president's nationalist vision is making it even harder to allocate the time and capital for a climate-focused transition. After he was elected in 2018, López Obrador inherited Pemex with a huge debt pile built up over years of declining production and bad investments, massive quarterly losses and in the throes of a major reform instigated by a previous administration that opened it up to private competition for the first time in its history. Many analysts believe the best business strategy would be for the company to focus on its more profitable exploration and production arm while making a credible plan to address ESG. But López Obrador has instead prioritised the downstream business in his quest to make the country energy ""selfsufficient"". He wants to stop exporting crude and importing petroleum products and instead extract, refine and use them locally. The government has been criticised for its doubling down on fossil fuels, including trying to pass a constitutional reform to guarantee more than half the electricity market to state company CFE. Critics say the reform will make electricity more expensive and halt private investment in renewables. At the end of last year, Pemex said it would, in effect, stop crude exports by 2023. ""The plan is unrealistic and is unlikely to develop in the official timeframe,"" said Nicholas Watson, managing director at Teneo. Octavio Romero Oropeza, Pemex's chief executive, offers little challenge. An agronomist with no previous oil sector experience, he is a longtime collaborator of López Obrador's. López Obrador has followed through on pledges to support the company financially, something to which bond investors have long paid keen attention. The government cut a key tax rate Pemex pays to 40 per cent in 2022, down from more than 65 per cent in 2019. It also recently agreed to buy back some bonds and swap others worth more than $3bn. About a third of the company's capital expenditure this year will go into the new complex at Dos Bocas in Tabasco, according to an investor presentation from June. Last year it bought out partner Shell's stake in their Texas Deer Park refinery. In tandem with the financial support, the finance ministry promised a reformulated business plan for the company, but it faces a tall order to placate investors and analysts who want to see progress both on ESG and the fundamental strategy. ""It's going to be interesting to see what exactly this whole ... plan really entails,"" said John Padilla, partner at Latin America-based energy consultancy IPD. ""If it doesn't address ESG, if it doesn't address the refining dynamic, if it doesn't address the fundamental issues that you've got with production, then it's just more window dressing.""

Failure to find better ways of incentivising people and building a healthier workplace environment means the British legal industry risks losing talent to more enlightened sectors. There are some good examples of progressive firms. Those tend to have leadership teams that champion diversity and inclusion, encourage a modern work-life balance, and are creating physical environments and culture that are much more meaningful than relying on huge, but ultimately one-dimensional, starter salaries and ad hoc payments.

e39f9cec083734afa65c,2022-02-12,UK-EU rule split risks ESG complexity,"INVESTING Confusion and extra costs could be in store for British savers ESG investment could become more complicated for British savers with a growing risk of divergence between European and UK sustainability disclosure rules. While stronger standards for funds focused on environmental, social and governance goals (ESG) have been welcomed by investment specialists, the industry has warned of increased confusion and high costs if the UK charts a different course from Europe. UK regulators are drawing up proposals on the sustainability disclosure requirements set to pass at the end of the year, following new EU rules which came into effect in March last year. ""A proliferation of differing sustainable finance disclosure frameworks by multiple jurisdictions carries the risk of adding to complexity, cost and confusion for investors,"" said Johan Vanderlugt, sustainable finance specialist at Kempen Capital Management. ""Challenges can arise when disclosure regulations differ too much, for example around interpretation, implementation and monitoring."" The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is currently drafting a labelling system for funds, to categorise their sustainable credentials. The proposed framework includes five labels, to be mapped out against the existing three European categories. The UK regulator acknowledges that many British firms have ""already invested in systems and processes to classify [their] products"" to comply with Europe's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Fragmented approaches could run the risk of not treating consumers fairly and consistently, says the Investment Association, a UK trade body, calling for ""as little divergence as possible"" in the scope of products covered. ""There is a risk that the [proposed labels] could also prove too complex and difficult for consumers to understand,"" it adds. The introduction of European sustainability disclosure rules helped drive global sustainable fund assets to almost $2.7tn at the end of the last quarter last year, according to data provider Morningstar. The region accounted for almost 80 per cent of global flows into sustainable funds in the same quarter. Nicolas Mackel, the chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, a promotion agency, says that fragmented regimes would ""increase costs"" and, ultimately, investors' fees. Despite the anticipated cost burden of divergence, some professional investors hope that building its own rule book will offer Britain a chance to improve on areas where EU rules fall short. ""The FCA has the opportunity to learn,"" says Mirza Baig, head of ESG at Aviva Investors, which holds £357bn under management. Critics of the European framework point to the breadth of some sustainability categories, which can be difficult to implement.    Sacha Sadan, head of ESG at the FCA, said some local regulators were looking to add to the EU framework to make it more effective. Both the French and German regulators had published their own guidance. Some investors worry that the rigid fund classifications demanded by both EU and British regulators could discourage investment in socalled ""brown"" companies ? such as steel groups ? working to improve their ESG credentials, notably through slashing emissions.

1e4efbb316adde69a861,2022-02-11,"Morningstar removes 1,200 funds from sustainable investing list","Asset management Morningstar has removed more than 1,200 funds with a combined $1.4tn in assets from its European sustainable investment list after an ""extensive review"" of their legal documents. The data provider dropped the funds from its ""sustainable universe"" last year after closely examining disclosures provided to investors such as prospectuses and annual reports. The cull underscores the challenge in ensuring sustainable investment products meet customers' expectations and make a positive impact on the environment while regulators try to formalise definitions and best practice. ""Morningstar data analysts have revisited these disclosures and tightened their criteria to tag funds as sustainable investments in the database,"" analysts wrote in a research paper. In November, Morningstar published a report following on from the EU 's rules on sustainability disclosures implemented in March 2021. The paper said that the European sustainable fund universe had expanded 65 per cent between June and September, from 3,730 to 6,147 funds. Researchers at the time concluded that the introduction of European disclosure rules had fuelled a boom in investing in line with environmental, social and corporate governance criteria, and said the continent accounted for 88 per cent of the market in these products. However, the research firm said last week that after conducting further due diligence, it had removed more than 1,000 funds from its list, ""including many that listed ESG criteria to selfclassify as promoting environmental and/or social characteristics"" under European disclosure rules. The assets under management of funds Morningstar considered to be sustainable at the end of September 2021 fell to $2.03tn from $3.4tn following the adjustment, claims data Morningstar showed to the Financial Times . Most of the removed funds had declared their credentials under the EU 's ""light green"" Article 8 section of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, which imposes ESG reporting for asset managers, Morningstar said. This category is meant for funds ""promoting"" environmental or social characteristics or both, provided that the underlying companies have good governance. On a closer look, Morningstar had discovered problems including ""ambiguous language in their legal filings"", said Hortense Bioy , global director of sustainability research at Morningstar. The group declined to disclose the names of the funds it had removed. Analysts discovered problems including 'ambiguous language in their legal filings'"
ee5077facd5e54a1f377,2022-02-11,Stakeholder capitalism requires corporate America to come clean,"T he annual letter written by Larry Fink, chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, to the CEOs of America's biggest corporations is always closely scrutinised. This year's missive, published in January, was no exception. Fink continued a theme he'd broached before, arguing for what he calls ""stakeholder capitalism"" as the best way of tackling pressing societal challenges, including climate change. This is a rejection of Milton Friedman's argument that businesses should prioritise profits for shareholders above all else. It is not ""woke"" for a company to focus on all of its stakeholders instead of shareholders alone, Fink told recipients of his letter. Indeed it can surely only be to the good for capitalism to better serve the public interest especially for the youngest, poorest and most diverse communities in the world, who are also those most exposed to the risks of continued inaction on the climate crisis. Since Fink first asked CEOs to embrace ""social purpose"" in his 2018 letter, PR, marketing, revenues and profits from environmental, social and governance (ESG) products have soared but so have carbon emissions, inequality and a host of other social ills that these products are meant to address. Too frequently in corporate life, ""purpose"" and profit do not overlap sufficiently to drive any meaningful change on the timelines required. Business today is like a competitive sport where players can score points and win by playing dirty. Corporations are playing the game in ways that harm the public interest, driven by a complex web of legal obligations and financial incentives designed to extract profits over purpose at every turn. Existing models of stakeholder capitalism require people who have done business in certain ways their entire careers to embrace ""social purpose"", even though they remain incentivised to do the opposite. So here's an idea: why don't we move to a model based on mandatory compliance? In competitive sports, when a game turns dirty, we ask expert referees to enforce the rules. By switching to a model of stakeholder capitalism that is based on mandatory compliance and enforced by impartial referees, we increase its chances of success by applying a simple, common-sense aphorism: trust, but verify. This requires governments to step in and ensure that the game is played fairly. Unfortunately, there is a significant barrier. Dirty players can pay the referees, undermining their impartiality and protecting loopholes that boost short-term profits but harm the longterm public interest. In the wake of the US Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, unknown amounts of untraceable corporate spending intended to influence elections and legislation have been sloshing around the system. It is no wonder that a majority of Americans feel that the economy is rigged to favour the wealthiest and most powerful. The majority of both Democrats and Republicans support a constitutional amendment that would in effect overturn the Citizens United decision a rare issue on which there is bipartisan agreement among Americans. Yet even as America's largest corporations prepare glossy corporate social responsibility reports and marketing    campaigns trumpeting social purpose, they fight off shareholder resolutions demanding greater disclosure around their political spending and lobbying activities. This discrepancy is odd. If you were interested in cleaning up a basketball game, would you care more about the talking points players offered on the importance of good sportsmanship interviews or whether or not they're secretly paying the refs behind the scenes? To be clear, the government does not actually have to build the solutions we need. There is a difference between government as provider and government as regulator. Government should no more build electric vehicles than referees should take free throws. But if the referees don't call the fouls and enforce the boundaries, who will? We are at an important fork in the road. If stakeholder capitalism fails, the political foundations of the system itself are at risk. I believe in the power of capitalism, but it must better serve the interests of all stakeholders. In pursuit of that goal, those with a voice and a platform should ask corporate America to help ensure the success of stakeholder capitalism by disclosing clearly how much it is paying the referees. Even better, they could start a campaign to stop these payments entirely.

c4436e9b25c5a4b6fefa,2022-02-10,Amundi: too large to foil,"Twitter: @FTLex Valérie Baudson's debut year running Europe's largest asset manager went well. Amundi of France said assets under management surpassed €2tn as net profits rose 37 per cent in its fullyear results yesterday. Surging stock markets and bank accounts full of cash helped it hit profit targets early. Shares rose nearly 5 per cent on the day. Its diversified model should help it weather feared 2022 turbulence. ETF manager Lyxor, bought from Société Générale for €825mn last April, has added €148bn of assets. These put it behind only BlackRock in European ETFs. Big is best in this sector. Any future fee erosion in the traditional active fund management business should be offset by two areas. To begin with, Amundi's exposure to fast-growing emerging markets should soon feature more in its valuation. Joint ventures in politically risky China and in India help offset its stolid business at home. Its shares are trading at 11 times next year's earnings, a nearly 40 per cent discount to floundering Abrdn. The group's Indian joint venture with State Bank of India, of which Amundi owns 37 per cent, should have its IPO this summer. Given its soaring funds under management, this stake could be worth $3.5bn. That relies on a growth 40 times forward earnings multiple for similar local firms. Amundi plans to sell 4 per cent, significant against its expected operating earnings of about $1.9bn this year Another supporting strand is its strength in environmental, social and governance, where active strategies accounted for €56bn from the total of €76bn of net inflows last year. Net flows into ESG strategies accounted for 40 per of that active total. ESG assets under management more than doubled to €847bn, helped by rising tech stocks which are the largest in the category. Amundi ranks best in class for its ESG offering, scoring higher above rivals in the all-important climate category, thinks Citi. Its shares still offer good value, considering its scale and earnings potential."
4c2c34b4ffd0eef9e393,2022-02-09,"Women spoke up, men cried conspiracy: inside Axel Springer's #MeToo moment","FT investigation The German publisher's chief, Mathias Döpfner, fought to protect his top editor, Julian Reichelt, from allegations of misconduct. Erika Solomon, Olaf Storbeck, Kaye Wiggins and Arash Massoudi report I n the spring of 2021, after six bruising weeks of a compliance investigation, senior employees at Axel Springer thought they had defused a crisis. The German publisher had just reinstated Julian Reichelt as head of Bild, Europe's top-selling daily newspaper. An external probe by law firm Freshfields found the editor-in-chief had abused his power by promoting and demoting young women he had slept with. Others received unwanted ""romantic"" messages. Yet Reichelt had committed no criminal wrongdoing, the law firm found, nor had he broken company rules. Axel Springer told the public that Reichelt had made ""mistakes"". Still, one senior employee told a board member that the written report, if leaked, was ""not survivable"". Any outsider who read it, this person quipped, would ask who was replacing Reichelt as the editor of Bild. Reichelt's head would not be the only one on the block, the board member shot back. ""Also: 'Who is the new CEO?' And: 'Who is the new head of news media?' If this gets out, it's at the very least difficult for us. We're all in the same boat."" Over the course of a three-month investigation, the Financial Times was able to verify the authenticity of this internal conversation from the spring of 2021, when it seemed the Reichelt episode might be forgotten. ""For now we have calm,"" the board member said. ""If it remains that way, it was just a shitty six weeks."" Instead, the real trouble was yet to come. Summoned for sex On October 17, a transcript from the investigators' files was quoted in a New York Times column. What that transcript described seemed worse than ""mistakes"": a female employee who was given an unexpected promotion by Reichelt and summoned for sex in hotel rooms. The article came just as Axel Springer was making a momentous step in the US media market, with the near-$1bn purchase of Politico, its biggest acquisition. On October 18, Reichelt was fired. Axel Springer cited ""new findings"" over a continuing relationship with a Bild employee, and said Reichelt had been ""untruthful"" to the board. The company said it had ""no knowledge of key interview transcripts"" referenced in the press. Yet several people involved have told the FT that Axel Springer was aware of the most serious allegations against Reichelt even before Freshfields was appointed. At some points, senior executives discussed the investigation with Reichelt, advising him to deny everything. In the process, some of the very people the probe was meant to protect were exposed.    During the investigation and even after its conclusion, Axel Springer's chief executive Mathias Döpfner and his top brass rallied to protect the editor. Half-truths in the publisher's statements obscured the scale of Reichelt's wrongdoing. The Reichelt drama offers an insight into a powerful publisher that aims to create ""the leading digital media company of the democratic world"". It also sheds light on the workings of some of the world's biggest private investors that bought a large stake in Axel Springer in 2019. Private equity giant KKR and Canada's state pension fund each control billions of dollars and own stakes in hundreds of companies. Both say they play an active role in social and governance issues; but both were willing to support his reinstatement after behaviour that has led to dismissals in other companies. More broadly, the fallout from the Reichelt affair shows the inherent tension of compliance investigations a system of corporate governance riddled with conflicts that is paid for, managed and communicated by a company itself. Axel Springer said questions sent by the FT contained ""wrong facts, assumptions, insinuations and conclusions"", adding: ""As we are subject to various confidentiality obligations, we cannot answer all questions in the requested detail."" The company said that it was ""false"" to say that the management feared the results of the investigation could harm their own jobs and reputation, but added: ""Of course in retrospect we have to admit that we did not do everything right. Our biggest mistake was that we trusted [Reichelt] too long. We deeply regret this, particularly on behalf of employees who suffered from that."" Reichelt told the FT in a statement that allegations regarding his misconduct were ""lies"". The FT spoke to more than 30 people as part of its investigation, including dozens of in-depth interviews with former Bild employees and contractors, some of whom had sexual relationships with Reichelt and some who acted as whistleblowers. The FT also talked to several people who read the Freshfields report or were briefed on its content, as well as with Axel Springer's consent a co-author of the report. Pivotal moment The crisis involving one of Axel Springer's most influential editors came at a pivotal moment in the company's history. Established in 1946 by its eponymous founder, the publisher became an anti-Communist bulwark during the cold war and was bombed by leftwing militants in 1972. Today, the company harbours global ambitions. After losing out to Nikkei in the race to buy the FT in 2015, Axel Springer acquired Insider Inc, the publisher of Business Insider, and now owns a host of other digital news and classified sites. Aiming to make bolder moves, Döpfner, who sits on the board of Netflix, took the publisher private in 2019 with the backing of KKR and CPP Investments (CPPIB), which manages the Canadian pension fund. A former music critic, Döpfner is the intellectual face of the company. He joined Axel Springer as the editor of conservative broadsheet Die Welt in 1998. Outside his day job, he has launched a highbrow German art magazine and enjoys debating with academics and tech entrepreneurs. Quick to realise the opportunity and threat of digital media, Döpfner in 2013 sold part of the company's legacy print business to fund digital expansion. Döp- fner became a billionaire in 2020 after a gift of stock from Friede Springer, widow of the late founder, took his stake in the company to 22 per cent. The 79-year-old Springer also handed him the voting rights on her remaining 22 per cent stake. In Reichelt, 41, he found a kindred spirit with a more rugged image. Before climbing to the top of Bild in 2017, Reichelt had been regarded as one of Germany's best tabloid journalists. Enamoured with the US military after his time as a war correspondent, Reichelt used their lingo to sign off emails and kept a military camp bed in his office. Some editors and colleagues referred to him as Döpfner's ""political alter ego"". As Axel Springer's most influential and high-profile editor in Germany, Reichelt advocated provocative, ""antiwoke"" and sometimes libertarian views. They sparked outrage but sold papers and attracted clicks. With a print circulation of 1.2mn, the headlines at Bild were feared as much as they were courted among the political establishment and welcomed by the Axel Springer boss.    ""Mathias likes being important,"" one editor said. ""And if you have a brand people are afraid of, then people are afraid of you."" Hotel assignations Fear was also a common emotion among the women in Reichelt's life. In February 2021, Axel Springer's chief compliance officer, Florian von Götz, received a list of several women allegedly mistreated during affairs with Bild's top editor. One of the first he called was a former Bild employee who described hotel assignations with Reichelt near the offices. She had sex with him, she said, out of fear of losing her job. Reichelt had given her what was widely perceived as an undeserved promotion. In the months that followed, she sought clinical treatment for depression. The same day, von Götz and Jan Bayer, the head of news and a member of the executive board, visited an exgirlfriend of Reichelt. She alleged he had faked divorce papers to convince her he was no longer married, and had ensured she received contracts organising events for the paper. The woman requested that the meeting took place at her home because she was afraid to be seen at Axel Springer's headquarters. She told her visitors Reichelt had often intimidated her and that she feared he might hurt her. Another woman who spoke to von Götz by phone insisted she was too afraid even to tell an Axel Springer employee her story. Freshfields investigates The company decided an external party should handle an independent investigation, selecting Freshfields, whose team was led by former criminal prosecutor Simone Kämpfer, a leading whitecollar crime expert. During 34 interviews with 31 people over four weeks, Kämpfer and her investigators heard multiple stories of Reichelt repeatedly contacting young women at early stages of their careers, often offering to act as mentor or to get them jobs. Over a period of at least six years, including before he ascended to the top editorial job at Bild, Reichelt wooed and flattered them, invited them to dinner or drinks and sent unsolicited late-night text messages, sometimes expressing romantic or physical longing. In an anonymised and condensed form, this behaviour from Reichelt given the alias ""Thomas Schneider"" during the probe was described in the Freshfields report and conveyed to company management, the supervisory board and its investors. ""The Freshfields report addressed the identified issues clearly and with no bias towards the interests of the individuals involved in the matter,"" the law firm told the FT in a statement. Most women who gave testimony insisted on anonymity. Explaining her decision, one former employee told the FT: ""A couple of years back, I remember asking a lot of my colleagues, 'In theory, who would you go to, if you had a problem with Julian?' They would laugh."" During Reichelt's own questioning by Freshfields, one lawyer compared the workplace culture at Bild to Volkswagen during its emission-rigging scandal a company that was also investigated by Freshfields and which Der Spiegel once described as ""North Korea without the labour camps"". ""People are more afraid of you than of Martin Winterkorn, who will soon be in the dock,"" a Freshfields lawyer told Reichelt, referring to the former VW chief executive who is due to be a defendant in a criminal trial over the emissions affair. Other complaints, not included in the Freshfields investigation, went back years. As early as 2019, a female trainee told a senior editor that she was desperate to avoid Reichelt and that she planned to leave Bild because of him, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. ""Julian's behaviour towards young women was an open secret internally,"" said another former senior Bild editor who once advised a friend not to let her daughter become an intern at the paper because young, attractive women were seen as ""fair game"". The company told the FT: ""Maybe it was an open secret in the newsroom but the board members certainly had no idea.""    Between 2019 and 2020, at least five senior editors raised concerns to board member Stephanie Caspar, then in charge of the group's news operations, over what they saw as Reichelt's bullying behaviour and abusive language. Caspar denied ever hearing of inappropriate romantic or sexual behaviour by Reichelt prior to February 2021, stating she was aware only of several complaints over Reichelt's abrasive leadership style and a ""boys' club"" mentality. 'No grounds' for removal In mid-March, Reichelt was briefly suspended after the probe was made public by Der Spiegel only to be reinstated 12 days later, with Axel Springer announcing there were ""no grounds to remove him"", as Freshfields ""did not discover any evidence whatsoever of sexual harassment or coercion"". Von Götz seemed aware of the shock this would cause some of the complainants. ""I want to thank you once more for your openness,"" he told one woman, in correspondence seen by the FT. ""Please be assured how much I appreciate it, even if you may not understand the company's decision today."" In the following months, Axel Springer selectively disclosed the findings of the Freshfields investigation to employees and the public. One press release described ""mistakes""; another referred only to a single ""proven and admitted"" past relationship. But the Freshfields investigators had in fact concluded there was ""severe managerial misconduct"", as Reichelt had doled out favours to current or former lovers who were his subordinates, a person with first-hand knowledge of the matter told the FT. And the Axel Springer summary omitted Freshfields' finding that there had been several additional relationships that Reichelt had not admitted to, including one that was continuing. The report also referred to the unwanted ""romantic"" text messages. In a statement to the FT, Reichelt said: ""The accusations against me are false, the claims are lies. They were fabricated and orchestrated by an obsessed ex-girlfriend ... An extensive investigation found I did not break a single company rule, because I never did."" Reichelt was correct that the company rules at the time did not prohibit workplace affairs. An attempt by the company to require employees to disclose sexual relationships with colleagues was shot down by worker representatives some years back. Only after Reichelt's dismissal was the code of conduct updated to stipulate that ""close personal relationships with employees who report to them must be disclosed"". Women interviewed by Freshfields told the FT that they felt harassed, but the law firm concluded Reichelt's conduct did not meet the strict definition of harassment under German law the unwanted touching of ""another person in a sexual manner"". Nor did the hotel room sex constitute coercion, defined as exploiting ""a situation in which the victim is threatened with serious harm"" to perpetrate unwanted sexual acts. But the global #MeToo movement has deemed less serious misconduct to be career-ending. The compliance investigation made clear that Reichelt's relationships and actions, given his status, muddied the notion of mutual consent. ""I find both the term 'relationship' and the term 'consensual' completely absurd in relation to what Julian Reichelt did at Bild,"" said a former employee. ""What does a consensual relationship look like in this power imbalance?"" Leaked transcripts When Freshfields' transcripts of the woman summoned for the hotel rendezvous were leaked to the New York Times in October, the company responded that, ""at the request of witnesses, Axel Springer, too, had no knowledge of key interview transcripts"". Döpfner told employees and journalists: ""Knowing what we know now, we would do things differently."" He did not mention that Axel Springer's own compliance officer had heard this woman's story before the Freshfields probe even began or that, while the transcript of her testimony was not shared with Axel Springer, the company had received a summary. ""They knew it all from the beginning,"" a person directly involved in the investigation said. ""It was all so crazy, I felt like I was in some kind of Netflix drama.""    In the wake of the probe, Döpfner shared information with Reichelt. In a December interview, Reichelt even told the German newspaper Die Zeit that Döpfner read out the entirety of the Freshfields report. The written report was supposed to be closely guarded, with access requiring special log-in details from the law firm. Axel Springer said: ""Julian Reichelt was informed, including by some quotations, about the findings of the Freshfields report. He did not receive the report and it was not read to him."" The FT has reviewed evidence, however, that indicates Reichelt received updates during the investigation that enabled him to identify many witnesses. Two weeks after the events organiser met von Götz and Bayer at her home, the editor contacted the woman's mother. He made clear that he knew of the complaints, even though the woman had been given a written promise of confidentiality. ""I was promised I could trust these men,"" the ex-girlfriend told the FT through her lawyer. ""I feel like they put me in danger in order to defend Julian and themselves."" In early March, Bayer, the head of news, shared some details with Reichelt on the progress of the probe and mentioned that, by doing so, he endangered his own career, according to a person familiar with the matter and material reviewed by the FT. Some executives encouraged Reichelt by advising him he could deny everything, making the allegations difficult to prove. Others shared their assurances it would conclude in his favour. ""There was constant contact,"" a person familiar with the matter said. Axel Springer said: ""Throughout the process, Freshfields and the Axel Springer compliance team ... strictly adhered to the confidentiality requirements agreed with witnesses. Insights were shared only in abstract summary form and on a no-names basis."" US investors informed The presence of two of the most prominent North American investors as major shareholders might have been expected to produce a different outcome. Last week CNN's boss, Jeff Zucker, resigned after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a colleague. CPPIB's own former chief executive, Mark Wiseman, was ousted from his subsequent role at BlackRock in 2019 over a romantic affair with a colleague. But in the case of Axel Springer, senior executives at KKR and CPPIB enmeshed in the company's governance including KKR co-founder Henry Kravis were persuaded that Reichelt's behaviour did not constitute sackable misconduct. Another KKR partner who is not on the Axel Springer board weighed in: General David Petraeus, the former head of the CIA, who joined the private equity group in 2013. Reichelt knew Petraeus from his time covering the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, hailing him in one article as a ""legend on the battlefields of the 21st century"". At some point in late February or early March, Petraeus shared his views on the embattled editor with senior KKR executives in Europe. The exact nature of his intervention is unknown. Neither of the major investors provided direct answers to detailed lists of questions from the FT. ""We were sufficiently and well informed regarding the investigation,"" said CPPIB, which invests on behalf of 20mn Canadians and describes itself as an ""active and engaged owner"" when it comes to companies' ""ESG journeys"". KKR said it ""expects and encourages its portfolio companies to provide all employees with a working environment that is free from any form of harassment or discrimination"" and that it supported the Freshfields investigation. As for Freshfields, six months later, the firm secured a lucrative mandate representing Axel Springer on the Politico acquisition. Freshfields said future business with Axel Springer had no bearing on its handling of the Reichelt investigation. It told the FT that the probe was conducted ""in line with the highest professional and ethical standards, including, without limitation, a presumption of innocence, and at all times in full compliance with the firm's confidentiality obligations"".    Counter-investigation launched Two days after Reichelt's dismissal, Döpfner recorded a video to his staff that contained no sympathy for the victims. He spoke of ""men behind the scenes"" and told them an ex-girlfriend played a ""big role"" in the saga. In private, not long after the Freshfields investigation was completed, Döpfner had launched a counter-investigation intended to expose a ""conspiracy"" an expression he frequently used in text messages to executives. ""It's a blind hate agenda ... My feeling is we haven't looked at [the ex-girlfriend] in a while,"" Döpfner told senior employees in one conversation. Döpfner and his confidants hired an external lawyer and drew up a list of people to be investigated. ""When there is more media coverage of victims and so on then we should go after them [the authors of the alleged conspiracy]. We are not the bad guys who go into the private mistakes of innocent intellectuals. We are the last bastions of independence and government criticism and that is why we are being punished by the leftist bubble, which pursues its views with great intolerance,"" Döpfner said. Beyond the ex-girlfriend, some of the people whom Döpfner and his circle discussed looking into were former Bild editors and two German satirists who had publicly skewered Reichelt over affairs before the compliance case was made public. Another target was a former friend of Döpfner, the writer Benjamin von Stuckrad-Barre, who had publicly criticised Reichelt's politics and since 2020 urged him to investigate claims of misconduct against the editor. ""We should completely move this away from sexism ... It had nothing to do with MeToo,"" Döpfner continued. ""If we are attacked again ... we still cannot directly reveal the accusers, but it's acceptable to us that these names get out."" Before the New York Times article, Axel Springer threatened to issue a lawsuit against the woman whose transcript was obtained by the paper, accusing her of exposing the company's business secrets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Axel Springer said it had ""clear indications"" that third parties attempted to oust the editor and harm the company, ""including a list of persons named by Julian Reichelt"". The FT could not establish that any of the women who spoke out against Reichelt had specific political motivations or deliberately gave false testimony. All of them denied that their involvement was orchestrated by ""men behind the scenes"". ""The fact these Springer executives see this as a political conspiracy, driven by men, is the whole problem,"" said one woman who complained about Reichelt. Since Reichelt's removal, many of the women involved do not feel they have won their struggle. They argue the company has yet to apologise fully for what happened, and its own role. Döpfner told the FT that one case of misbehaviour should not colour the image of the whole company, which he said had been transformed from a maledominated publisher to an openminded, tolerant corporate leader in diversity and inclusion. ""It's tragic for one single case and one single asset to be portrayed as a structural problem ... and it's unfair to the nearly 17,000 employees,"" he said. While Döpfner continues to drive the digital revolution, Reichelt, whose Twitter bio states ""I'll be back"", is preparing to launch his own television station. ""It is just the same Axel Springer,"" a woman who testified to Freshfields told the FT. ""They're ignoring us, all over again.""

a25bb4803a23d3ec42cd,2022-02-07,Chief digs deep to change miner Rio's image,"Interview. Jakob Stausholm Tackling bullying, sexism and emissions as well as restarting stalled projects are priorities Jakob Stausholm has been in charge of Rio Tinto for a year and the scale of the task facing him is becoming clear. A company-commissioned report by former Australian sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick last week revealed shocking levels of bullying, discrimination and abuse at the 149-year-old mining group. More than a quarter of women surveyed said they had been sexually harassed and almost 40 per cent of men who identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander said they had experienced racism. ""I am really disturbed by the things we are learning about,"" Stausholm told the Financial Times. ""As management, we own the culture and when we know these things we have an obligation to address them."" By exposing the company's workplace failings, Stausholm hopes to bring about the change needed to create a less hierarchical and more open-minded Rio. ""If you want to be transparent inside the company it is probably the best thing to be transparent externally as well,"" said the 53-year-old Dane, who commissioned the report and has promised to implement all its 26 recommendations. A former Shell and AP Moller-Maersk executive, Stausholm was Rio's finance director for two years before becoming CEO in December 2020 in the wake of an international outcry over the company's destruction of an ancient Aboriginal site. The Juukan Gorge incident cost several executives their jobs, including Stausholm's predecessor Jean- Sébastien Jacques. The selection of an internal candidate with limited operational experience was not universally welcomed by shareholders. Nor was his first big investor presentation in October, when he set out plans to invest $7.5bn over the next nine years to halve the company's carbon emissions. But Stausholm, who likes to submerge himself in data and pore over reports, has started to win round investors and analysts. ""Shareholders seem to like him,"" said Richard Hatch, analyst at Berenberg. ""It was a bit of a surprise when he got the role but he's been very consistent on strategy, focusing on free cash flow, shareholder returns and, importantly post-Juukan Gorge, Rio's ESG [Environmental, Social, and Governance] credentials."" George Cheveley, portfolio manager at asset management company Ninety One, believes Stausholm was right to focus on culture. ""Everyone focused on the decarbonisation plan but the first half of the investor day was all about culture, people and organisation"", he said. ""But these things are actually crucial for Rio. He's trying to change the way Rio is run and makes decisions."" The workplace culture report came shortly after Stausholm had chalked up his first big win as boss of the $90bn company, when he detonated six tonnes of explosives in the Gobi desert to begin caving work at Rio's most important growth project. Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolian for Turquoise    Hill, will be one of the biggest copper mines in the world once it reaches full capacity from 2028, producing 500,000 tonnes a year of a crucial energy transition metal. Its $6.9bn underground expansion had almost come to a standstill because of bitter disputes over power, tax and who was to bear responsibility for the delays and cost overruns ? the budget has blown out from $5.3bn. Those disputes have been put to bed after Rio subsidiary Turquoise Hill Resources agreed to write off $2.4bn of debt Ulan Bator was supposed to pay back out of its share of the mine's profits. ""So what does this write-off really mean? It basically means the government will receive dividends earlier,"" said Stausholm. ""And if you are working with a partner or a co-owner that doesn't receive a dividend, it is very difficult to get that kind of mutual positive benefit."" He hopes the debt deal with Mongolia will send a message to Rio's partners in other parts of the world ? namely that mining, if done correctly, can bring ""mutual prosperity"". Oyu Tolgoi is one of four projects Rio needs to get back on track to tap rising demand for the commodities needed in a low-carbon economy and rev up its share price, which has flatlined over the past year. Its $2.4bn Jadar lithium project in Serbia was plunged into doubt last month after Belgrade revoked Rio's licences to mine and explore ahead of elections in April. In Africa, Stausholm says he is ""absolutely committed"" to developing Simandou, the Guinean iron ore deposit that is one of the great untapped prizes in mining. He visited the country in December to meet Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, the former French legionnaire who seized power in a military coup last year. ""We have a team on the ground. We are meeting regularly with the government and making progress. I think we are doing the right things,"" he said. However, he can point to fewer tangible signs of progress at Resolution, a giant underground copper mine in Arizona. It has been left in limbo after the Biden administration rescinded an environmental impact study that was needed to complete a land swap agreement. ""We are working toward progressing the project,"" he said. Advancing projects is not the only challenge. He also needs to improve operational performance, particularly that of Rio's Australian iron ore business, which has struggled to hit output targets and needs to complete several new mines to improve product quality. ""If you look at our operational performance we still have opportunities to do better,"" said Stausholm, who is under no illusions about the task ahead of him. ""There's plenty to do."""
4118d81b446cf44fbe89,2022-02-05,Ask those difficult questions about green investing,"INVESTING Successful investing requires the ability to spot and avoid fads that can create dangerous bubbles. Global equity markets tend to rise at a higher rate than inflation over time, but bursting bubbles cause sudden losses that may seriously undermine your long-term investment record. So patiently holding high-quality companies for the long haul and avoiding bubbles is a winning strategy. Some might argue that growing enthusiasm for sustainable investing is one of those dangerous fads. The criticism merits examination. When the Friends Provident Stewardship unit trust was launched in 1984 one wag dubbed it the ""Brazil fund"" not because it attempted to save the rainforest but because you would have to be nuts to invest in it. It was assumed that investing with sustainability in mind would impair returns. Today the reverse is claimed and perhaps too often. There are a number of difficult questions to address if you are approaching the 2022 Isa season with a serious commitment to investing sustainably and hoping to help the planet. Let's begin with returns. Will it make money? Last year's performance was poor at many companies you would expect to benefit most from a transition to a low-carbon world. Against a global equity index that rose 20 per cent in sterling, Orsted, the world's largest wind farm operator, fell 40 per cent in sterling. Shares in wind turbine maker Vestas fell 37 per cent. Meanwhile, First Solar fell 14 per cent and SolarEdge 9 per cent. Is this a sign that the boom in wind and solar power is not translating into value for shareholders? It may be just that these stocks were correcting a bubble deflating and a warning to keep an eye on valuations running ahead of reality. But large-scale government funding of wind and solar may have also played a part, fuelling competition, driving down renewable energy premiums and undermining future profit expectations. Just because a sector is growing is no guarantee that it will generate healthy returns. We all want a world that is safe to live in when we retire but we also need to be able to afford to live in it. You do not necessarily need to compromise your values to generate a return, but you may need to look more deeply for rewarding opportunities. How 'sustainable' is an investment? It is important to understand what we mean by ""environmentally sustainable"". It is not always as clear as it might seem, and politicians and policymakers are struggling to offer leadership on this. In Europe, for instance, each major country has taken a different route on energy policy over the past 50 years. The French get most of their energy from nuclear and note that this is lowcarbon, while Germany, which decided to turn off its nuclear reactors following the Fukushima accident in 2011, has a new coalition government, with    ministers from the Green Party concerned about nuclear waste. Italy has turned off nuclear power but, as a consequence, burns a lot of gas. A recent EU paper that described a mix of nuclear, gas and carbon capture as green was condemned by Ger- many's environment minister as ""absolutely wrong"". Regulators are waiting for governments to agree a taxonomy of sustainable activities so they can offer some guidance and parameters to the investment industry. However, with politicians still arguing, it may be a long wait. We might look to rating agencies for help instead but we should do so with a degree of scepticism. The underlying data, though improving, is often poor, and the methodologies of different agencies may surprise you if you examine them closely. You might have assumed, for instance, that environmental, social and governance scores produced by index provider MSCI incorporate some measure of how much impact a company has on the planet. However, a recent study by Bloomberg shows the scores actually measure the risk the planet poses to a company. This means, for example, that McDonald's which produced 54mn tons of emissions in 2019, an increase of 7 per cent in four years, according to Bloomberg enjoyed an upgrade from MSCI last year. This was on the grounds that climate change neither poses a risk nor offers opportunities to the fast-food chain; but the business did introduce recycling bins so that was a tick. What's the best way to change the world? The third question is perhaps the toughest. What should we invest in if we want the world to be a better place and our savings to contribute meaningfully towards positive change? Funds that rank highly on ESG scoring systems often do so by investing largely in technology stocks. These tend to have low emissions and often score well on other factors, but they may offer little to lead the world to a lower-carbon future and if you are building a portfolio of ""sustainable funds"" you should check that you haven't ended up with a very narrow focus on the same sectors and companies. The biggest change may come from companies with high emissions investing in technology to reduce them. Cement is responsible for about a quarter of all industrial emissions of carbon dioxide. HeidelbergCement Norcem is building the world's first large-scale cement plant to incorporate carbon capture technology. Located in Brevik, Norway, it should trap 400,000 tons of CO2 a year. It will cost £1.85bn over 10 years. Companies engaging in this sort of project need capital. The reduction in carbon emissions per dollar invested in improving a low-quality industrial plant may be much greater than that of finessing a more modern one. But adding to our portfolio a high-emitting company with bold plans to reduce emissions would probably lower our fund's overall environmental score. This presents a dilemma to me as a fund manager. Beyond incorporating general ESG factors into our investment decisions, my co-manager, Alex Illingworth, and I specifically avoid producers of fossil fuel and companies with high carbon emissions. We believe we are achieving a pragmatic balance reflecting the environmental concerns of our investors without constraining the investment universe so much that it hampers performance. But should we abandon these point-blank exclusion policies? I know it is easy for managers to use the excuse that they are investing in heavy emitters of carbon because you can make more change from within as an owner of a company. There is, however, some truth in that. As a birdwatcher, I need no convincing that global warming is real. The spoonbills wintering on the north Norfolk coast instead of migrating to southern Europe are evidence that the world is changing. Welcome as the spoonbills are, I would prefer to see environmental policies which allow traditional birds such as cuckoos and turtle doves to recover. Professional managers and DIY investors alike increasingly recognise that the best companies have effective policies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and that incorporating ESG considerations into investment decisions can help mitigate risk and enhance returns. It may even help save the planet. But not inevitably. Hopefully, this year we will see better data and a more coherent direction on plans for a lower-carbon world. Whatever happens, my own resolutions for the year are to retain a healthy scepticism, watch valuations, be discerning and keep asking myself awkward questions about how I approach investing. If I need a prompt as the year unfolds, I shall get out my binoculars and watch the spoonbills.

4ccf93afa5c2da19554b,2022-02-05,Merryn Somerset Webb Investing,"Growth potential in the natural capital of farmland I n July 2000 Country Life ran an editorial headlined ""What happens to the farmland that nobody wants?"" Farming, it said, was in crisis. Milk prices were so low that dairy herds were being dispersed and various experts predicted that ""within the next couple of years"" it was entirely possible that ""large areas of the familiar West Country landscape of hedgerows and small fields might be abandoned"". Oh, for a time machine. In 2000, the average price of an acre of prime arable land was around £3,000. By 2015 that had leapt to over £9,000. There was a post-Brexit wobble as the UK exited the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. But prices rose just over 6 per cent last year and are now back to near their £9,000-plus peaks. You can buy land for less, of course: Savills, the estate agent, still shows land classed as ""poor livestock"" priced at £4,000 an acre. The question is whether you should. The price of UK land has long been divorced from the yields you get from farming. It is as much a function of the subsidy regime and the ability to use it as a way of avoiding inheritance tax as anything else. Add an overlay of low interest rates; the wind and hydro booms; a fast-rising super-rich sector of the population mad for the status that comes with hobby farming (nothing says ""I'm rich"" in this decade more than saying ""I'm rewilding""); and the pandemic rush to the country and it is perfectly obvious that the price of barley makes no odds to the price of land. But this might be a new beginning for lucky landowners: there's a new and very deep-pocketed purchaser about the environmental buyer. There isn't a company left in the UK not under pressure to reduce its environmental impact and its path to net zero. Farmland is part of the answer. It is no longer about food production, Savills says. Instead thanks to the shift in global regulatory accountability for environmental impacts it ""presents a real asset opportunity that is high in ESG values"". Imagine you own a big office building. You want it to be a net zero. You mitigate what you can, with energy efficiency measures, insulation and so on. But you are always going to need carbon credits from somewhere. You could buy in those credits, as most do. But you could also, suggests Etienne Prongué of BNP Paribas Real Estate, build your own. Buy land. Plant trees. Have your own long-term carbon capture scheme and protect your building from any future rise in the price of carbon credits as well as (possibly) giving its price a ""green premium"" when you come to sell it. The same goes for pretty much any business looking to cut their net carbon footprint you can create credits or you can buy in. Tree planting is already popular. It is about as close to a mature sequestration market as we have at the moment.    But there are less obvious opportunities for landowners, too. There is peat restoration. Peatlands dried out to create grazing land can be restored (perhaps to offset the peat disrupted by the building of wind farms and the like). Farming methods can be changed. ""No till"" farming keeps carbon in the soil. Switching land from arable to grazing could create carbon negatives as well, since pasture-raised meat farming can be carbon neutral in itself. There is also potential in the more general development and protection of ""natural capital"" everything from water quality to biodiversity. One example: all UK developers now have to demonstrate that they create at least a 10 per cent ""net gain"" in biodiversity. That's not easy when you are cramming a pile of ugly, lowquality housing on to a series of minute footprints. So it needs to contract out to landowners who can deliver the goods off-site. All of this comes with endless regulatory novelty and uncertainty, to say nothing of land user conflicts. But two things are not so uncertain. The first is that one way or another the private sector is in the process of creating solutions to every regulatory demand. Look, for example, to BNP's ClimateSeed platform or EnTrade, a business based in the south-west, which connects businesses needing a little environmental do-goodery with farmers who can sell it to them. The second is that the emergence of these new income streams adds value to land and, given that the credits are all about change for the better, in particular to land previously considered poor. That's why the price of poor quality livestock land rose at more than double the rate of prime arable land last year. It's also why non-farming buyers took 38 per cent of land sales last year and why institutional and corporate buyers made up 16 per cent of land buyers. The 10-year average is 10 per cent. Everyone wants an ESG overlay on their investments these days. But the gravy train isn't delivering quite as it was. Last year saw ESG portfolios underperform oil and gas, for example, as the renewable bubble began to deflate and the exuberance disappeared from the low profit tech world. That doesn't look like a trend that is turning this year. Farmland offers an alternative for the environmentally minded. There isn't much of it. Everyone wants it needs it, even. So prices seem likely to rise even on the uninteresting land with no pretty houses on it that Country Life once worried about. But how do you get in? Here's the tricky bit. You can of course just buy land though this is not for everyone. There are also forestry funds you can look at. The recently listed Foresight Sustainable Forestry Company PLC is looking to buy lowquality grazing land in the UK with a view to both growing trees for timber and taking advantage of the emerging carbon/biodiversity market. Otherwise, there is the Standard Life Investments Property Income Trust. It's a perfectly good investment as a property income fund, but its manager also recently bought 1,447 hectares of upland rough grazing land in the Cairngorms. The plan is to reforest some, use some for peatland restoration and work on biodiversity on the rest. Very ESG. Just how the money will be made isn't completely clear, of course, and the land only makes up a tiny bit of the portfolio. But you have to like the way the trust is thinking.

24360faefe89fea175a3,2022-02-04,Smith's criticism of Unilever is easy sound bite,"Letters Terry Smith, one of Unilever's biggest shareholders, criticises the group for focusing on sustainability at the expense of business results, commenting that a ""company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann's mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot"". While it is an easy sound bite (""Top Unilever shareholder attacks failed GSK unit bid"", Report, January 21; and ""Unilever investors tell chief to hold the mayo"", Report, January 13), blaming purpose or the company's focus on environmental, social and governance issues gives a very a bad signal from a powerful investor and goes against the modern view of how to run a company. I led one of Unilever's categories in Brazil, one of its biggest markets. I know first-hand how its focus on purpose-led brands helped Unilever rejuvenate its portfolio and create ""brand love"", unlocking the magic of its brands and putting people first in its communication, activation and innovation. It is easy to forget that from 2010 to 2018 Unilever outperformed many of its competitors. In my current job as a consultant for many multinationals, I see how Unilever's focus on ESG and purpose is still an example in the business world. Many companies are fortunately also now thinking beyond just shareholder value. That Unilever needs to change is clear. Indeed, had Unilever lived up to its purpose-based strategy, Alan Jope, the chief executive, would never have had to make his dramatically failed bid for GSK's consumer health division. The issue is not the purpose of Hellmann's as such. The issue is the speed, agility and support of the brands to make purpose happen in execution. The world needs more purposebased strategies. Purpose and ESG need to be higher on the corporate agenda, not lower. Robert Schermers São Paulo, Brazil"
689c67bfe0cb4110c5f8,2022-02-04,The new front line in US-China cold war,"For the sponsors, the official opening of the winter Games should be a moment of excitement. Instead they are being accused of ignoring China's human rights record and the plight of the Uyghur Muslims. Chamath Palihapitiya, the Silicon Valley billionaire investor and part-owner of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, triggered a backlash when he said ""nobody cares"" about the Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang region. While his comments last month were slammed for being unusually callous, they were also rare in another sense. In the months leading up to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, which formally open today, companies have been keeping their heads down when asked about the persecution of more than 1mn Uyghur Muslims, which the Biden administration has called ""genocide"". None of the 13 members of the International Olympic Committee's top corporate sponsorship programme ? which includes Coca-Cola, Visa, Intel, Airbnb, P&G, Allianz and Toyota ? commented when asked how they viewed China's treatment of the Uyghurs. Mars Wrigley, the Snickers manufacturer that has a direct sponsorship deal with the Beijing Olympics, also declined to comment. Airbnb and P&G defended their participation, saying they were supporting athletes. Atos, the French IT company, said it enabled the Olympics regardless of location. On Capitol Hill, Democrat and Republican politicians are critical of US companies which they believe are caving in to Chinese pressure to maintain market access. ""It's disturbing that so many American companies are turning against American values to stay in the good graces of the Chinese Communist party,"" says Michael McCaul, the top Republican lawmaker on the House foreign affairs committee in Congress. ""Just look at the companies sponsoring the Olympics and refusing to speak up for human rights,"" he adds. ""We can't let these companies help cover up genocide and undermine national security."" US companies are caught in the crosshairs as Washington and Beijing engage in a cold war that is creating complex faultlines for corporate America to navigate. President Joe Biden ? whose administration is boycotting the Beijing Games ? has taken a tougher stance than many expected on China over everything from its repression of the Uyghurs to its crackdown on Hong Kong. He has also implemented measures that make it harder for Beijing to obtain sensitive US technologies such as semiconductors. His increasingly powerful Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, has shown no sign of responding to US demands over issues such as Taiwan, around which China is conducting military activity. While Beijing is also cracking down on foreign companies operating in China that criticise its human rights record. Intel is the latest multinational to face pressure. The semiconductor maker apologised to Chinese customers in December for saying that it could not source components from Xinjiang ? because of a new US law that requires companies to prove that imports from the northwestern Chinese region are not made with forced labour. In 2021, several multinationals, including Nike and H&M, removed language from their websites that expressed concern about forced labour in Xinjiang after Beijing orchestrated consumer boycotts to punish the apparel brands.    Multinationals are also facing more national security scrutiny. The US is paying more attention to exports to China and investments in the country, as the administration continues to add Chinese entities to export and investment-ban lists. At the same time, lawmakers are preparing to vote on a sprawling 2,912-page China-related bill, which includes a measure that would create a mechanism to screen US investment in China. The White House is also looking at the issue. Companies must also grapple with a 2021 law that allows Beijing to punish companies that facilitate the enforcement of US sanctions. Yet human rights groups say companies can no longer claim to be serious about environmental, social and corporate governance if they are silent on Xinjiang. ""No company can credibly claim to have an ESG or human rights policy when it remains silent in the face of the second most powerful government in the world committing crimes against humanity,"" says Sophie Richardson, head of China policy at Human Rights Watch. ""Either you're serious about these commitments or you're not,"" she adds. ""The Olympics is just another example of people clearly choosing to make money rather than figure out how to use their power to improve the situation."" 'Anti-aircraft flak' Some of the sponsors have been here before, having faced criticism over their involvement in the summer Olympics in Beijing in 2008. But the scope of the persecution in Xinjiang, where over 1mn Uyghurs have been detained in recent years, has intensified scrutiny. The economic stakes for companies are also higher now because the Chinese market is so much bigger. And companies also have to deal with consumers in both nations who have much more power because of social media. North Face was targeted by human rights activists in 2021 after it erased language about forced labour from its website. But, says Steve Rendle, chief executive of VF Corp, which owns the outdoor clothing brand, Xinjiang has also become a ""big driver of energy"" for Chinese consumers. Rising nationalism, expressed in how younger Chinese consumers use their purchasing power, is ""absolutely a consumer trend"", he says. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the House energy and commerce committee, says she and her colleagues want US companies to defend human rights and will continue to apply pressure. But, she says, US consumers will ultimately be the most powerful lever to change behaviour. ""It would be foolish for companies to ignore their American customers, who are appalled by China's human rights abuses and the genocide of Uyghur Muslims,"" McMorris Rodgers says. Top-tier Olympic sponsors buy exclusive rights to product and service categories such as soft drinks, IT or vehicles for contract periods of a minimum of four years. That ensures sponsors sign on for at least one summer and one winter Games in deals that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Ricardo Fort, a consultant who previously worked in global sponsorships at Coca-Cola and Visa, says the criticism of the Olympic sponsors is ""unfair"". He was working at Visa in 2015 when the IOC chose Beijing to host the 2022 Games. He says sponsors preferred China over Kazakhstan, the only other bidder, after several cities dropped out. After the success of the 2008 Games, businesses welcomed the chance to work with China again, says another former executive with experience in Olympic team sponsorships. Since the awarding of the 2022 Games, however, China has come under intense criticism for its policies in Xinjiang, prompting some companies to pare back their marketing plans, with many blaming the pandemic. Rick Burton, a sport management professor at Syracuse University who was chief marketing officer for the US Olympic Committee at the 2008 Games, says sponsors knew they would come under pressure ahead of the 2022 Games. But, he says, they are facing a perfect storm, as pandemic restrictions and a chockablock US sports calendar in February threaten to rob them of viewers, adding to the woes sparked by the intense focus on the Uyghurs' situation. ""They are ... trying to get through the anti-aircraft flak,"" says Burton. ""The sponsors are really just trying to hang on and get through these Games."" Fort says that even if all the sponsors took a public stand against China, it would have limited impact on the IOC. ""If you want to drive change, you've got to ask the broadcasters. They're responsible for 73 per cent of the    revenue."" Political scrutiny No company is more exposed over the Beijing Games than NBC, the US network that has dominated coverage of the Olympics for decades. In 2014 it renewed its Olympics deal, paying $7.75bn for the exclusive US broadcast rights to the Games from 2022-32, making it one of the main sources of revenue for the IOC. The close alignment of interests between NBC and the IOC ? the television network reported $1.8bn in revenue from the Tokyo Games despite poor viewing figures ? means they are frequently lumped together by critics of Olympic decision-making. Among those critical of the IOC's move to stage the Games in Beijing is Bob Costas, a longtime NBC presenter who was the face of its coverage for 12 Olympics. ""The IOC deserves all of the disdain and disgust that comes their way for going back to China,"" he told CNN in January. ""They're shameless about this stuff."" The IOC has also been pummeled over its handling of the case of Peng Shuai, the Chinese tennis star who was silenced on domestic social media after she alleged being sexually assaulted by a top Communist party official. The IOC said she was ""safe and well"" after holding two calls with the athlete, prompting human rights groups to accuse it of facilitating Chinese censorship. NBC has come under political scrutiny from US lawmakers who asked whether it had safeguards in place to ensure it did not use forced labour during the event. ""As NBCUniversal begins its coverage of the 2022 Winter Olympics, we believe viewers and listeners deserve to understand whether your programming has been influenced by the IOC or the Chinese Communist party,"" they wrote in a letter to the broadcaster. McMorris Rodgers and Bob Latta, an Ohio lawmaker, asked NBC how it planned to ""shed light on China's history of human rights abuses"" during the Games. NBC has said its coverage would ""provide perspective on China's place in the world and the geopolitical context"". But it emphasised that its Olympic broadcasts would be primarily focused on the athletes. The network isn't sending announcers to Beijing, citing Covid-19 concerns, so the commentary on events from figure skating to snowboarding will be made from Connecticut. But it said there would be NBC news reporters at all of the Olympic venues. Marketing executives say NBC is already looking beyond Beijing to the Paris Olympics in 2024, given the Coviddamped ratings in Tokyo last summer. By some measures Tokyo was the least watched Games on record, attracting an average 15.5mn viewers for peak-time broadcast in the US, its smallest audience since NBC began covering the summer games in 1988. ""It's going to be a more muted Olympics given the absence of fans, the inability to travel and the geopolitical context,"" says Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, a media investment company. ""Brands are not wanting to expose themselves to risks of association with problematic policies."" Athlete power One dilemma facing corporate sponsors is how to respond if athletes wearing their logos use the Olympics to send critical messages to Beijing. The consequences of angering China have already been made crystal clear. After Enes Kanter, a Boston Celtics basketball player, labelled Xi a ""brutal dictator"" on social media last year ? in a protest over the treatment of Tibet ? the club's games were stripped from the internet in China and state-run outlets stopped broadcasting them. Some prominent former competitors, including two-time US Olympic crosscountry skier Noah Hoffman, and human rights advocates have urged athletes competing in Beijing to stay silent during the Games for their own safety. IOC rules bar protests during medal ceremonies, in the middle of competition, or during the opening or closing ceremonies. Athletes can ""express their views"" in media interviews, press conferences, or on social media, but officials say US athletes have been reminded that they are subject to local laws. One Beijing 2022 official sparked concern by suggesting that athletes could be punished for voicing political views. While sponsors have kept quiet, some officials with western Olympic teams, including Germany, have said they will be supportive if any of their athletes draw attention to China's human rights. Some companies, such as Nike, have remained silent about human rights in China even as they promote social justice campaigns in the US, including one more recently linked to tennis champion Naomi Osaka. Nike also declined to comment about its stance on Xinjiang and how it would respond if any of its sponsored athletes protest in Beijing.    Jewher Ilham, a Uyghur activist whose father Ilham Tohti was jailed for life by China on separatism charges that were criticised as politically motivated, says Palihapitiya's comment sparked a deluge of support for Uyghurs around the world. But she says sponsors, such as Coca-Cola ? which has a bottling plant in Xinjiang ? have not learnt any lessons. The company declined to respond to Ilham's comment. ""Major corporations such as Coca-Cola sponsored the summer Olympics in Berlin in 1936, while fully aware of the conditions in the country, even if they did not foresee what was to come,"" says Ilham. ""Coca-Cola clearly did not learn from its past mistake when deciding to be a sponsor of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.""

992d0482a28ebd39883b,2022-02-03,Swedish ESG investors' disdain for defence leaves Latvia uneasy,"A rtis Pabriks is not one to mince words. With European military and security tensions at their highest in decades, Latvia's defence minister used an interview with the Financial Times to eviscerate Germany for its ""immoral and hypocritical"" relationship with Moscow, daring to say what many in eastern Europe feel. But the Latvian deputy prime minister also took aim at a more unusual target in the same interview: Swedish banks and investors. He told how he had seen an email months earlier from an unidentified Swedish bank Swedbank and SEB dominate Latvia's financial sector refusing to give a loan to a Latvian defence company due to ""ethical standards"". That follows a pattern of banks and investors, not just in Sweden but across Europe, refusing to back defence groups as it goes against their environmental, social and governance policies. Pabriks was apoplectic. ""I got so angry. How can we develop our country? Is national defence not ethical? How is the Swedish defence industry financed by Martians?"" he asked. Behind the outrage, Pabriks makes two big points worth pondering. As Russia amasses more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine and makes threats not just against the Baltic country but the entire European security architecture, how can banks and investors fail to support companies helping protect their countries? And is making your country's banking industry dependent on another country's lenders a wise thing? ESG lending and investing has taken hold in much of Europe and the US to a greater or lesser extent, but Sweden is one of the countries leading the way. The decision to blacklist certain companies or industries such as tobacco is pretty standard in many areas. But defence companies pose an especially tough dilemma for banks and investors. Norway's $1.3tn oil fund has long banned those companies active in making parts for nuclear weapons, leading it to exclude several big names such as Airbus, Boeing and Honeywell. 'I got so angry national defence ethical? How is Swedish defence financed by But others have gone further and de facto banned the entire sector, under pressure from some NGOs and customers who argue lethal weapons should play no part in society. There have also been worries about corruption in the sector. Sweden, long known for its neutrality, has for an equally long time made having a national defence industry a strategic value. Saab, which is listed in Stockholm, makes fighter jets, submarines, sensors and more for the military, both at home and abroad. Christian Luiga, Saab's chief financial officer, said companies such as his were being squeezed by investors, banks and suppliers over ESG concerns. He added that ""some Swedish funds were more hesitant in investing in Saab, because we're the only defence company on the Stockholm stock exchange"". Luiga and others are asking politicians to help classify defence companies as sustainable, as he argues many riskaverse financial institutions want official approval to support such groups.    SEB and Swedbank both said they recognised the defence industry was ""legitimate"" but added that they refused to back companies involved in ""controversial weapons"" such as nuclear or chemical, and that they acknowledged some customers had concerns about the entire sector. Swedbank added that in fund management it had a general rule allowing investment in defence companies, but that several of its funds banned such companies completely. Pabriks' second point on Swedish banks is also worth considering. The financial system of Latvia as well as Estonia and Lithuania suffered from corruption and nepotism in the 1990s so all three Baltic states turned to Nordic banks and particularly those from Sweden to reform their banking sector. The likes of SEB and Swedbank did so and together have a joint market share in Latvia in deposits of about 50 per cent, but there are growing worries in Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius that the current system is too dependent on one country and that if a problem affects Swedish banks such as plunging house prices in Stockholm or moneylaundering scandals then Baltic customers could be affected. ""We are dominated by Swedish banks. I don't think it's good. We need some other investors here to give some balance. They're not interested in helping our country, it's just about money,"" Pabriks added. It may well be another reason for countries to consider the need for strong national names in finance. richard.milne@ft.com 'I got so angry ... Is national defence not ethical? How is the Swedish defence industry financed by Martians?'"
985ff8d9f0e3f8f80b40,2022-02-03,Activists overhaul British boardrooms after snapping up corporate bargains,"From Vodafone to Unilever, investors are moving in on underperformers and pushing for change When Nick Read, Vodafone's boss, unveiled a plan to energise the struggling mobile group in November, investors welcomed it as a step in the right direction after a lacklustre few years. Little did they know that behind the scenes Vodafone was coming under pressure to improve its performance with the arrival of Cevian Capital in its shareholder base. Since buying a stake in Vodafone months earlier, Cevian, Europe's largest activist investor with about $15bn in assets under management, had been quietly engaging with management and the board. It urged them to be more aggressive in restructuring its portfolio and add telecoms expertise to its board. Whether Read telling investors of a renewed commitment to consolidation in Europe and willingness to offload businesses was a coincidence or shaped by the presence of Cevian, it is clear that activists are increasingly influential in top UK boardrooms. These investors, who buy shares in a public company with the aim of effecting change, are now on the shareholder register of at least nine companies in the FTSE 100. They are seeking to tap into shareholder discontent at the likes of Unilever and Vodafone following a period of underperformance, and are set to influence corporate Britain as never before. The biggest draw is the depressed price of UK-listed public companies since Brexit, with valuations that look cheap compared with other developed markets. ""The UK is a bargain basement right now, compared to the US, where there's too much money chasing too few deals,"" said Sarah Ketterer, chief executive of Causeway Capital Management, a $45bn asset manager in Los Angeles that is calling for a board refresh at Rolls-Royce. ""There's a confluence of undervalued companies and good corporate governance,"" she said. ""This means that with the right amount of persuasion, companies will do what they need to do to reward shareholders."" Few sectors remained untouched. Last month it emerged that Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners had built a stake in Unilever, the consumer goods company reeling from its aborted attempts to buy GlaxoSmithKline's consumer health division. GSK has been targeted by Elliott Advisors, which is pushing to overhaul the pharmaceuticals group's leadership. Elliott is also calling for a break-up of SSE, the power company, and a management overhaul at Taylor Wimpey, the housebuilder. Cevian also has a live campaign at Aviva, the insurer, and at Pearson, the education company. Elsewhere in the FTSE 100, Dan Loeb's Third Point is pushing to break up Royal Dutch Shell, the oil major. ""A common theme is that many of these cheap opportunities are large, long-term underperforming companies who have faced strategic crossroads,"" said Sue Noffke, head of UK equities at Schroders. Derided by some as aggressive shorttermists, the profile of activists and their specific investing strategies ranges from those who build a stake and immediately demand that capital is returned to investors, to those that seek to engage thoroughly with a company's leadership to improve its operations over time. Activists are not the only investors seizing on the perceived opportunity.    For the past 18 months, private equity firms have been snapping up publicly listed UK businesses at a record rate. Those deals included the £10bn purchase of Wm Morrison, the supermarket, in which CD&R, the buyout group, paid a 61 per cent premium to outbid a rival. But unlike buyout firms, which typically pay a premium to acquire assets, activists try to provoke change and boost returns in the public markets, without taking control of the company. The onslaught comes two years into the pandemic, which has transformed the corporate landscape. Trends such as environmental, social and governance considerations, working from home, supply chain disruption and technological innovation have exposed the gaps between corporate winners and losers. ""The type of company that is quite attractive to an activist is the bigger, conglomerate-like structure that has different business lines and geographies, which are core and non-core,"" said Tom Matthews, co-head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm White & Case. ""This means lots of opportunities to propose spin-offs"" of underperforming divisions, he said. Another dynamic favouring activists is a fragmented shareholder base in which domestic investors are typically perceived to place greater emphasis on receiving dividends than in other countries. That means management teams are often more conservative in the way a company is run. Unlike countries such as France and Italy, UK companies ""generally don't have large state or family holdings"" with privileges that can come at the expense of minority shareholders, said Andrew Millington, head of UK equities at Abrdn, which manages £532bn. ""This means that as a minority shareholder, if you can make your case and get other institutional shareholders on side, you can have influence and effect change."" Others point to implications of the rise of passive players such as Black- Rock, Vanguard and State Street, which by virtue of their vast exchanged traded fund businesses that track indices, hold big stakes in most large companies around the world resulting in the phenomenon of ""ownerless corporations"". For example, Vodafone's top three investors are passive players. ""The shareholder bases, especially for the large UK companies, are very fragmented,"" said Harlan Zimmerman, senior partner at Cevian. ""With the growth of passive investment, the big passive managers increasingly occupy the top slots of the registers. They own thousands of companies and generally do a very good job in advancing policies and dealing with crisis situations, but they really have to pick their battles to engage on issues of strategy and underperformance versus potential."" In December, Alvarez & Marsal, the professional services business, identified 148 European companies as potential targets for activist investors in the next 12 months. It found the UK was the most attractive for activists, with 36 per cent of the European companies identified as ""at risk"" based in the UK and a growing focus on ESG performance increasingly driving campaigns. Typically, these involve pressing a company to split its ""good"" and ""bad"" assets. For example, Third Point's campaign at Shell, which follows a successful activist campaign run by Engine No 1, a hedge fund, against its ExxonMobil, is urging the oil major to divide into a legacy business that could handle fossil fuels and a separate entity focused on cleaner energy. It is a similar story at SSE, where Elliott wants it to split the electricity networks and renewables divisions into two listed companies. Analysts said activists had adapted their methods to the UK market. Gone are the days of the US-style corporate raid, characterised by ""making highprofile unexpected announcements demanding companies get broken up, that divisions get sold and that management teams are changed,"" said Mark Kelly, a managing director at Cowen. Activists had become ""much more savvy in the way they deliver their message"", he said, particularly in their efforts to win over active shareholders. They are fully aware, he added, that ""in the UK in particular, without longerterm investors fully buying into the activist campaign, the strategy faces little chance of success"".

41479ba584ff1d24ecce,2022-02-03,'Right to repair' campaign is forcing a rethink by Big Tech,"Growing up in 1970s Britain, I would gaze in awe at my great aunt Ruth Tett's kitchen cupboards. After living through two world wars and a global economic depression, she was addicted to hoarding and recycling almost anything she possessed. No old paper bags, bits of string, ribbon and wood, nails or pieces of cloth were ever thrown away if they could be repurposed in some form as clothes, fencing, or anything else. As a teenager, I described this as ""being old fashioned."" Today, I would say: ""embracing the circular economy"". The instincts that my great aunt upheld as a result of deprivations are coming back into vogue. That is partly because a new wave of environmental activists and sustainability champions are promoting ""circular economy"" goals or consumption based on the reuse of products, byproducts and waste, rather than a never-ending cycle of resource exploitation. The phrase ""circular economy"" is also being tossed around in the environmental, social and governance movement, with ESG investors pressing big companies to show how they uphold this mantra, too. The ideas represented in those 1970s kitchen cupboards, in other words, are creeping into the corporate boardroom. Consider the ""right to repair"" movement. A decade ago, it was taken for granted in Silicon Valley that consumers would always embrace the most up-to-date versions of digital devices. They would buy upgraded gadgets when their current ones malfunctioned or wore out. This upgrade culture was so ingrained in western consumer society that tech companies tended to design products on the assumption that they would quickly become obsolete. They used overt and covert strategies to prompt consumers to keep churning their devices. In 2020, for instance, Apple agreed to pay $500mn to settle claims that it deliberately slowed down some iPhones as they got older. No longer. These days, the cost of this upgrade mentality is becoming clear: Global E-waste Statistics Partnership, which measures electric and electronic waste, estimates that some 53.6mn tonnes of products were discarded in 2019, or 21 per cent more than five years earlier. Less than 20 per cent of this e-waste was officially recorded as recycled. But, now, a host of initiatives is under way to try to change consumer and corporate behaviour. University College London's Big Repair Project is a case in point. It has been carrying out surveys of the British public about their attitude towards their consumer electronics. As its website explains, the aim of the project is to ""understand the factors affecting household maintenance and repair (carried out yourself or using professional services) of home appliances and electronics across the UK"". The group recently met tech ""manufacturers, the repair community, industry bodies and other stakeholders"" to develop proposals for ""right to repair"" legislation in the UK. This would give consumers the ability to force companies to back efforts to reuse old electronic devices.    Separately, ESG activists have filed shareholder proposals at the annual meetings of big tech groups, seeking to force them to change their strategies. Last year, non-profit As You Sow unveiled a petition at Microsoft's AGM that called for its devices to be made more easily repairable. ""Microsoft ... facilitates premature landfilling of its devices by restricting consumer access to device reparability,"" Kelly McBee, waste programme co-ordinator at As You Sow, told the Financial Times. The move marked the first such shareholder proposal in the US. And, while tech leaders initially dismissed these ideas, Apple's management performed a U-turn late last year to launch a self-service repair scheme that would allow customers to buy Apple-made components to replace worn out or broken parts. Microsoft has made similar moves and other tech giants are likely to do the same not least because the Biden administration said last year that it wanted the Federal Trade Commission, the competition watchdog, to look at anti-competitive restrictions on repair markets. Around half of US states are contemplating local legislation in this direction, too. Of course, it remains to be seen how many consumers will fall in with the upgrade culture. After all, fixing an old iPhone or digital watch is no simple matter, even when parts are available. However, environmental activists hope these measures will encourage more independent repair providers to emerge. And, if nothing else, the about-turn by Apple illustrates two important points. The first is the degree to which big companies are responsive to ESG investor demands particularly when coupled with regulatory reforms. The second noteworthy lesson is how consumer expectations are changing. Generation X (like me) grew up revering the endless upgrades culture; today's millennial and younger generations are leaping back into the future. If my great aunt were still alive, she might chuckle; the rest of us should cheer. It was taken for granted in Silicon Valley that consumers would always buy upgraded gadgets"

The message by Wöhrmann, then Deutsche Bank's most senior retail banker in Germany and now chief executive of DWS, the country's top asset manager, has come back to haunt him as a scandal grows over his use of private messages for business purposes. Two days before the 56-year-old announced record DWS results for 2021 and gave an upbeat outlook, the Financial Times reported that Wöhrmann had used his personal email extensively for work messages. The FT also uncovered a payment of €160,000 to Wöhrmann from a Deutsche Bank client who took part in the Auto1 Fintech talks, later explained by both as part of a failed attempt to buy a Porsche. The matter escalated quickly. Deutsche Bank widened an internal investigation, as the use of use of personal email is strictly forbidden at the lender. The ECB was looking into governance issues around Wöhrmann, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. A former DWS executive has flagged the alleged extensive use of WhatsApp by Wöhrmann and other DWS executives in a whistleblower complaint to Germany's financial watchdog BaFin. The ECB and BaFin declined to comment. It comes on top of probes by US law enforcement and BaFin into alleged greenwashing flagged last year by DWS's fired ESG chief, Desiree Fixler. A Frankfurt employment court on Monday dismissed Fixler's unfair dismissal lawsuit. Wöhrmann, who declined to comment, appears to be taking things in his stride. ""Sideline noise will not keep us from doing what we have to do to stay successful,"" he told analysts last week. He hailed ""new records for net inflows, revenues and profit"". Following the FT report, DWS told other media that Wöhrmann had in recent months been the target of a ""malicious campaign"" in which ""misleading and selective"" information was leaked to ""attack and badmouth him"". The company, which has €928bn in assets under management, said Wöhrmann had also been sent racist and threatening letters, including one in December containing white powder that forced the evacuation of DWS headquarters in Frankfurt. ""I will not be intimidated,"" Wöhrmann told analysts. ""And I will not be deterred from my job."" Born in Sri Lanka in 1965, Wöhrmann moved to Germany aged 11 and grew up in a German family, who adopted him.    A trained economist, he joined DWS as a portfolio manager in 1998 after completing his PhD. He became a specialist on Japan as it reeled from the fallout of a burst property bubble, joking that he was ""assigned those tasks that nobody else wanted to do"".

In 2015 he briefly left to take charge of Deutsche Bank's German retail banking business, where he closed down one in four branches, including the one where his boss, Christian Sewing, had started as a trainee. ""I hope you will forgive me for this,"" he told his boss at the time. When Wöhrmann returned to DWS in November 2018 to replace hapless predecessor Nicolas Moreau, staff in Frankfurt were enthusiastic, bursting into applause before Wöhrmann had said a word at his first town hall meeting. ""He is doing this job with a lot of enthusiasm and authenticity, and is able to inspire our staff,"" Said Zanjani, head of the group's workers' council, said.

DWS shares are up 47 per cent since he took the helm, compared with a 35 per cent rise at majority owner Deutsche Bank and despite the US greenwashing investigation that wiped out €1bn in market capitalisation. In an early coup, Wöhrmann persuaded Tim Albrecht, a star fund manager who had been appointed to a top role at private bank Berenberg, to stay with DWS. The new chief executive embarked on radical cost-cutting and sacked about 50 managing directors, declaring that ""the stairs are being swept from the top"". Daring to oust managementlevel staff ""did win him the respect of many rank-and-file employees"", Zanjani said. Some senior staff who left DWS have a less benign view, describing Wöhrmann as vain, quick-tempered and Machiavellian, and saying he surrounded himself with yes-men. ""Loyalty is more important than quality,"" one former colleague said. Wöhrmann's record is not unblemished. An attempt to merge with the asset management arm of UBS failed in 2019. A punt by Albrecht on Wirecard cost DWS €600m when the payments group went bust. For now, Sewing stands by the boss of a crucial division that ties up little equity and generates stable earnings.

The costs of a successful drive to limit global warming to 1.5C would lower world GDP in 2050 by about 2 per cent, writes Wood Mackenzie in the report entitled ""No pain, no gain"". The forecast contrasts with the usual upbeat message from financiers and investors which often focuses on the opportunities in green energy. Peter Martin, head of economics at Wood Mackenzie, warns that a rapid energy transition is essential to prevent catastrophic climate change but the cost won't be felt evenly across regions. The effects are particularly stark in less-developed countries in Asia. China alone would absorb 27 per cent of the $75tn hit to global GDP, lowering its GDP by 2.8 per cent in 2050. India and Indonesia would lose 2.5 per cent and 2.2 per cent of their GDP, respectively, the report said. More mature economies in the region will feel less pain from the transition. Japan would suffer a smaller GDP hit of 1.5 per cent, with South Korea's figure estimated at 1.6 per cent. The estimates are measured against a basecase scenario, where global temperatures rise to 2.7C by 2050. Factors such as job losses, missed tax revenues from the carbon-intensive sectors, and initial inefficiency of new technologies will contribute to the decreased GDP figures. The costs will be highest for big oil exporters. The estimated GDP loss of the Middle East is more than 4 per cent. Iraq, the most vulnerable nation, could lose 10 per cent of its GDP. Over time, the economic benefits of the energy transition will pay off, Wood Mackenzie says, with the ""energy transition"" economic pathway overtaking the ""business as usual"" one though the speed will vary greatly between nations. While Europe could recoup its costs around 2075-80, China is not likely to do so before the end of the century, Martin says. The report is a stark reminder that the energy transition will come at a large cost in the next decades for some countries. Martin urged policymakers to ""consider how to minimise the economic impact of transition and spread the cost evenly"", as they seek to avoid the still greater economic damage that would ultimately be caused by catastrophic global warming. ESG ETFs' cumulative inflows exceeded the projected levels of $121bn in 2021 and may surpass $41tn in assets in 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. ""ESG has grabbed over 10 per cent of the global ETF flows in 2021. Though Europe dominated ESG ETFs so far, the US has led the wave of expansion,"" said Adeline Diab, director of research ESG and thematic investing.    The rapid growth of sustainable investing shows no signs of slowing. But regulatory measures for the mostly ungoverned sector, which are set to be rolled out this year, could introduce fresh challenges, experts warn. The issuance of sustainability-linked bonds and loans as well as green bonds, which have emerged as a new asset class, are projected to help spur another wave of ESG investment in the coming year.

fa82a4c9f18db6426d00,2022-01-26,Hedge fund short sellers target green energy stocks,"Equities. Sustainability Doubters increase their bets against businesses that rode the wave of ethical investing Hedge funds have been cranking up their bets against sustainable energy stocks, wagering that as interest rates rise, investors will be less forgiving of companies with strong environmental credentials but weak earnings. Shares in sustainable stocks have drawn in billions of dollars of inflows from ethically minded investors in recent years, lifting the valuations of some stocks to eye-watering levels. Some of those stocks have begun to fall back already as the US Federal Reserve prepares to withdraw pandemic-era support, a process that is pulling down many high-growth assets, especially in the tech sector. Doubters say green stocks have much further to fall. ""In a bear market, a company doesn't trade at 60 times earnings just because it does something morally good,"" said Barry Norris, chief investment officer at Argonaut Capital. ""People will be a bit more hard-nosed about it."" Norris is shorting a number of wind power stocks and has recently increased his bet against Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems. In November the company warned of an ""increasingly challenging global business environment for renewables"", citing global supply chain problems and higher costs. The company's shares soared from DKr130 at the start of 2020 to peak above DKr300 a year ago, although they have fallen back to around DKr170. But Norris believes the company, whose margins are contracting, is now ""the most expensive it has ever been"". Germany's Nordex has also been targeted by short sellers, with bets against the wind turbine manufacturer soaring from 0.79 per cent of the company's shares a year ago to more than 7 per cent, according to data group Breakout Point. That makes it one of Europe's most shorted stocks based on disclosed short positions. Among hedge funds betting against it are $52bn-in-assets Millennium Management, AKO Capital and Gladstone Capital. It is a risky strategy. Government-supported efforts to shift the global energy reliance away from fossil fuels point to heavy demand for companies in the sector. One executive told the FT their fund ""won't touch"" bets against such stocks, because of the increasingly favourable regulations and weight of money pouring into the sector. But hedge funds in the US and UK have been buying the lowly valued shares of oil and gas companies discarded by investors focused on environmental, social and governance factors, known as ESG. Betting against companies whose stories of helping the environment are stronger than earnings, or against those that have exaggerated their ethical credentials, has also become attractive.    The prospect of four rises in US interest rates this year is also now providing a challenge for lossmaking green stocks. Higher interest rates means higher borrowing costs for companies and a lower value ascribed to future cash flows. Funds have targeted hydrogen stocks, with disclosed bets against Norwegian hydrogen technology firm Nel, which reported a loss of NKr1.4bn in the first nine months of last year, jumping from 1.8 per cent a year ago to 7.8 per cent, according to Breakout Point. Helikon Investments, Crispin Odey's Odey Asset Management and WorldQuant have short positions against Nel, whose shares have risen from NKr5 three years ago to more than NKr35 a year ago but have since dropped to around NKr11. ""There is no obvious valuation support with Nel,"" said James Hanbury, a partner who manages around $1.3bn in assets at Odey, in a note to investors seen by the Financial Times. The company was ""lossmaking, cash consumptive, they continue to fail to win material contracts or partnerships, their medium-term capex needs are not fully funded and, on top of this, the [Odey] team perceive the business to be a commoditised technology offering,"" he said. Odey declined to comment. A spokesman for Nel said the company was ""the technology and market share leader in an industry that is at the beginning of significant growth and industrialisation"", adding that its investment was ""backed by a robust financial position"". Hedge funds have also increased their bets against France's McPhy Energy from 0.5 per cent a year ago to 5.5 per cent and against Norwegian plastic recycling technology company Quantafuel from zero a year ago to 4.3 per cent. ""We think the end game this year will be to short the Ark-type of stocks in solar [and] hydrogen,"" said Renaud Saleur, a former trader at Soros Fund Management who now heads Anaconda Invest. He is short hydrogen firms ITM Power and McPhy and solar technology company Enphase Energy. Some managers have even risked bets against electric vehicle stocks, one of the most volatile corners of the market. Norris has put on a short position against Tesla in recent days and is also betting against Rivian. He said the company, whose investors include Amazon and Daniel Loeb's Third Point, was on a ""ridiculous valuation"" and lacked firstmover advantage in the sector. ""My view is that we're going into a bear market and we're past the point of peak speculation,"" he said. ""This is exactly the sort of stock you don't want to own.""

efbdde617390a7438fda,2022-01-25,It's for companies to take initiative on social goals,"Letters In her article ""Big business should do more on the 'social' in ESG""(Opinion, January 14) Helen Thomas is right to suggest that the ""social"" in ESG gets overlooked. However, this is not necessarily because businesses don't know their people. Most large organisations conduct regular employee surveys and exit interviews to gain insight into staff perspectives. The difficulty with reporting on the ""S"" in ESG has more to do with the sheer breadth of what this needs to cover and how best to report on it. In assessing their social impact, businesses also need to evaluate a range of issues including worker welfare, bullying and harassment, diversity, equity and inclusion, the identification and prevention of human rights abuses and community impacts. In addition, they also need to understand the link between these social factors and issues such as corruption, coercive practices, the management of data protection and how these are governed by the organisation. Companies can do this by identifying the material issues specific to their business and developing a tailored road map with clear metrics for measurement and reporting. Investors can help by making it clear what they want to know. But in the absence of any direction from the investor community, companies should take the initiative and identify the social principles by which they operate, the goals set and the improvements being made. In doing so, they will put themselves in the best position to take advantage of the growing ESG funds available, and build the trust of their key stakeholders, not least their employees.

0ac58c238d14caa2bd08,2022-01-25,Eni/Var Energi: shelf assured,"Twitter: @FTLex The Italian energy group has confirmed plans to list Vaar Energi, its Norwegian subsidiary. The exploration company is one of the largest foreign-owned producers in Norway. The listing could raise $1.8bn for Eni, depending on demand. Eni has plenty of free cash flow, so most of the proceeds should go to shareholders. Try as it might to talk itself up, Eni's low stock market valuation shows that the Italian energy giant is given less respect than peers. Imminent spinouts of its renewables unit and now its Norwegian subsidiary could change that. Yesterday, Eni fired the starting gun for the initial public offering of Var Energi, of which it owns nearly 70 per cent. The business is active on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The region has had plenty of admirers in recent years, in contrast to the out-offavour UK North Sea. Valuations have weakened of late. But Var should still be worth about $13bn, say analysts at Société Générale. Norway is responsible for well over half of Europe's oil production and reserves. BP, Equinor and Lundin Energy have all been active there. Last month, Oslo-listed Aker BP gobbled up Sweden's Lundin, whose main operations are on the NCS, for $13.9bn in shares and cash. With Brent oil at five-year highs of $87 a barrel, who can blame Eni and buyout partner HitecVision for raising a sale sign? Even considering the oil and gas output from the enlarged Aker BP, Var would be the second largest of foreignowned exploration groups in Norway. The owners will sell only part of this relatively mature business. Assuming a fifth goes to new shareholders, one can assume that Eni's slice might be worth $1.8bn. That would come on top of Eni's estimated free cash flow of $5.5bn this year. Plenitude, the renewable energy unit, is tentatively valued at $10bn. Eni should get plenty of extra distributable cash from those three sources. The dividend yield on Eni shares is already a healthy 5 per cent. But the stock is languishing, even though plans to spin off Plenitude and Var have been well trailed. Eni trades on an enterprise value of 3.4 times its forecast ebitda, about a tenth below peers such as Total, BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Eni is relatively undervalued on a medium-term perspective. Investors not prohibited by ESG rules from venturing into wicked hydrocarbons could do worse than hold its shares.

3bb8e310c4224ad4596e,2022-01-24,Business schools find sustainability is hard to teach,"Integration into curricula of the values and skills associated with ESG has so far been a challenge, writes Andrew Jack D uring the first year of their MBA at the University of Pretoria's Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) in South Africa, students are required to work with local nonprofit organisations on community projects that tackle social problems. ""In the past, our focus was on driving competitiveness. Now it's about responsible management education,"" says Morris Mthombeni, interim dean at the school. ""The mining, manufacturing and financial services companies look to us to produce people with the language, aptitudes and trade-offs you have to make between the future and the present."" In recent years, attention in business schools about environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues has surged. This has reflected shifting attitudes among students, faculty and employers who have moved beyond a traditional focus on maximising financial returns for shareholders towards benefiting a wider range of stakeholders. GIBS, for example, is one of more than 800 schools to sign up to the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME). This initiative, supported by the UN, aims to promote the teaching of sustainability in business and management schools so that graduates have the skills to balance economic growth with wider objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate change. But despite the increased attention, academic leaders face tough challenges including how to define and prioritise the skills and values associated with ESG; how to integrate them into teaching, research and operations; and how far a failure to do so will undermine the future of business education. Responsible business is now a central concern for deans, according to Mette Morsing, head of PRME and a professor at Copenhagen Business School and the Stockholm School of Economics. ""Twenty years ago, I was told it was just a fad that would go away. Today demand has gone from the periphery to the mainstream,"" she says. ESG considerations have long been important for business schools in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, reflecting their egalitarian traditions and environmental priorities. But now, many institutions have launched electives, integrated ESG issues into their core courses, opened specialist research centres and even established standalone management masters' programmes on topics such as sustainability and the circular economy. Much of the current momentum has been driven by a questioning of capitalism linked to inequality and globalisation after the 2008 financial crisis, growing evidence of human-driven climate change and a reflection on purpose, highlighted by the Great Resignation during the Covid-19 pandemic. Business schools are now beginning to take collective action. At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last November, eight of the leading and normally fiercely competitive European institutions joined forces to launch    Business Schools for Climate Leadership. The aim is to promote more joint research on climate change, improve teaching and boost outreach to staff, students and alumni. Networks of academics are mobilising, for example establishing communities around responsible business research and impact investing and sustainable finance teaching. Accreditation frameworks including Equis, AACSB and AMBA have standards around the societal impact of business schools. Meanwhile, students are demanding change and fast. ""A majority of the schools still are lacking a lot of movement,"" says Sophie Charrois, president of Oikos International, a network of student groups seeking to transform economics and management teaching. ""We need to incorporate sustainability in a more holistic way."" Companies are also keen for responsible business to be taught if only to recruit the new talent. Robert Strand, executive director of the Center for Responsible Business at Berkeley's Haas business school, has observed growing calls by employers for skills such as analysis of ESG factors. Business schools are trying to adapt and appeal to students' and recruiters' demands to embrace social values, argues Jaime Bettcher, programme manager for the Aspen Institute's Business & Society Program, citing a surge in applications for its ""ideas worth teaching"" awards as evidence of their efforts. Yet there is disagreement about what constitutes responsible business education. ""The words ESG mean different things to different groups. We have to understand how to measure it and hold people accountable,"" argues Professor Glenn Hubbard, former dean of Columbia Business School. Colin Mayer, a professor of management who leads the British Academy's Future of the Corporation inquiry, argues for more purposeful business that finds profitable solutions for people and planet. But Aneel Karnani, professor of strategy at Michigan's Ross School of Business, dismisses as ""politically correct"" the declarations by deans of the centrality of social purpose in their curricula. ""Business schools are not going to make the world a better place but should help business do better,"" he says. Even for those who are more favourable to the new focus on responsibility, there remains strong disagreement about how it is taught and what knowledge will be displaced students need to find jobs in a world that, in places, remains ambivalent to ESG. ""The biggest issue is that we do not have a consistent and coherent framework that people can easily adapt to build sustainability into their operations strategy,"" says Professor Ilian Mihov, dean of Insead. ""There is not enough research, not enough tools."" Nevertheless, he has integrated the topics into courses and encouraged research to balance traditional business skills and the newer themes. ""We have to do both: to figure out how to integrate the sustainability mindset into a curriculum while we teach net present value, your standard balance sheet items or supply and demand."" Indeed, a pragmatic approach is the best way forward, argues Mthombeni of GIBS. ""We believe firmly in the principles of competition, but responsible competition. You have to compete vigorously, honestly and responsibly for the best ideas to thrive or you are diminishing the benefits of innovation."" The 'faculty at most American business schools ... need to catch up'"
7f5f436c91ab3d9c80dc,2022-01-22,Traders on 'high alert' after oil hits seven-year peak,"Commodities. Patchy production Goldman Sachs expects Brent crude to reach $100 a barrel in the third quarter of 2022 Oil has rallied strongly in early 2022, surpassing a seven-year high this week as traders rushed to lock in supply on expectations of resurgent demand, patchy production and an unstable geopolitical landscape. Brent the international crude oil benchmark traded above $87 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since 2014, rising as high as $89.50 on Thursday before trimming some of its gains. ""People are just on high alert,"" said Amrita Sen at consultancy Energy Aspects. ""Anything that could remotely impact supply to downside or demand to the upside, the market is reacting."" The initial uptick came after Yemeni rebels claimed responsibility for a drone attack in the United Arab Emirates. The incident had no effect on oil output but appeared to spook traders. Prices increased again after an explosion in Turkey briefly halted exports along a pipeline from Iraq's Kurdish region. The febrile atmosphere has been stoked by the possibility of the US imposing sanctions on Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine. Brent futures have already added about 12 per cent in January after an ascent of 50 per cent last year as fears fade about the Omicron coronavirus variant significantly slowing down the global economic recovery. Some analysts are predicting that oil could surpass the $100 mark this year. Such a scenario would add fresh fuel to already rapid global inflation. US bank Goldman Sachs said this week that it expected Brent to reach $100 a barrel in the third quarter and to average $96 a barrel in 2022, rising to $105 in 2023. Energy Aspects is forecasting average prices of $85 a barrel in 2022, but $112 in 2023. Oil's price surge has been underpinned by a view among some industry analysts that supply will tighten as the worldwide economy continues to rebound, leaving limited spare capacity to meet any future shortfall. Opec, led by Saudi Arabia and its allies, have committed to replacing the output that it cut at the start of the pandemic by a combined 400,000 barrels a day every month throughout 2022. But since that producer group agreement was reached in July, few countries other than Saudi Arabia and the UAE have managed to hit their contribution to the monthly uplift consistently. In December, Opec+, which includes Russia, increased output by only 250,000 b/d, according to the International Energy Agency, after Nigeria, Angola and Malaysia all underproduced. Russia also pumped less than its quota for the first time since the 2020 cuts were introduced. December's shortfall means that the group is producing 790,000 b/d less than it planned to at this stage, the IEA said in its latest monthly oil report released this week.    The US and other large oil consumers have repeatedly called on the Opec+ group to boost supply faster. But even if they agreed to lift the monthly target, technical and operational issues in several countries mean that the group would probably continue to fall short. ""In reality, Opec+ don't have the spare capacity that they claim to have on paper,"" said Sen. With global demand expected to return to pre-pandemic levels of approximately 100m b/d in 2022, there are questions about the availability of spare capacity to cover any operational or geopolitical disruption to current supply levels. Historically, economists and policymakers have argued in favour of maintaining spare capacity often defined as additional production that can be brought online in 30 days and sustained for 90 days of approximately 5 per cent of global oil supply, to avoid price volatility. Current estimates of the amount of additional production available vary. The IEA forecasts that spare capacity could shrink from about 5m b/d to below 3m b/d by the second half of the year with most of that held in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Goldman Sachs forecasts that it will fall further, predicting that Opec+ spare capacity will reach ""historically low levels this summer"" of about 1.2m b/d. Spare capacity is of particular concern because global oil inventories have fallen well below pre-pandemic levels after the US, Europe and Japan made large draws on their stocks. Across OECD countries, inventory levels are at their lowest level since 2000, according to Goldman Sachs. ""It is quite rational to assume that there could be a disruption of 1m b/d,"" said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research at the US investment bank. ""That's at least half of your sparecapacity so then you really have zero buffer left."" Some analysts are less worried. ""It's perceptions of capacity constraints [but] we don't actually think there are capacity constraints,"" said Paul Horsnell, commodities strategist at Standard Chartered, adding that he believed there was sufficient spare capacity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the UAE to cover most scenarios this year. Standard Chartered is predicting a supply crunch, driven by rising demand and insufficient production growth particularly outside Opec but not until 2024. It has forecast average prices for Brent of $75 a barrel in 2022 and $77 in 2023. Sen also expected a supply crunch in 2024 but said that it had already started. ""We've been talking about a supply crunch from 2022 to 2025 for some time now,"" she said. ""It's a function of the lack of spare capacity and lack of investment that has been made worse by Covid because demand has recovered quicker in some ways."" During previous commodity cycles, today's high prices would have resulted in investment that would boost supply and rebalance the market. But pressure to reduce dependence on oil and gas is limiting such spending, particularly at the publicly listed supermajors. ""Even at these prices, which are giving such high returns, [companies] are effectively prioritising ESG [environmental, social and governance],"" said Sen. ""If investment doesn't go up now, it never will."" 'We've been talking about a supply crunch from 2022 to 2025 for some time'"
ab47100e4e836b3c80a6,2022-01-22,"Before you scoff at cryptos, what's in your portfolio?","Merryn Somerset Webb Investing C ryptocurrencies are popular. If you aren't a curmudgeonly old fuddy duddy you probably own a lot by now. Even I, as curmudgeonly as anyone, own a few. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority put the number of people in the UK owning crypto at around 2.3m, and it makes sense to think that number is already rather higher. Several surveys back that up. Interactive Investor research suggests some 45 per cent of young adults (18-29) made their first ever investment in crypto. Data from Boring Money has 11 per cent of young adults (18-44) saying they own or have owned crypto assets. Among those who have only been investing in anything for a year or less, that number rises to 16 per cent. An ""alarming number"" of new buyers are ""funding this through a cocktail of credit cards, student loans, and other loans,"" says Interactive. An FCA survey suggests 58 per cent of people trading these kinds of ""highrisk products"" are taking their advice from ""social media and their friends"", a strategy that, financially speaking, does not have a stellar success record. The Treasury is concerned. It noted this week that while the number of people holding crypto is rising, ""understanding of crypto is actually declining, suggesting that some users may not fully understand what they are buying"". That may be particularly the case if they rely on the ads on social media and the London Underground. Consider one of the most discussed of these last year, from Luno Money. It said in very big letters: ""If you're seeing bitcoin on the underground, it's time to buy."" It did not mitigate that appeal to the fear of missing out, even in very small letters, with the information that in doing so you'd be buying a volatile, speculative maybeasset that comes with a high chance of capital losses. Supervision of cryptocurrency advertising is likely to transfer to the FCA. Such ads will have to be ""fair, clear and not misleading"". I can't imagine how a crypto ad will be upfront about having no yield, no obvious fundamental value and no accepted valuation method, for example and still be compelling. But would more accurate ads have made any difference? After all, not understanding how investments work isn't just about crypto. Last week, Interactive Investor produced a piece of research I loved. I often say here that the retail investor should outperform the professional for the simple reason that we have something they don't time. I was therefore delighted to see that over the past year the Private Investor Performance Index showed ordinary investors outperforming the professionals by a couple of percentage points. Younger investors, aged 18-24, have done remarkably well over the past two years, up 22.8 per cent, against 17.2 per cent for a mainstream index the Investment Association Mixed Investment 40-85 per cent shares sector. And the ""secret sauce"" driving the returns? A higher allocation to investment trusts.    I love investment trusts. But do the investors know what they are buying? Investment trusts' share prices can move some distance from their net asset value. You could buy them at a premium, something none of the investment platforms alert you to on their trading pages. But if sentiment turns against them you might end up selling at a discount to their net asset value. Result? You've lost a lot more money than the change in the share prices of the underlying holdings of the trust might suggest you should have. But it is also about what is in them. The top holding for the 18-24 age group is Scottish Mortgage. It holds lots of wonderful and exciting stocks you might want to hold for the very long term. Some make real money now. Others do not. But they promise huge growth and profits in the (uncertain) future. Those future profits are valued by discounting them with reference to today's interest rates. The lower interest rates are, the more future profits are worth. So the lower rates have fallen, the higher the prices of growth stocks have gone. That's one reason alongside good stockpicking that Scottish Mortgage has done so well for so many. You might think you bought a fabulous story about longevity, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, space travel or fossil fuel-free energy. In fact, you may have bought an asset super-sensitive to changes in interest rates, or what is known in the business as a long duration asset, the price of which will whipsaw as the discount rate used to value it does. Well, here we are. European value stocks outperformed growth stocks by almost 10 per cent in the first 17 days of 2022 and US value shares are ahead of growth by 6.4 per cent this year, says Duncan Lamont of Schroders. The Goldman Sachs index of unprofitable tech companies was earlier this week down 14 per cent from its peak. And Scottish Mortgage? I hold it and will keep holding, as I think the future usually comes good. But, if you only came in three months ago you are down 23 per cent. Did everyone who put their money into expensive growth stocks last year, when it was already obvious that inflation was not transitory, know what would happen to their duration story stocks when it was clear rates would have to rise? The ads for tech funds told you there was risk but this big one wasn't exactly highlighted. What about all those ESG funds? What's really in them? Are they too reliant on long duration assets? It's easier to shoehorn a low-profit tech stock or lossmaking renewable energy stock into your average ESG portfolio than a high dividend-paying miner. Owning them at extreme valuations is obviously different to owning a portfolio of cryptos, but there are similarities. Think about how far away the promise is and you might think of crypto as a long duration asset too. Anyone who has been having a bit of giggle about naive newbie investors and their 10 per cent losses on bitcoin so far this year might want to have a quick check that they really know what is in their own portfolio.

b364a0ef161c53fc2631,2022-01-21,Alstom: back on the rails,"Twitter: @FTLex Alstom has been stuck in the sidings recently. Investors in the French train maker still worry about the costs of turning round the Bombardier train unit acquired for €5.5bn a year ago. Then again, the absence of bad news in yesterday's third-quarter sales update provided some reassurance. Investors can start focusing on the opportunities from government spending on infrastructure and decarbonisation. Naysayers point to the scope for further delays and cost overruns from the projects Alstom acquired. Some investors would have liked more explicit guidance on free cash flow, after the massive €1.5bn outflow in the first half. But Alstom promises the bleeding has stopped, insisting it is on track to meet its financial targets. Analysis of the Bombardier backlog provides some support, says UBS. It concluded that the market had overreacted to the risks. Bombardierrelated provisions of more than €1bn already made should cover those. Though the shares are up 16 per cent over the past month, they have lost a third of their value over the past year. They trade on 11 times 2023 ebita, about a fifth lower than peers, according to Jefferies' estimates. There is an even bigger valuation gap with other shares favoured by ESG investors. But the fact that some 6,000 diesel trains operating in Europe face replacement as lines are electrified means Alstom should hold their attention. Where that is not an option, they will be powered using batteries or hydrogen. Alstom has already sold its hydrogen fuel cell-powered train which it calls the iLint to a number of European countries. Alstom should continue to benefit from infrastructure stimulus and spending on the green transition. As well as being Europe's rail champion, it has a footprint in the US. There is good visibility concerning future growth and the promise of rising operating profit margins. As confidence grows about the integration of the Bombardier unit, expect investors to switch back in."

ESG inflows surged throughout 2021, even as they slowed towards the end of the year, with global sustainable fund assets doubling in the six months to September 2021 to reach $3.9tn, according to data provider Morningstar. But the breakneck expansion could stall if performance starts to approach or underperform benchmarks, after years of high-flying returns driven by powerful rallies in growth stocks. At the end of December, the top stocks held across the 20 largest ESG funds, which together manage about $340bn in assets, were Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Apple, according to Rumi Mahmood, vicepresident of ESG research at MSCI. Yet while tech shares have been pandemic winners, they have taken a hit since the turn of the year, fuelling speculation a more sustained rotation towards value strategies lies ahead as the US Federal Reserve starts to withdraw its monetary stimulus. David McCann, equity analyst at Numis, said: ""I think it's going to be an important test for the industry. I'm not convinced that 100 per cent of people who are buying sustainable funds are doing so purely for environmental and ethical reasons. Many are in it as 'tourists' because these just happened to be the best performing funds."" The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite has had its worst start to the year in half a decade, falling briefly into correction territory after the Fed adopted a more hawkish tone this month before recovering to trade down 4.8 per cent since January 1. The fall may be just a blip, but a sustained shift could hurt ESG funds that have bet heavily on them. Tom Mills, analyst at Jefferies, said: ""Certain names are at the top: Microsoft, big tech, big healthcare ... have been trading high and are the names these funds are most overweight. If we rotate and rates rise, they will be all beaten up. Banks and resources could fare better, and those are generally underweighted by ESG funds."" Shares in some more specialist ESGfocused companies are down this year on worries this could soon materialise. London-based Impax has fallen 15 per cent and Liontrust about 14 per cent. ESG fund managers argue that sustainability has now become so baked in to investment strategies that a significant reversal is unlikely. Many investors consider certain energy and resource companies uninvestable, no matter how well their stocks do, fund managers say. And while interest rate rises discount shareholders' future returns on speculative tech companies, the investing audience for some has also exploded.    Amanda O'Toole, who runs a cleantech thematic fund at Axa Investment Managers, said: ""We've seen more and more of the broader market coming around to the idea that they need a net zero target and therefore need to buy clean energy to fuel their growth, so the addressable market for these companies has grown very rapidly."" Much store has been placed in the ability of cutting-edge tech to address sustainability issues. But fund managers are also looking for ESG prospects among more traditional companies. ""We have climate plays in every sector of the market,"" said Simon Webber, fund manager at Schroders, who thinks the likes of homebuilder Kingfisher, insurer Munich Re and carmaker BMW will be big winners in the climate shift. If there is a shakeout in sustainability investing ""there have been a lot of new entrants to the climate and ESG fund management business and we'll find out, just like with companies, who is good at what they do"", Webber said. Sustainable investing is also subject to mounting research costs that are expected to reach $1.3bn globally in 2022, straining thin investment house margins and risking sustainable strategies if a market correction takes hold. In Europe, research budgets at asset managers have more than halved between 2016 and 2022, estimates from Frost Consulting show, since the companies started financing them out of their own budgets instead of through investor fees because of Mifid II reforms. At the same time, the costs of running ESG strategies have soared as funds have launched and grown and may eclipse research budgets by 2024. ""Ironically, European asset managers are less resilient and less sustainable than they were [at the onset of the financial crisis],"" said Neil Scarth, of Frost Consulting. ""One reason is that in 2008 asset owners rather than asset managers were paying that huge research bill, and that has now evolved to be a significant ESG cost that didn't [previously] exist for many managers."" ESG strategies have big overheads because of high data and specialised research costs, and the need to hire stewardship departments to engage with companies several times a year. Scarth added: ""We are talking to some ... investment firms who are starting to re-examine the relationship between ESG revenues and costs, in an environment where none of these additional costs are met by asset owners.""

cc8871cc8269b313bb43,2022-01-19,Fink rejects criticisms that BlackRock has 'woke' agenda,"Financials Investors that focus on the interests of wider society rather than pure profits are not ""woke"", BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has said after stinging attacks from US conservatives. The head of the world's largest asset manager, which last week crossed the $10tn mark for the first time, used his annual corporate missive to chief executives to fight back against accusations that BlackRock was using its influence to push a progressive agenda. ""Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics,"" Fink said in the letter, entitled The Power of Capitalism. ""It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not 'woke'. It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers and communities your company relies on to prosper."" With more than $6.6tn in passive investment funds that track market indices, BlackRock is a big shareholder in most big companies around the world. This has often made Fink's annual letters an increasingly contentious talking point in the corporate world. BlackRock has in recent years been accused by some conservatives of being ""woke"" because of Fink's vocal support for investing according to environmental, social and governance standards. Consumers' Research, a US non-profit, argued last year that BlackRock's ""woke posturing"" was a smokescreen for funnelling money to Chinese companies through its investment funds, and launched an advertising campaign attacking the group. When the Biden administration's Department of Labor proposed allowing fund managers to include ESG as part of their fiduciary duty to investors last year, Republican senator Marco Rubio savaged it as ""the latest example of how the political left works"". ""They want to remake the entire country to comply with the latest woke agenda,"" he said. Senator Ted Cruz has argued that ""powerful CEOs have made the decision to use their companies to enforce the political agenda of today's Democratic party, which is controlled by the radical left"". BlackRock has also faced criticism from those on the left who say that it has not gone far enough in selling out of companies that are failing to cut their emissions or are big contributors to climate change. Fink defended BlackRock's strategy to engage with companies on the carbon transition rather than divesting altogether, arguing that companies themselves cannot be the ""climate police"" but must work with governments. He pointed out that passing carbonintensive companies from public to private markets would not solve the crisis. The green transition was an opportunity, Fink stressed, predicting that the Next 1,000 privately held companies valued above $1bn would be ""sustainable, scalable innovators"" rather than ""search engines or social media companies"". ""We focus on sustainability not because we're environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients,"" he wrote.    Fink's letter comes as the pandemic is transforming the labour market. In the US, the term ""Great Resignation"" now describes how thousands of people have quit their jobs in search of better remunerated or more rewarding work, or left the labour force altogether."
6a7b417d570760f0dbb7,2022-01-19,Real-world inspiration,"The case method is one of the most widely used teaching tools in business education. This award highlights examples that look beyond western boardrooms to explore the complex trade-offs that sustainability requires, writes Sarah Murray Case studies about sustainability are now playing a key role in shifting business school teaching away from the concept of shareholder primacy. As the Responsible Business Education Awards demonstrate, they cover an increasingly complex range of topics. Even so, some experts are calling for greater diversity in a teaching tool that, even when focused on sustainability, tends to explore the strategies of white men leading large companies in wealthy economies. ""Colleagues teaching in Latin America, Africa and Asia say it's hard for students to engage when most cases are still about North American or European companies, particularly since business challenges depend on local and regional contexts,"" says Mette Morsing, an award judge and head of the UN's Principles for Responsible Management Education initiative. Her view is shared by fellow judge Diane-Laure Arjaliès, associate professor at Canada's Ivey Business School. ""We tend to write case studies through a North American lens,"" she says. ""We need to get more diverse viewpoints into cases."" Nevertheless, this category of the awards — which recognises the best teaching cases published in the past three years with sustainability and climate change as key learning objectives — reflects a wide geographical diversity, drawing on examples from Europe, North America, Asia, South America and Africa. The entries also feature non-traditional organisations, such as social enterprises, community-driven initiatives and app designers. ""That's great, because in the past, we only used to have one type of case, which was mostly big NGOs [non-governmental organisations] or corporations,"" says Arjaliès. TEACHING CASES WINNERS Seren Pendleton-Knoll and Robert Strand University of California, Berkeley: Haas Daniel Kammen UC Berkeley Paul Hendricks and Vincent Stanley Patagonia Patagonia's Path to Carbon Neutrality by 2025 Syeda Maseeha Qumer and Debapratim Purkayastha ICFAI Business School SC Johnson and the Global Ocean Plastic Crisis Ryan Merrill, Hannah Chang, Liang Hao, Lan Yang and Adina Wong Singapore Management University Growing a Global Forest: Ant Financial, Alipay, and the Ant Forest Amy Moore and Verity Hawarden University of Pretoria: Gordon Institute of Business Science Abelana Game Reserve: Community Partnership Driving Shared Value in Ecotourism HIGHLY COMMENDED Rotterdam School of Management Sustainable Development Goals case series FOR FULL SHORTLIST, VISIT FT.COM/RBE Topics in the shortlist range from how a social enterprise has worked to install solar-powered lighting in India to how a ""green bank"" created financing vehicles to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency in the US. Also covered are sustainable fashion, clean water and sanitation, electric vehicles, mobile apps and sustainable cities. In one unusual approach that was highly commended by the judges, writers at Rotterdam School of Management produced a collection of case studies focusing on corporate engagement with the UN's Sustainable Development    Goals. They were based on a framework developed by Rob van Tulder, professor of international business-society management at RSM, and made available free online. For van Tulder, the idea was to highlight that, when it comes to sustainability, there is often no single solution and even the best solution may come with complex trade-offs. ""What we're trying to achieve is an effort in critical thinking,"" he says. Morsing believes this philosophy should shape case studies. ""I would like to have seen fewer cases that target a specific pre-defined 'solution',"" she says. This, she explains, is because, in the real world, business challenges such as the circular economy and the greening of supply chains have no pre-set solutions. ""We need to teach students to identify the real challenges and possible solutions through their own research and discussions with industry leaders."" Carbon emissions reduction and waste management emerge as strong themes in the competition, with a smaller number of case studies featuring business approaches to human rights. Even so, while many of the shortlisted and winning cases lead with an environmental challenge, they also explore social issues, whether that is the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities or the role of consumers in advancing climate action. This is true of one of the four winners, a case study on efforts by Patagonia, a US outdoor clothing company, to become carbon neutral by 2025. ""Patagonia has made a significant effort not only in terms of sourcing renewable energy but alsoin terms of livelihoods and minimum wages,"" says Daniel Kammen, one of the authors. What attracted the writers to Patagonia was the combination of its environmental goals and its concern for its impact on people, both employees and the enterprises in its supply chain. ""We started with energy because we knew they'd made progress there,"" says Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley. ""But, as soon as you say that energy is not just about green or brown kilowatts, it's also about the impact on water and land, you get this broader perspective."" Similarly, another of the four winners — a case study on US cleaning products multinational SC Johnson — looks at a large company's efforts to solve a complex environmental problem while examining its impact on communities. The case study, which focuses on SC Johnson's efforts to tackle the global crisis of plastic waste in oceans, features a partnership with Plastic Bank, a social enterprise, to increase recycling while addressing poverty. Their programme gives local waste collectors in countries such as Indonesia and Brazil digital tokens for the plastic they bring in, which they can use to buy goods and services. For one of the authors, Syeda Maseeha, an adjunct research faculty member at India's Icfai Business School, these kinds of cases also inspire students to think about their own role in tackling big global problems. ""Teaching responsible business through cases helps in understanding the concept of responsible business from various perspectives,"" she says. But, she adds, it also allows students to ""pick apart what they can do to help tackle issues such as climate change and global poverty"". In fact, the natural world and community livelihoods are often inextricably linked, as demonstrated in another winning case study featuring South Africa's Abelana Game Reserve and its efforts to promote ecotourism while benefiting local communities. The case examines a partnership that the Abelana management team developed with the game reserve and the Mashishimale community, which owns the land, to train workers, create jobs in the community and support local businesses. It allows a variety of sustainability issues to be explored: from constructing roads and other infrastructure while minimising environmental impact to training employees to work in two luxury lodges (most had never stayed in a hotel before) and shifting how the community viewed animals — from short-term benefit as food to long-term value as part of sustainable tourism. ""We tried to bring out what sustainability means in an ecotourism destination,"" says Amy Moore, an executive coach and facilitator for the University of Pretoria's Gordon Institute of Business Science. ""What we thought was particularly interesting was the complexity of community engagement strategies and how important collaborative relationships are in cross-sector partnerships."" For the fourth winner, environment and society come together in Ant Forest, a lifestyle app on the Chinese payment platform Alipay. The app grants ""energy points"" to users adopting low-carbon habits, such as cutting plastic waste or walking instead of driving to work. When they have enough energy points, Ant Forest, through its partners, plants a tree on their behalf in Inner Mongolia and other arid regions of China. While the app, which was    launched in 2016 as a corporate social responsibility initiative, has social impact (it promotes the health of users), the tree planting has environmental benefits in areas where forestation is being used to arrest desertification. Initially, bringing together discussions of responsible business and climate change seemed challenging, says Hannah Chang, one of the authors and associate professor of marketing and director of PhD programmes at Singapore Management University's Lee Kong Chian School of Business. ""But the topic allowed us to merge different disciplinary angles together to form a more interdisciplinary case,"" she says. ""Teaching it has been fun. People from different classes might have a different focus, but this allows for a flexibility in the discussions that students really enjoy.""

2effad3ad2c90e975201,2022-01-19,Turning ideas into action,"Business schools' efforts to promote responsible capitalism will ultimately be judged by the graduates they produce. The winners of this award combine entrepreneurial flair with a passion for sustainability It used to be so simple: business schools could tailor courses to traditional career paths, such as banking, investment and consulting, and equip alumni with the knowhow to accelerate up the corporate ladder and maximise their salaries. The better the alumni performed, the better the schools performed in MBA rankings, and the more candidates vied for a place. But the equation has changed. Business schools are shaping a generation of leaders in a world that needs sustainable growth amid a climate crisis and insistent calls for social justice. Managers are expected to address environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues; entrepreneurs want to make profits with a purpose. Curricula have shifted accordingly. They now include ESG electives, for example, and more entrepreneur-specific courses. Many business schools also connect students with entrepreneurial networks, host inspirational talks or have established incubators to help get ideas offthe ground. The ""alumni change makers"" award highlights arguably the most important product of these efforts: the graduates whose task it will be to create and shape tomorrow's sustainable businesses. It celebrates alumni who are tackling society's challenges head on, whether in health, conservation or manufacturing. Among them is George Boghos, who is in no doubt that business school was critical to launching his company. ""But for the resources, I probably would not have pursued this path,"" he says. ""I probably would have gone back to a traditional finance role."" Boghos graduated with an MBA from Chicago Booth in 2018 and co-founded Autism in Motion (AIM) Clinics while studying. The company provides behavioural therapy for children with autism and focuses on underserved rural populations, particularly in the southeastern states of the US. As well as providing clinics, the company has created a fellowship programme to help train the next generation of clinicians. Before the MBA, Boghos worked in investment banking and private equity, both with a healthcare focus. He took the course with ""the idea of exploring the entrepreneurship paths, specifically focused on this area within healthcare"", he says, and picked Chicago Booth because of its support for entrepreneurship and social impact. It is home to the Rustandy Center for Social Sector Innovation, which runs an incubator that Boghos went through. ""That really helped me frame out what the idea and strategy is — it connected me with resources,"" he says. ""It really helped me crystallise how this is a mission-driven organisation and how we track and measure the impact we're making."" Not all entrepreneurs go to business school with an idea in mind. Johanna Baare had spent six years working at a start-up consultancy before starting the Global MBA at Madrid's IE Business School in 2018. As she progressed through the programme, she realised that she was interested in building an organisation.    For her thesis, she worked with a group of fellow students to craft the business plan for a potential start-up and felt that one question always hung in the air: who is actually going to make this happen? ""I always said, 'Well, I would love to do that, but I don't have the idea',"" she says. After she graduated, Baare joined a German incubator and began mentoring Anne Lamp, who had invented a sustainable alternative to plastic. The two worked well together and realised that their technical and business backgrounds were complementary so, in September 2020, they co-founded Traceless to bring the product to market. As the business lead in a small start-up, Baare undertakes tasks ranging from finance to legal work and hiring. The MBA stands her in good stead for this, she says, as it has introduced her to a broad range of business concepts so she knows where to find information and what questions to ask advisers. ""You get the overview, the understanding of how the things are related [in a business],"" she explains. Such insights and perspectives were what Elisa Dierickx was looking for when she enrolled on an MBA at Insead. In 2011, after her undergraduate studies in organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard, Dierickx moved to Cape Verde to co-found a nature conservation non-governmental organisation (NGO) on the island of Maio. Its programmes include preventing turtle poaching and developing a marine protected area. Over a decade, Dierickx built Fundação Maio Biodiversidade (FMB), alongside pursuing other professional avenues, including a PhD in zoology from the University of Cambridge. But ""conservation is really an interdisciplinary field"", she says, and she realised that to have a larger impact she needed to bridge the worlds of ""nature lovers"" — NGOs and academia — and business. ""As a first step, I thought the MBA would be perfect.. . It is good to learn that language, learn the other perspective and learn some of their tools,"" Dierickx says. Already, FMB is putting the new perspectives from business school to good use. Dierickx worked with two professors to write cases featuring FMB — one on organisational behaviour and another on strategy. The latter was used in Insead's Master Strategist Day, part of the strategy course, where students, in collaboration with mentors from Bain, the consultancy, present recommendations on companies' dilemmas. ""It is a huge wealth of informationfor us to explore,"" says Dierickx. Some of it is already having an effect: as part of the exercise, FMB asked students how it should approach a tourist resort being planned for Maio: should the NGO fight it, ignore it or work with developers? The different perspectives, bringing in interdisciplinary views, ""shifted some of our teammates' opinions at FMB"", notes Dierickx. Social and environmental impact is not the sole preserve of start-ups and NGOs. Highly commended change maker Chaoxing David Fu made his mark at an established Chinese energy business after completing an MBA at China Europe International Business School (Ceibs) in Shanghai. Fu had left China at the age of 12 and gone on to pursue a career in Silicon Valley. But, in 2015, as he flew to northern China for a friend's wedding, he looked out of the aeroplane as it landed and saw a blanket of smog. It was, he says, a turning point: ""I said to myself, 'Enough is enough. I want to make a change. I want to make an impact.' That's why I chose to come back to China."" Ceibs appealed to him because of the insights it could offer into China's business culture, along with opportunities to build a network. ""A lot of the things we learn in the west, like the techniques or marketing terms or methods back in the US, are not applicable in China,"" Fu says. ""So we learnt the same skill set with Chinese characteristics. That's a big part of what Ceibs offered."" In 2020, Fu became a full-time executive board member at the Gujiao Guosheng Coalbed Methane Company in Shanxi province. His work includes forming a strategic partnership with the local government to increase public use of natural gas for heating and cooking instead of coal. He is also trying to stabilise the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) so that the local transport network can invest in LNG lorry fleets, rather than diesel. The next step is building storage units for LNG to minimise gas flaring. Nearly seven years on from his smoggy epiphany, Fu is proud of what he has achieved. ""Every time you see the blue sky, you feel that is something you did,"" he says. It is a sentiment that may strike a chord with Gaetano Lapenta. In his graduation speech from the executive MBA at Italy's Politecnico di Milano School of Management in 2019, he focused on one message: that the cohort had been given a chance to make a success of something they were passionate about.    Before taking the course, Lapenta was head of innovation at construction company Focchi Group but felt restless — he is, he says, a person who needs ""fire"". He is now co-founder and chief executive of Fybra, a start-up specialising in indoor air quality. Its smart sensors indicate precisely when more ventilation is needed in offices and classrooms, maximising both air quality and energy efficiency. The algorithm it uses can also be adjusted to minimise transmission of airborne diseases such as Covid-19. The idea came to Lapenta during his time at Politecnico di Milano, and he applied for a patent in January 2020. Some 18 months later, he quit Focchi to go it alone, setting Fybra up with co-founder Marco Scaramelli. Lapenta says he pursued an EMBA because he ""felt this passion that was burning, but.. . did not have the tools to deliver it in reality"". Now, however, his aspiration has become a real business. ""The good match between passion and reality came with the hard skills of the MBA,"" he says. Inspiring though such projects are, some alumni feel that business schools have more to do when it comes to teaching ESG. Shortlistee Harry Hely-Hutchinson, a recent Iese graduate, says that while he would not have started his business without the MBA, there is room for improvement. He feels there is ""still a strong focus on the traditional career paths, like consulting and finance, because that is what is good for the rankings"" — at the expense of start-ups and entrepreneurship. Similarly, fellow shortlistee Giorgia Granata, who completed a London Business School MBA in 2018, credits the course with many advantages, such as valuable knowledge and a strong network. But she adds that sustainability was still treated as a ""fringe topic"", when it should have been integrated into the core curriculum — it is, she says, simply too important to be optional.

185c8e06a989ab000228,2022-01-19,How to walk the ESG talk,"Putting environmental, social and governance concerns on the curriculum is only the start. Many schools are also trying to practise what they preach with climate-friendly campuses and ambitious diversity initiatives. By Ian Wylie It was not so long ago that Jaclyn Rosebrook-Collignon and her colleagues were dismissed as the ""hippies on the third floor"". But, over the 12 years that she has been head of sustainability and global responsibility at Grenoble Ecole de Management (GEM) in France, she has seen her role change from that of grassroots agitator to boardroom influencer. ""For many years, people used to run away from me when they saw me in the hall,"" says Rosebrook-Collignon. ""Now, students and faculty are coming to me and asking, what are we doing to be more sustainable and how can we go faster?"" Business schools' initial response to the explosion of interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues was a rethink of curricula, introducing relevant electives and programmes. More recently, they have been busy revamping their campuses, installing new waste collection systems, solar panels, wind turbines and even bee colonies, as deans try to practise what they preach. But, now, says Rosebrook-Collignon, business schools must go beyond unconnected ad-hoc initiatives, bolt-on courses and compliance checklists. To truly ""walk the talk"", they must undergo ""whole organisation transformation"", she argues. For GEM, that has meant adopting société à mission status. Like benefit corporations in the US, sociétés à mission are defined by law as organisations that aim to make a positive difference to society and the environment. So far, some 100 organisations — mostly large companies — have assumed this status in France. Grenoble is the first business school to take the step. What this means in practice, according to Rosebrook-Collignon, is that everything the school does has to be consistent with five commitments — including gender equality and becoming a zero-waste school — that are linked to one or more of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Retaining société à mission status requires full disclosure of the school's activities, checked by an external audit every two years. ""An overwhelming majority of our staffand students want to contribute positively to society, but to enable them to do that requires cultural transformation and real, strategic, top-down action,"" says Rosebrook-Collignon. ""This new status means each part of the business school must re-evaluate its annual objectives through this prism. But it also increases the visibility of what we are delivering and the pressure on us to do what we say we're doing. Our stakeholders, and notably our students and faculty, are looking for that transparency and accountability."" Other schools have also turned to the SDGs to frame their sustainability efforts. BI Norwegian Business School has selected SDG 13, climate action, as a priority (along with SDG 5, gender equality) and has set out to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. To that end, it is taking measures that range from installing solar panels and using seawater cooling at its Trondheim and Stavanger campuses to serving more vegetarian and locally sourced food in its cafeterias and re-upholstering chairs instead of buying new. ""To achieve our climate goal, we need to make significant changes to how we work,"" says BI president Inge Jan Henjesand. ""We're well under way on many dimensions, including cutting single-use plastics, increasing recycling rates and cutting carbon-intensive foods. The last year has also seen a significant cut in business travel. But we need to continue this momentum.""    There is wide variation in schools' efforts to tackle climate change. When the FT surveyed more than 140 leading business schools in 2020, fewer than a third said that becoming carbon neutral was an objective. Just over a dozen had set deadlines of 2030 or earlier, while others gave target dates as distant as 2060 (see table, page 33). Among the more ambitious, today, is Haas School of Business. It is working with its parent institution, the University of California, Berkeley, to be carbon neutral by 2025, for both direct emissions and indirect emissions arising from electricity consumed (its target for indirect emissions elsewhere in its value chain — so-called Scope 3 emissions — is 2050). Two of the four buildings on its campus are certified as zero-waste — defined as diverting more than 90 per cent of refuse from landfill. Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington DC says it has reached its target of being carbon neutral already, after pledging in 2010 to cut its emissions to net zero within a decade. The university and business school have made buildings more efficient, promoted eco-friendly behaviour among staffand students — from switching offlights to changing commuting habits — installed 2,500 solar panels on campus and offset international travel emissions by buying energy-efficient stoves for rural families in Kenya. In April 2021, American released a new five-year sustainability plan which, says Megan Litke, director of sustainability programmes, is designed to move ""beyond carbon emissions and into the broader sustainability problems and how they impact our communities"". A similar social awareness informs other schools' strategies. At HEC Paris, Marcelle Laliberté says the key to achieving her goals as chief diversity officer is to take a holistic approach. ""It's our work as a business school to intersect diversity with research, teaching and action,"" she says. Initiatives include a programme called Stand Up, run by HEC's Innovation & Entrepreneurship Center, which is aimed at women from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similarly, the Paris branch of Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) — a seed-stage programme co-led by HEC entrepreneurship professor Thomas Astebro for technology start-ups — tries to promote a fairer gender balance in the sector. Applicants are asked to provide demographic data, including gender, which enables CDL to judge its success. The gender mix among entrepreneurs admitted to the programme is also monitored with a view to identifying any bias against female-founded companies. Astebro says its application-scoring mechanism means 45 per cent of CDL-Paris's ventures have a female founder, while almost 30 per cent of the programme's mentors are women. To put this into context, companies with solely female founders accounted for just 2.2 per cent of global venture funding in the first eight months of 2021, according to start-up platform Crunchbase. ""That natural reflex — where we ask ourselves questions like, are we considering gender or are we considering disabilities? — is much more dominant than it was even three years ago,"" says Laliberté. ""There's a mindful awareness now of integrating diversity into the actions we take from the outset, as opposed to [treating] it as an afterthought.""

c49aea3db7bf22d411b1,2022-01-19,Drivers of change,"The doctrine of shareholder primacy that reigned at business schools for decades is often blamed for crises and scandals. Now, social purpose is coming to the fore — but the shift is not smooth BY SEB MURRAY ILLUSTRATIONS BY BRATISLAV MILENKOVIC Leon Laubscher belongs to a new generation of business school alumni — one very different from the profit-obsessed cohorts that once emerged from MBA classrooms. Where his pre-2010s predecessors went all out for investor returns, Laubscher argues that companies should put social purpose before, or at least on a par with, profit. ""The role of business has changed significantly,"" he says. ""It's not just about creating shareholder value any more; we need to be looking after the environment and making a positive contribution in society."" Laubscher says one visiting professor — Lawrence Pratt — helped him see the link between sustainability and profitability during his MBA at Rotterdam School of Management in 2019. ""A lot of people think sustainability is this hippy, tree-hugger thing, but the professor drew the connection with financial performance,"" Laubscher says. The course content was, he adds, highly relevant to his work at consumer goods group Unilever, where he is a strategy manager in the global sustainability team. ""We need to figure out how to decouple environmental impact from business growth,"" Laubscher says. Business schools are overhauling their programmes, shifting away from the shareholder-primacy doctrine that has shaped much of their teaching in recent decades. Instead, they are emphasising social purpose and environmental concerns. But for reasons such as institutional inertia and graduate employability, the shift is proving difficult. This is not new ground for business schools: if anything, it is a return to their roots. Many institutions prioritised the advancement of moral and social objectives throughout the late 19th and much of the 20th century. Business schools in the US were built on these principles. In 1881, the Wharton School was established at the University of Pennsylvania to prepare graduates to become ""pillars of the state"" and advance society as a whole. In 1908, Harvard Business School's founding mission was to train leaders who ""make a decent profit — decently"". JC Spender, emeritus research fellow at the Institute for Ethical Leadership at Rutgers Business School in New Jersey, says that, back then, there was a rich tradition of teaching business ethics at business school. ""Management was seen as a socially orientated activity,"" he says. Things started to change at the end of the 1950s, when the Carnegie and Ford foundations produced influential reports that heavily criticised the lack of scientific rigour in business education. Under fire for their reliance on practitioners for teaching, schools responded by placing a greater emphasis on scientific business research. Many professors found the shareholder-primacy model attractive, as it was simple and quantifiable. ""When you adopt mathematical analysis, you have to focus on the things you can measure — and that's profit,"" says Spender.    Influential economists reinforced interest in the theory. Milton Friedman, the University of Chicago economist, argued in a landmark 1970 essay that the sole responsibility of a company was to make profits for shareholders. In 1976, Michael Jensen, then an associate professor at the University of Rochester's business school in upstate New York, and William Meckling, then dean, popularised agency theory, which explored the mismatch between shareholders' and managers' interests, and proposed aligning them through share options. ""Extreme shareholder value maximisation became the dominant paradigm at business schools,"" says Peter Tufano, former dean at the University of Oxford's Saïd Business School. ""In the 1980s and 1990s, we saw the increasingly dominant presence of economists on business school faculties."" The bull market of the 1990s helped fuel the rise of shareholder primacy but also led to unintended consequences for society, such as growing inequality. Even Jensen conceded in 2002, after the dotcom crash, that agency theory could cause harm. During the pre-crash bubble, share options had, he said, become ""managerial heroin"", driving a focus on short-term prices even if the long-term consequences were disastrous. The excesses and corporate wrongdoing of the early 2000s reinforced this idea. After the collapse of Enron and the accounting scandals at Tyco and WorldCom, business schools came under fire. Sumantra Ghoshal, a professor at London Business School, argued in a 2005 paper that by teaching ""amoral"" theories, business schools had ""actively freed their students from any sense of moral responsibility"". Schools placed greater emphasis on ethical practices, integrity and transparency in MBA curriculums. ""The great corruption debacles at Enron and other companies created an environment where we questioned business morals,"" says David Chen, adjunct professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois. That questioning went deeper after the 2008 financial crisis. Business schools, long a pipeline of talent for banks, were seen as partly culpable. In a 2009 paper, academics Robert Giacalone and Donald Wargo wrote that the financial crash had resulted from the ""toxic teaching of bad management theories"" and the ""cult of profit maximisation"" spread by MBA courses. Amid the soul-searching that followed the turmoil, business schools ramped up courses on ethics, professional responsibility and risk management. ""There was a belief that business schools only teach greed and profit maximisation,"" says Ilian Mihov, dean of Insead in France since 2013. ""For me, it was a matter of survival: if we continue doing this we will become irrelevant."" In the past decade, growing awareness of the climate emergency has increased demand for courses on sustainability and responsible business practices — subjects that have become a big draw for prospective students. Reetta Nevala, head of business development at Honkajoki, a Finnish company that processes and refines animal byproducts, chose her part-time MBA at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland, last year, because of its emphasis on sustainability. ""If we want to provide an environment for future generations, then we need to find profitable solutions to the climate crisis,"" she says. The course is relevant to Nevala's work at Honkajoki, including the company's drive to promote more sustainable food production. In her sustainability module, for example, she developed a business model for a new pet food protein made from the larvae of the black soldier fly. ""Insect protein can reduce food-related carbon footprints,"" says Nevala, though Finland's food regulations have constrained her ability to develop the product. One barrier to teaching social purpose on MBAs has been the pressure to create employment opportunities for students so that they can pay offhigh tuition fees. ""There has been this dichotomy where, if we focus on sustainability and responsible business, but corporate cultures are driven by profit maximisation, then it translates into fewer jobs and lower salaries,"" says Dan LeClair, chief executive of the Global Business School Network, a group of more than 120 business schools across 50 countries. Many businesses are now championing change. In 2019, the Business Roundtable, a group of US chief executives, dropped the shareholder-primacy doctrine and urged companies to ""protect the environment"" and treat workers with ""dignity and respect"". Many companies are not, however, spreading the word to potential employees. ""We see companies that have robust ESG [environmental, social and governance] strategies, but they don't talk about it in recruiting,"" says    Tensie Whelan, clinical professor of business and society at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""So students think they just need traditional skills to get a decent job and pay back their loans. Employers need to be a lot clearer."" The result is that many students stick with traditional subjects such as finance and strategy, which they perceive as more likely to lead to high-paying careers in finance, consulting or technology. If schools are to nurture the next generation of responsible leaders — and avoid promoting poor management practices — they will need to integrate sustainability topics into those core courses, says Alfons Sauquet, quality services director at the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD), a business school accreditation body. Yet many schools still offer ESG courses only as electives. ""You cannot teach in silos,"" Sauquet says, arguing that ESG should be seen not as a standalone subject that students take, but instead as a lens through which every business function is viewed. Accreditation bodies are driving change: EFMD stresses that ethical behaviour, social responsibility and sustainability should be embedded in business school policies and operations, teaching and research. Yet deans encounter tensions, citing time pressure on professors — and their conservatism. ""If you are already very busy and have successful teaching materials, then you will be reluctant to move into new areas,"" says Ding Yuan, dean of Ceibs in Shanghai. ""The academic world is not known for its speed."" David Reibstein, professor of marketing at Wharton and chair of the Responsible Research in Business & Management network, says part of the problem is academia's ""publish or perish"" culture. Rankings, funding and promotions are tied to prestigious journals that neglect socially orientated research, thereby limiting course content, he argues. ""The dependent variable in all our activities is profitability,"" says Reibstein. ""We know how to measure profitability. We don't necessarily know how to measure social impact."" Omid Aschari, associate professor of strategic management at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland, believes schools that do not embrace a new approach are risking obsolescence, noting that students are becoming vocal proponents for change. ""The risk,"" he says, ""is that if students do not see the real world reflected in the curriculum, then business schools will become museums of management history."" 'We need to figure out how to decouple environmental impact from business growth' 'There was a belief that business schools only teach greed and profit maximisation' 'We know how to measure profitability. We don't necessarily know how to measure social impact'"
25174a560ec2ce0553f5,2022-01-19,Shades of green,"As business schools scramble to embrace sustainability, rankings providers are seeking to evaluate their efforts. While there is no 'one size fits all' metric, a compilation of data from different sources offers a broad perspective on schools' ambitions. These days, there is no shortage of advocates for ""kinder and greener"" MBAs. Many campaigners now criticise business school rankings for focusing on graduates' salaries rather than the tools and values needed for a more responsible form of capitalism. But, while a growing number of institutions are launching sustainability courses, institutes and other initiatives, progress in assessing their extent and effect lags behind. Most reporting remains descriptive, anecdotal and difficult to measure. As the table opposite shows, efforts to track progress more rigorously are nonetheless under way. They offer some indications of the business schools that are doing more according to a range of data points. The FT's business school rankings, like some others, have long assessed factors such as gender and international diversity among students, faculty and leadership. More recently, they have sought to track the extent to which environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are integrated into teaching. In compiling the table, the FT's researchers took as a starting point ESG in teaching in the 2021 FT Global MBA rankings. Participating schools are accredited by a leading agency (the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business or Equis), have classes of a certain minimum size and agree to share data. Iese in Spain, Edhec in France and Darden in the US all performed strongly. The researchers then compared the FT's performance measures with data produced by other emerging benchmarks. The variations are significant. There is no attempt to provide an overall ranking: the methodologies vary, data are imperfect and the time frames and breadth of analysis (sometimes business schools; in other cases their wider university) are not directly comparable. Instead, schools are listed in alphabetical order. The FT asked whether they had target dates to become net carbon neutral. While business schools may not be significant CO2 producers in their own right, and some have inherited older buildings that are less efficient, those with targets demonstrate a commitment to tackling climate change and set an example to students and faculty. Darden achieved net zero emissions in 2018, helped by an innovative partnership with a local solar power station. A further 13 schools aim to reach the goal by 2030, including six within the next three years. Several have targets as far off as 2050, or even 2060 in the case of Miami Herbert Business School, while seven have disclosed no target at all. Many focus only on Scope 1 and 2 emissions (respectively those directly produced by the school and those arising from the energy it buys) or on those plus some parts of Scope 3 emissions (which cover all other parts of the value chain, including travel). A second way to assess business schools' societal impact is through their research output. Wilfred Mijnhardt, policy director at Rotterdam School of Management (RSM), studied the proportion of papers published by academics in top schools between 2018 and 2021 that addressed topics in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By this measure, Edinburgh, Melbourne and Esade all score highly. A more holistic assessment comes from Corporate Knights, a Canadian publisher, which produces an annual Better World MBA ranking based on factors such as the integration of sustainability into core courses, research and specialist institutes and centres, as well as faculty gender and racial diversity. Its most recent edition places    Australia's Griffith Business School top, followed by Maastricht University's School of Business and Economics in the Netherlands, though neither make it on to the FT list. Others that score well but are on the FT list include Warwick, Durham and Edinburgh in the UK, along with St Gallen. The Positive Impact Rating for business schools published its second evaluation in 2021 based on 8,800 student assessments of factors including culture, governance, learning methods and public engagement. It gives four stars to Fordham and Grenoble Ecole de Management in France, as well as Esade in Spain. Times Higher Education also runs an impact ranking for universities, using data such as research, operations and teaching benchmarked against the SDGs. Assuming business schools rate in line with their parent institutions, some of the best are Alliance Manchester and Leeds in the UK and Melbourne and Monash in Australia. Finally, the heavily US-focused Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (Stars) — produced by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, which also judges universities overall — gives its highest ""platinum"" rating to Cornell, Berkeley and the University of Connecticut, each of which has a business school. Despite the differing assessment methodologies, the trends and links provide prospective students, employers and faculty alike with a rich range of benchmarks — and business schools with plenty of room for improvement.

df650a6c7509ff53bf2e,2022-01-18,Unilever's big game hunting leaves investors wary,"U nilever, as we know from Terry Smith, is keen on purpose. And the purpose of its sudden announcement of a strategic rethink and organisational overhaul was very clear: damage limitation. There's no use crying over spilled mayonnaise but the consumer-goods group finds itself in a bit of a pickle. Smith's broadside last week about purpose-driven condiments and a management team ""obsessed with publicly displaying sustainability credentials"" highlighted broader investor dissatisfaction with Unilever's lacklustre performance. Then came this weekend's revelation that Unilever had made three approaches to buy the consumer- healthcare unit being spun off by Glaxo- SmithKline. The £50bn price tag already dismissed as too low prompted concerns about elevated debt levels, an equity raise and what cost savings are really on offer from bolting the two portfolios of brands together. No wonder Unilever's shares fell 7 per cent yesterday. There is, however, a more basic problem here. Smith's criticism was not just about whether or not Hellmann's needs a waste-saving sine qua non. It was whether this kind of sustainable or socially engaged management is being used as a smokescreen for poor execution. But that is the rub: investors are questioning Unilever's decision-making on issues such as sales growth versus margin preservation, around investment and innovation and on whether it has been aggressive enough in using deals to reinvigorate its massive portfolio of household, food, beauty and personalcare brands. Everyone should know this has little intrinsically to do with Unilever's (laudable) commitment to sustainability because, as Bernstein's Bruno Monteyne points out, we have had exactly this conversation before. In 2007, Unilever was under fire for insipid share price performance thanks to ""poor category growth, poor and unpredictable execution, insufficient capex [and] doubts about the culture"", said Monteyne. What happened, with former chief executive Paul Polman arriving a little over a year later, is that Unilever managed a twofer: in the next five years, it tackled concerns about the fundamentals while also re-upping on environmental and social impact. Now, it's the turn of Alan Jope, who took the top job in 2019. In fairness, Jope has identified the underlying problems. The company's focus on profitability was Polman's response to the rejected 2017 bid from rampaging capitalists Kraft Heinz but that hasn't served it well in the growthiest of growth-focused markets. But Unilever, Jope said, last year was delivering its fastest underlying growth in eight years. The reorganisation he flagged is a wholesale replumbing of the bureaucratic Unilever empire boring but important and has been in train for more than a year. Still, Unilever's share price has gone sideways for five. The GSK unit, where toothpaste and vitamins could fit with Unilever's new focus on health, beauty and hygiene, and present opportunities in emerging markets, has been growing 3 per cent, hardly earth shattering and not dissimilar from Unilever's average underlying growth.    The promise to investors is that this big buy would come with big sales, getting out of more sluggish areas such as food, which has typically grown at 1-2 per cent. It's more than that, though. One way or another, Unilever is going big-game hunting (if its ESG framework ever possibly allowed such a thing). It's hard to find targets big enough to make a real difference in exciting, highgrowth areas, such as prestige beauty. The costs and tax bill from unwinding businesses from Unilever's tightly bound structure are meaningful. Those need to be balanced by cost savings from a big purchase to make it really work. If it isn't GSK's business (and given the price expectations the drugmaker apparently has, it may not be) the company will look for another big prey. The trouble is that investors wary of a sustainability smokescreen will be equally sceptical of how the disruption and upheaval from large-scale dealmaking can act as a camouflage to problems on the shop floor. And that the natural response to concerns that a management team hasn't done well enough in squeezing growth out of its existing £90bn collection of brands isn't to hand it another £50bn to play with. helen.thomas@ft.com Upheaval from large-scale dealmaking can act as a camouflage to problems on the shop floor"
8cf71b59be673b928805,2022-01-18,Babcock chief accuses anti-defence campaigners of 'hijacking' sustainable investment,"Aerospace & defence Anti-defence lobbyists are trying to hijack the ethical investment agenda for their own aims, the head of Britain's second-biggest defence contractor has warned. ""Liberal democracies lead the way on environment, society and governance [ESG] and you can't maintain a liberal democracy without robust defence,"" David Lockwood, chief executive of Babcock International, told the Financial Times in an interview. ""I think the fact that the anti-defence lobby tries to hijack the ESG lobby is really bad. It can't be environment; it can't be governance because we are the most governed industry going. So they must be arguing we are bad for society and that is just nonsense."" Babcock is one of the key contractors for the Ministry of Defence, and Lockwood said weapons makers had an important role to play in keeping the world safe. Defence contractors have become increasingly concerned in recent months that the sweeping trend for ESG investment would lead to their shares being shunned by institutional investors. Norwegian investment fund KLP recently sold out of Rolls-Royce because of its connections to Britain's nuclear deterrent. The FTSE 100 aerospace company makes the nuclear reactors that power the Royal Navy's Tridentmissile submarines. Sir Roger Carr, chair of BAE Systems, Britain's biggest defence group, spoke recently of the risk of some sectors being ""blackballed."" Lockwood's comments echo those of Rupert Soames, chief executive of outsourcer Serco, who recently warned of ""unintended consequences"" from the rise in ESG standards that could force some public companies to go private. Lockwood, who started as chief executive of the FTSE 250 group 15 months ago, said investors remained ""supportive"" but that the industry needed to be more robust about the important role it plays. The three elements of ESG should be seen as three distinct issues, he added, noting that Babcock had made progress on reducing its environmental impact and aimed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Lockwood, the former head of aerospace group Cobham, struck an optimistic tone that his turnround of Babcock was on track. The group made an operating profit in the first half of its financial year in December, after plunging to an operating loss of £1.6bn for the full year in the summer. The steep loss was largely due to one-off, non-cash impairments, the result of a review of its contract and balance sheet profitability. Babcock's share price has rebounded from a low of around £2 a share a year ago to close at £3.45p yesterday. Lockwood said his aim was to finish the turnround by the company's next full-year results in May, by which time he would be able to tell shareholders ""this is the shape of the business, here is the investment proposition"".    The company has already reached its target of raising at least £400m from asset disposals. Lockwood declined to comment on whether Babcock's rail business might still be sold but noted that ""we won't stop just because we've got the £400m. We will stop when we have the group in the right shape""."
5f26b31b0565c294c237,2022-01-17,Building the right culture attracts and keeps talent,"How to Lead. Bill Stromberg, former chief executive, T Rowe Price The highest pay is not why people stay at firms, they 'want to be a part of something special', ex-boss tells Madison Darbyshire I n the weeks leading up to his retirement, Bill Stromberg was reflective. People in the asset management industry are tired, he says, after keeping up with a rate of change that has only been amplified and intensified during the pandemic. In his 35 years at T Rowe Price, including six as chief executive, Stromberg has guided the Baltimore-based $1.69tn asset manager through a volatile period of change for the industry, as pressure on fees, technological innovation and the acceleration of new investment vehicles such as exchange traded funds have forced traditional managers to evolve at breakneck speed. ""Asset management has changed more in the last dozen years than in the last three decades before,"" he says. The rate of change was difficult to keep up with, for everyone. ""If you combine this with a pandemic, there is a level of fatigue among asset management in particular that is unusual,"" he says. This fatigue being felt across the sector, he says, drew new attention to company culture. In a time when employers are ratcheting up benefits and salaries to hold on to burnt out employees, and job changes are hitting record levels, companies are learning that golden handcuffs don't have the same power to hook and hold that they used to if employees are unhappy. ""In a pandemic, people are thinking hard about their careers and where they want to spend their time and the kind of culture they want to be a part of,"" says Stromberg. As an employer, the asset manager has been focused on ""how can T Rowe conduct itself in a way that people want to be a part of it?"" The company is so well-known for its congenial office culture that it is colloquially referred to as T Rowe Nice. On the employer review website Glassdoor, the company has a four-star approval rating (based on a five-point scale where 4 indicates employees are 'satisfied'), and ""T Rowe Nice"" was referenced in more than 75 reviews. The people are nice, and co-workers are supportive, one Glassdoor review noted, before adding: ""The pay is lower than average."" But in an industry where base pay, and generous bonuses, are poised to become an increasing differentiator for firms, T Rowe says it has another formula. ""You're hearing a lot about pay increases to keep people, but the highest pay isn't why people stay, or why people are attracted to firms,"" Stromberg says. This culture, and the team-level support that the company relies on, has been crucial in their efforts to combat employee fatigue. ""People want to be a part of something special and bigger than themselves, something they're proud of.""    The asset manager says it has been expanding and hiring, as candidates from peers are attracted to the company's culture after two years of fraught remote work. ""They want to be a part of a company that ... stands for something. That's the formula,"" Stromberg says. T Rowe's ""nice"" factor has been a deliberate effort by management to both curate and preserve a specific, definable company culture. The asset manager's emphasis is on teamwork, collaboration, long-term thinking, and treating each other with respect. Part of the firm's culture is about maintaining its culture. ""It starts at the top with management and leadership saying that it is important and saying that the culture matters,"" Stromberg says. Business leadership is often preoccupied with change. The asset manager has grown rapidly during this period of turbulence in the sector, roughly doubling its assets under management since 2016. But what is equally important in a rapidly evolving environment, is preserving intangibles like culture. Culture is essential to employee retention, and more fragile than many managers realise. It only takes one bad boss to disenchant a team full of talent. ""Reputations are built very slowly over time, but they can deteriorate very quickly if management doesn't walk the walk,"" he says. Good culture does not happen by accident. If companies want a special culture, Stromberg says, that requires ""hiring with culture in mind, promoting people with culture in mind, and firing people with culture in mind"". Protecting culture also involves a clear example at the executive level; it is not enough to lay out guidelines and then try to enforce them. Transparency, honesty and regular communication from the top offices are essential, he says, especially during the pandemic when remote work has complicated office communication. ""It's difficult to overstate the importance of communication and being straight and honest with [staff],"" Stromberg says. ""If they wonder if management is true to the culture, it's a problem."" T Rowe proved itself an early identifier of growth tech, investing in companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox before their public offerings. But it has been criticised for being reluctant to jump on trends, such as ESG now a defining movement within the asset management industry and tapping into international markets. Stromberg says he wishes he had grown his international footprint earlier, and more deliberately. Though, after such a long tenure in the industry, if he could guide his younger self starting out in asset management, Stromberg says that ""the main piece of advice I would give myself is to forgive myself for mistakes I made along the way."" Making mistakes is part of being an investor, he says, fear of making missteps caused him to be more risk averse early on. ""I was putting myself in the penalty box ... all investors make mistakes. The key is to learn from them."" Cost pressures and unpredictable markets have made the jobs, and bottom lines, of large asset managers much more difficult to manage, and these challenges are ongoing. In 2021 Stromberg led the asset manager through its first big acquisition, of alternatives house Oak Hill Advisors for $4.2bn, in order to diversify T Rowe's revenue stream beyond mutual funds. This pace of change will continue, Stromberg says. But, reflective again, he says if he could advise himself at the start of his term as chief executive, a tenure defined by relentless change, he would say: ""Assume people can handle a lot more change than they think they can."" It helps if you have a strong culture as a foundation, he says. Stromberg's successor, Rob Sharps, is also a veteran of the asset manager. For the outgoing chief executive of T Rowe, it is perhaps telling that Stromberg says he would like to be remembered first as a good investor who delivered value to his clients. A close second, he wants to be remembered as a good teammate. Though it is not possible to complete every task you set out to do before you ""exit the stage"", he says. ""The one thing you have to do is make sure there is a strong team in place behind you, and I feel confident in the team I'm leaving behind."" 'Reputations are built very slowly, but can deteriorate quickly if management doesn't walk the walk'"
5f72d5a73676c0548c9b,2022-01-15,Unilever has good reason to want a Hellmann's rethink,"Terry Smith has mayo on his mind, and presumably on his sandwiches and salads. The investor is annoyed that Unilever's management spends its time pondering the ""purpose"" of Hellmann's mayonnaise instead of making more money. You can see why Smith is upset. His Fundsmith platform has delivered stellar returns to retail investors. But a long streak of outperformance was broken last year thanks to a handful of weak stocks. Unilever, where Fundsmith is the 10th-biggest shareholder, was one of the culprits. Smith complained in his annual letter this week that management was ""obsessed with publicly displaying sustainability credentials at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals"". The broadside drew attention because it is so rare for an investor to challenge a company's focus on environmental, social and governance standards. Institutions such as BlackRock are cheerleaders for ESG. Even hardernosed hedge funds find it convenient to play along. Elliott Management, not known for tree-hugging or guff, last month pressed for a break-up of Scottish energy group SSE to ""attract more ESG capital from active and passive investors alike, consistent with the COP26 target to mobilise international finance to support those on the forefront of today's energy transition"". Such monomania is unhealthy. The evangelists ignore the fact that US companies with high ESG scores performed worse than lower-rated companies last year, according to Credit Suisse research. Vocal sceptics, though, are thin on the ground. One of the few to bet against ESG is hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, who sees profits in areas such as palm oil, aluminium and North Sea oilfields. ""The fun is everywhere,"" says Odey. ""The non-fun is trying to work out how ESG is BP relative to Shell."" All the same, you can believe that ESG is overhyped, that good assets are being needlessly discarded, that management time is wasted on sustainability initiatives, yet still find merit in Unilever's quest for brands with purpose. Smith's mayo missile ""a company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann's mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot"" missed its mark. Smith notes that the Hellmann's brand has endured since 1913. But other equally venerable brands have fallen by the wayside. Kraft Heinz's Velveeta cheese is more than 100 years old but is no longer flavour of the month with more health-conscious consumers. Unilever's high-fat condiment is under similar threat. Mayo sales fell 13.8 per cent in the US last year, according to data from Euromonitor International. Not only is the healthiness under scrutiny but millennials and zoomers are shunning it in favour of ""seven sorts of salsa, kimchi, wasabi, relishes of every ilk and hue"", as one magazine article put it, worrying about the relative rise of ""identity condiments"". Mayo is too basic. So is Smith's critique. It is not a distraction for Unilever to market mayo in different ways, adding flavours and, yes, selling it as sustainable: a way to avoid food waste by pepping up leftovers.    In consumer brands, as in investing, past performance is no guarantee of future success. tom.braithwaite@ft.com 'Identity' foods that are on the rise include 'seven sorts of salsa, kimchi, wasabi, relishes of every ilk and hue'"
db5edb930f9b89cbcda2,2022-01-15,Warning to carbon emitters,"The world's largest carbonemitting companies must disclose more specifics about their transition plans this year or face opposition to individual board members, State Street Global Advisors said in an annual letter to companies. The US investment management group said it would push the largest emitters in oil, gas, utilities and mining to disclose carbon-weaning strategies and funding for this transition among other specifics. Failure to do enough would prompt State Street to consider voting against certain board directors in 2023, the asset manager said. With more than $3tn of assets under management, State Street is one of the giant investors that have become gatekeepers for companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. In an interview with Moral Money, State Street chief executive Cyrus Taraporevala said one of the big problems his firm could address this year would be encouraging a transition from ""dark brown"" assets such as coal to natural gas. ""We want to be supportive of the fact that they don't need to dump all of their brown assets tomorrow morning,"" Taraporevala said. ""We don't believe in the simplistic 'green is good and brown is bad',"" he said. State Street also has an eye on gender equity. The firm will again push companies to add women to boards. Beginning in 2023, State Street said it wanted big companies in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia to have at least 30 per cent women directors. Taraporevala also responded to criticisms that US asset managers did not support ESG shareholder proposals as much as Europeans. ""Look at it over multiple years,"" he said of SSGA's voting, arguing that US groups were making rapid progress. ESG pressures from State Street and other large asset managers underscore that boards can no longer shrug off shareholder petitions and have companies scrambling to get ahead of potential investor scrutiny.

1601a6ac80e40729c463,2022-01-14,Big business should do more on the 'social' in ESG,"I t is news to no one that UK business big business at least has had a difficult few years in terms of the zeitgeist. You can argue whether the vote to leave the EU, when business almost universally pointed in one direction and the decision went the other, was symptom or cause. In all likelihood, both. But the acrimony since hasn't helped. The pandemic prompted a crisis-time rallying-round that improved the standing of large corporations in polling, along with other national institutions. But that is a distant memory. A government trying to push through tax rises has concluded that the most painless way to do that is on business. The energy crisis could mean windfall taxes on oil and gas producers. Big housebuilders are on the hook for the cladding crisis. When a combination of Brexit and Covid-19 created serious labour shortages, it was business that was standing in the way of a higherwage, higher-productivity economy at least according to the government. Perhaps, then, it's no surprise that a readout of the public's view isn't exactly glowing. Research from Hanbury Strategy and Stack Data Strategy, published this week, found that 56 per cent of those asked thought business was ""out of touch"". When choosing what best described British businesses, the 2,000 respondents went for statements such as ""trying their best in a difficult time"" and ""care only about making money"" in four times the numbers that sentiments such as ""share my values"" or ""making the world a better place"" received. The prescription from Hanbury, founded by former Vote Leave communications director Paul Stephenson, is to focus more on the basics, such as producing better goods and services and looking after employees. Talking more about those would better reflect the public's priorities, the research said, as opposed to environmental, social and governance issues. There is a tinge of anti-wokery sentiment to the findings. But still, this sounds like a challenge to companies and what my colleague Robert Armstrong calls the ESG industrial complex alike. If the professionalisation and financialisation of what amounts to asking companies to do the right thing has resulted in something that doesn't very obviously include treating your staff well, then everyone has a problem. See fund manager Terry Smith's criticism of Unilever this week: purpose-driven mayonnaise isn't a ridiculous idea but it is basically meant to result in a product that is more interesting or relevant to customers, or more likely to motivate and retain staff. It's not that the public is only concerned about things that affect them right now; the strong interest in issues around climate change in the Hanbury results shows that. But the results point to a failing within ESG: that the social part gets overlooked, and that investors aren't asking the right questions. Responsible investment campaigner ShareAction found investors are more likely to vote for environmental or governance resolutions than social ones. The group is pushing for better information from companies about their workforces. Its latest data, released this week, received responses from only 173 companies of the 1,000 asked globally. The FTSE 100 does better, with half sending back at least some numbers. Last year, the average completion rate was about 60 per cent.    The charitable interpretation is that companies are too busy treating their employees well to fill in endless forms. This isn't entirely baseless: about half the blue-chip index are accredited Living Wage employers, and only about 55 per cent of them contribute to the ShareAction disclosure initiative. But which questions companies choose to answer is also revealing. The best response rates in the past were on governance issues such as board responsibilities and policy statements, unlikely to capture the public imagination. The spirit of openness doesn't extend as much to the nitty gritty of pay, conditions or safety. Staff turnover appears a closely guarded secret, says Share- Action's Rosie Mackenzie. And in other areas, such as who works in the supply chain and where, companies simply aren't collecting the basic data, she says. Businesses should know more and talk more about their people. And ESG investing, done properly, should be part and parcel of that. helen.thomas@ft.com; @helentbiz Investors are more likely to vote for environmental or governance resolutions than social ones"
fecd241b1755227b3f25,2022-01-11,Don't let sustainability skew other ESG priorities,"Letters The article by Patrick Temple-West and others ""Eight essential ESG Topics for 2022"" (Moral Money, FT.com, January 5) reinforces a perspective that is undermining meaningful progress towards sustainability. Sustainability cannot continue to be seen as an aggregate of predominantly climate change issues peppered with some limited social and governance themes. Sustainability is about an integrated understanding of the full impacts of business activity on people and the environment. So what does this mean for the eight essential environmental, social and governance topics? The so-called ""Scope 3 emissions"" principle does not just apply to carbon emissions. It is the fundamental principle underlying the corporate responsibility to respect human rights. This responsibility applies across a business enterprise's activities and through its products, services and business relationships, including its supply and value chains. The EU's corporate sustainability reporting directive will adopt this approach when requiring companies to identify and report not only on their impacts on climate change but also on their impacts on people and the environment. This means that the principle of double materiality applies beyond climate change and that pressure for companies to adopt a broader view of their footprint on the world will come from more than just new digital tools and influential corporate alliances. Regulation will impose it. With this understanding, the ""S"" needs to be seen as critical to ESG and applies to far more than employment issues such as safety, diversity and unionising. It covers the full spectrum of potential negative impacts on people and communities. Beyond employment activism, business needs to focus on managing the adverse impacts of ""clean"" energies and low carbon technologies that utilise supply chains steeped in forced labour and child labour, produce toxic e-waste that typically ends up in developing countries, and involve mining operations that are rife with human rights violations and destructive impacts on communities. Without addressing the full range of interrelated impacts of business activities on people and the environment, we will not achieve meaningful change. Andrea Saldarriaga Paris, France"
619f3dff349e3468dcc3,2022-01-11,Impax: it has the wind behind it,"Twitter: @FTLex Impax Asset Management gives new meaning to the word sustainable. A decade ago, it managed £1.9bn of client assets, part of a select group of fund managers specialising in this area. That figure has swelled to £41.4bn as of its latest trading update yesterday. In an arena filled with copycat environmentally responsible funds, public equity-focused Impax stands out. The company's long history and strong distributional networks have deservedly plumped up its valuation. Listed on the smaller AIM market since 2001, Impax has combined early distributional deals involving BNP Paribas and St James's Place with a sensible US acquisition. It bought Pax World Management in 2018, an unrelated business with an even longer history in sustainable investment stretching back to the 1970s. It is the distribution deals that have made the difference. A surge in assets coupled with a lag in hiring helped boost profitability. Its operating margin leapt more than 12 percentage points in the year to September to a record 39 per cent. Impax has hit its sweet spot. Equity performance over three and five years has mostly beaten broad world benchmarks. Yes, the weight of so much new money throughout the industry splashing into this style of investing would lift most boats due to market performance. But Impax's rise in assets under management reflects net inflows too. In the year to September 2021, these made up nearly two-thirds of a £17.2bn rise in client assets. Any investors hoping that Impax gets gobbled up by a larger group may not get their wish soon. On 30 times forward earnings its shares trade well above the 15 times average of local niche managers such as Liontrust. With market value exceeding 4.5 per cent of client assets, holders will need the ESG wave to crest higher. Today's news suggests that is a credible assumption."
9a8b41649cc18e40667e,2022-01-08,My 14 years of investment hits and misses,"A s one gets older, one's recollection of past events and dates blurs. But November 2007 stands out for me the month I published my first Adventurous Investor column. Fourteen years on, I'm still here on the frontiers of investing, kicking the tyres on the latest exotic ideas in the industry. In an early column I questioned whether fund managers were guilty of constantly ""alighting on some weird and wonderful 'new' idea, taking a quick punt and then running to the next 'big thing'"". But can that charge also be laid at my door? During the pandemic, I have had ample opportunity to do some digging to see how my adventurous ideas have fared over the years. I've broken down into winners and losers and what both can tell us about risks and opportunities. First, the misses. My most painful admission is that my love of geographical frontiers especially Africa has been unrewarded. Over the years I've championed funds and stocks such as the Africa Opportunity Fund, Atlas Mara (African banking) and Agriterra (African agriculture) and all have disappointed in their idiosyncratic ways. It is fiendishly difficult in these frontier markets to find well-managed businesses with liquid stock quotes and a good record. And timescales matter. I still think Africa will surprise us in the long term, but a local investment might go nowhere for another decade. I think picking individual countries is dangerous: experience suggests you're much better off sticking with an active fund such as BlackRock Frontiers, which will do all the hard work for you. Another miss has been what one could call uncorrelated, illiquid closed-end funds. The idea was to find funds that invest in esoteric stuff, mostly to generate an income, and which would not move in step with the wider stock market. Lots of names come to mind, probably most notoriously the catastrophe bond specialist CatCo, which crashed and burnt when multiple natural disasters hit the US seaboard states in 2017. The lesson here is that you can find exotic, uncorrelated stuff, but that doesn't make it a good investment. If an unusual sector or strategy will pay you a fat regular dividend cheque, be sure that its business model is robust and those cash flows are reliable. My crystal ball-gazing skills have frequently fallen short. In 2016 I foretold a 15-20 per cent correction for US and UK stock markets as a result of Donald Trump's election win. The following year I highlighted the potential for stem cell technologies particularly via the medium of umbilical cord blood as a way of revolutionising reproduction, with businesses such as China Cord Blood and Widecells as the front runners. The latter is long gone, while the former has seen its share price go nowhere for years. Looking over my columns, one standout has been my love affair with value as a way of investing and my focus on cheap funds. But I've come to realise that buying cheap stuff after a detailed research process is the easy part. Far harder is identifying catalysts that will raise the share price. The idea of buying cheap growth has paid off sometimes. In 2012, for instance, I observed that some of the biggest names in tech, such as Google ($288 at that point) looked reasonable. I still think that applies to some tech titans today.    I've also fervently believed in backing biotech. Again, that's largely paid off. I took a liking early on to an innovative investment trust called Battle against Cancer IT and liked it even more when the Wellcome Foundation's venture capital arm backed into it and turned it into Syncona. The shares have doubled since and in my opinion have much further to go. Another category I continue to favour is the specialist funds spinning out intellectual property (IP) from universities and research labs. I've long championed the IP Group which snapped up another of my favourites, Imperial Innovations. But there are obvious risks. With a collapsing share price, IP spinout Allied Minds should act as warning that not every tech fund can ride the wave. Mercia Asset Management is probably my current favourite in this category. Over the past 13 years I've generally been supportive of investing in emerging markets, even though it's a rollercoaster ride. My favourite vehicle, Schroders Asian Total Return fund, has nearly doubled in price since October 2016. By contrast I've been consistently cautious about China, but I've warmed to the country when valuations crash, as they did in June 2012. Then, I suggested investing in the Fidelity China Special Situations fund. It has subsequently gone up from 75p to 323p a share. Another big win has been my consistent backing for private equity funds, which proved increasingly popular with private investors. I've championed names such as Hg Capital and ICG Enterprise and continue to do so. Infrastructure funds have been another bright spot I gave favourable mentions to the likes of HICL and INPP back in August 2009 when they were still yielding well over 5 per cent. I still think they are a great bond alternative in these uncertain, inflationary times. Honourable mention should go to those left-field, exotic ideas that have paid off. In 2012 I argued that litigation funding and especially Burford (valued at 105p at the time) was worth investigating. Despite its many travails with short sellers, its share price is 786p and I still think, on balance, its model is worth a punt. Talking of punts, my late arrival to the crypto party and my enthusiasm for ethereum looks less embarrassing than it did in 2018, after ethereum's price went up fivefold. This brings me to my last category ideas still at the early stage, prognosis unknown. The most obvious example is my enthusiasm for resource stocks. I've long argued that oil will rebound above $70 and breach $100. That has driven some big wins such as retail bonds issued by companies like Premier Oil and EnQuest when prices hit rock bottom. There have also been some very big duds. Riverstone Energy, a listed private equity energy firm which has been a terrible investment, might now be turning into something more interesting. Funds investing in uranium miners have had a terrible time since the global financial crisis but I think the tide has turned (check out Yellow Cake's rising share price), while the price of carbon accessible through ETFs such as Wisdom Tree and HANetf to me looks to be heading in the right direction. I'm still long Yellow Cake (a uranium holding company), carbon ETFs and US oil companies (currently Diamondback Energy). I should also mention a big theme that has a lot further to run: passive funds. I suggested adventurous types should not only investigate index tracking funds and ETFs but also multi-index fund providers (such as 7IM) and DIY strategies involving lazy portfolios which boast just a handful of ETFs (now commonly provided by online robo advisers). That said, my enthusiasm has been tempered by caution about so-called ""black box"" strategies such as smart beta, which have by and large failed. I think the same is true now for ETFs on the theme of ESG (environmental, social and governance). They are incredibly fashionable, but pose the same risks as the smart beta trend in the last decade. Beware. So should I conclude that the future is drab and boring, comprising unadventurous ETFs in a simple, low-cost indexing portfolio? Yes and no. I think a core portfolio of dull ETFs makes sense alongside a satellite portfolio of adventurous ideas, many in closedend funds. But squeezing decent returns from a ""boring"" portfolio will get harder. We will all need to look at alternatives, whether private equity, emerging markets or digital assets. David Stevenson is an active private investor.

94e56f4a2720d6860e8d,2022-01-08,"'Republican, Democrat ... I'm an oilocrat'","Lunch with the FT Harold Hamm The shale energy pioneer is facing down a green revolution. Over a burger and Diet Coke in his Oklahoma boardroom, the billionaire talks to Derek Brower about the 'religion' of climate change, his fractured friendship with Donald Trump and why it pays to fly your own plane H arold Hamm, billionaire oil tycoon and erstwhile Donald Trump confidant, stands in a crisp suit at the head of a long dark table in a boardroom high up an Oklahoma City skyscraper. Maps, leaflets, ring binders and papers are strewn the length of the table. With sudden alarm, I note they include articles on US energy from the Financial Times. ""Mr Hamm is ready for you very ready,"" his head of communications had told me in the downstairs lobby a few minutes earlier. She wasn't wrong. Hamm is America's most famous oilman: a pioneer of the shale revolution of the past 20 years that made the US the world's biggest oil and gas producer, lessening its dependence on Middle Eastern energy and upending geopolitical norms in the process. To legions of fossil-fuel advocates on America's right, Hamm, 76, is the self-made hero of the country's energy renaissance. But with a president in the Oval Office who has promised to ""transition"" from oil, Hamm is now in a battle to defend this legacy and I've driven eight hours from west Texas to Oklahoma City to ask him about it. I had imagined the answers would unfold over plates heaped with barbecued pork, grits, fried okra and other staples of Oklahoma cuisine, maybe in the wood-panelled Petroleum Club, a stone's throw from Hamm's office. Hamm has other plans. A well-built man with a weathered face and sometimes halting speech, he doesn't give off the kind of groomed corporate air emanating from some American executives. Hamm is not into frills. We will eat in the boardroom: a hamburger for him, a chicken club salad for me. Chilled Diet Cokes sit nearby. The papers on the table will be deployed as exhibits as Hamm makes his argument. No rye in sight. The billionaire is living up to his reputation for frugality. Shares in Continental Resources are collectively worth $18.2bn, as of Thursday afternoon. Hamm owns more than 80 per cent of them. It's quite the life change for a man born as the 13th child of a sharecropper in Lexington, Oklahoma, just after the second world war. ""It's something that you fall into gradually,"" he says of his colossal wealth. ""No one knew until we went public"" the listing was in 2007 ""and then it was a big splash, 'Oh he's a billionaire.' Well, no, I'd been a billionaire for quite a while before that."" As a rags-to-riches story it has a bit more to it than the overnight success of an internet start-up. And it has also brought him influence. Trump considered making Hamm his energy secretary and the two spoke frequently, especially when the epic oil crash of 2020 threatened the US shale industry that Hamm helped build. The relationship seems to have soured.    ""Loyalty's a big thing with us it's very necessary with leaders,"" Hamm says. ""And I wish Trump could have been a lot more loyal to his people."" To whom was he disloyal? ""Everyone around him that worked hard."" Hamm may no longer be a Trump fan but he is no admirer of the current president either. The first point he wants to make is about Biden and his vote, as a senator in the late 1970s, for legislation that made coal, the filthiest fossil fuel, a cornerstone of American energy security. The US exported the idea, including to China. These politicians knew of coal's environmental impact ""and still decided to go ahead"", Hamm says, flourishing as evidence some congressional literature he has marked in highlighter pen. ""What happened there set the world on a course of destruction."" What should be done? ""Put some teeth in"" global climate agreements, so coal plants can be closed, Hamm suggests. From a man who once told a Senate committee that he didn't ""believe the science of global warming was proven or settled"", it is a surprising comment. Greta Thunberg would not disagree. But Hamm is, of course, no green advocate. He wants coal replaced with natural gas, which emits less CO2 than coal when it is burnt but still contributes to climate change. It was soaring shale gas output that pushed down American emissions in recent years, Hamm notes, by displacing coal in power generation. ""We're finally getting down here where it was in the 1970s,"" he says, referring to the energy industry's CO2 pollution. He pushes another paper across the table, bearing a line graph to prove it. This brings Hamm to his next thesis. Another paper appears, with the letters EQ and IQ written in large print. The emotional quotient is governing energy policy these days, he says, when what is needed is the intelligence quotient. ""If we don't do something real quick, and realise we got to turn around this emotional deal ... stop the crap and get off the emotional quotient, then we're close to making some huge mistakes,"" Hamm says. A waiter in a suit appears from an anteroom and briskly lays cutlery at the end of the table not covered with documents. Hamm barely pauses. Among the errors, he says, is Biden's strategy favouring renewables, such as wind and solar power, and promoting electric vehicles ""virtue cars"", in Hamm's phrase. Hindering America's mighty oil sector will only end with punishingly high petrol and natural gas prices, and a renewed dependence on Saudi Arabia, Russia and other autocracies, he says. It is a familiar line from an American oil sector that has had a mixed few years. Even as shale pioneers like Hamm cracked how to bust oil and gas from brittle rocks in the past decade, sending US output sharply higher, investors were fleeing a sector that never really turned a profit. Then came 2020's pandemicinduced crash. By April that year, American oil prices had plummeted below zero for the first time. Bankruptcies tore through the sector, and tens of thousands of people were sacked. Shale companies clung on but now Biden is killing off America's precious strategic industry, just as it gets back on its feet, Hamm suggests. ""We have an administration in place that really ... they want to do away with fossil fuels,"" he says. Hamm intends that as a criticism, I reflect, but many Democrat voters would consider it a hopeful mission statement to tackle a climate crisis. It is also more complex. Biden was part of the Obama administration that oversaw a surge in US crude production. Hamm himself successfully lobbied the Obama White House to allow US crude exports. And since Biden entered the Oval Office, oil prices have soared and the shale sector has become consistently profitable for the first time. Production is rising. Continental's market worth has more than doubled. Isn't Hamm just repeating Republican talking points? ""Republican, Democrat ... I'm an oilocrat,"" he says. ""And also I'm a patriot."" Biden's policies will simply be bad for American interests, he claims. And what about Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez and other progressive Democrats? They seek help for poor communities living next to polluting fossil-fuel infrastructure, clean-energy jobs to sustain the economic recovery and an end to costly oil and gas subsidies. Their vision for America is starkly different from Hamm's but AOC is surely also a patriot, right? ""I haven't met her, and I don't know how deep she believes in our country,"" Hamm says. He would be ""glad to talk to her about it"". Maybe sensing my scepticism, an assistant disappears and returns with a personal letter Hamm sent in 2019 to Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and oil-industry critic, inviting her to visit. Trump had mocked    Warren as ""Pocahontas"", a reference to her claim of indigenous ancestry. But the tone of Hamm's letter was gentlemanly and courteous. ""We never heard back, of course,"" Hamm says. ""That's what you get."" The waiter returns and silently places our food in front of us. Hamm is diabetic and the Covid-19 mortality rate is higher for those with the condition a fact that may explain his choice of a modest lunch in the Continental boardroom. But Hamm is not a typical American corporate titan with an Ivy League background or MBA. His geological knowledge was self-taught. He learnt to fly so that he could more easily explore forlorn parts of the American west, making trips up to North Dakota home of the first big shale discoveries he made in his own single-prop plane. ""There was just so much more you could do with an airplane,"" he says, his voice dropping a little and a glint appearing in the eyes. ""You can't travel much, north-south, particularly in the Rockies. Everything goes east-west in America, not north-south. So if you wanted to do business in the Rockies, you better own an airplane."" Some in the oil business who know him say Hamm is touchy about his image. Many Americans know him as the male half of one of the most expensive divorces in history. In 2015, Hamm wrote his ex-wife a cheque for $975m, with the whole tale recounted avidly in the US press. Hamm is not exactly voluble on the topic. It was the ""cheque that went around the world"", is all he says of the money. ""You don't run from it. You just fess up. I am who I am."" And the notion that a man born in rural poverty helped unleash the American shale revolution is, for Hamm, the defining arc of his biography more important to him than his divorce or the calls with the White House. ""Imagine, it took people like myself to pioneer horizontal drilling,"" he says. Not ExxonMobil or Chevron, which initially ignored the shale developments on their own doorstep. ""It came from the little people."" Yet it also depended on Wall Street, which, once risk-takers like Hamm had proved it could work, agreed to finance the shale revolution. Now many of these same financiers are, much to Hamm's annoyance, scrutinising shale companies such as Continental for their environmental, social and governance performance. ""Capitalism is great. It works everybody jumps on the bandwagon and makes a buck,"" Hamm says, referring to Wall Street's ESG trend. ""But you look at the green stuff, it's like an industry on its own."" He doubts it can last. Some of the big asset managers that have tried to use their financial clout to force change, including BlackRock, own stakes in Continental ""and we're proud that they do"", says Hamm. ""But Larry Fink ... he's not going to run away from his money."" BlackRock's boss ""knows"" that fossil fuels will be around for a long time, Hamm says, because renewables like wind and solar are too intermittent to be relied on. The grid failure in Texas during the February 2021 winter storm, in which more than 200 people died, was proof, he says although several studies have attributed the crisis to a failure not of renewables, but of the state's natural gas supply. Climate change has ""almost become a religion"", believes Hamm. ""People tend to go to cults once in a while, but when they wake up, they wake up all of a sudden and realise that you're being led down a path,"" he says. The oil industry's climate denialism has faded in the face of tightening policy, shareholder activism and social pressure. Some of the biggest US oil companies now talk of curbing their CO2 emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement. BP, a huge oil producer, even pledges to reduce its total fossilfuel output over the coming years and pivot to clean energy. Hamm is dismissive. Since BP announced its net zero emissions strategy, the UK supermajor has ""underperformed all their peers"", he says. ""We see those things happen from time to time, that basically companies cut their throat."" A pool of ranch dressing is all that is left of my club chicken salad. Hamm has eaten half his burger. I ask about Trump. Hamm has been a heavy funder of Republicans and deregulation-minded election candidates, especially in fossilfuel states. But he was none too impressed with Trump's refusal to concede defeat after 2020's election. ""I don't agree with a lot of the things he did,"" Hamm says. ""My advice to him was certainly not to ever question voting and go down that route."" Should Trump run again in 2024? ""I don't think he should,"" Hamm says.    The waiter reappears, clearing the plates. Almost three hours have passed. Hamm now offers to show me his rock collection and we retreat to his private office. A window looks on to a taller, shinier skyscraper belonging to Devon Energy, a shale rival that previously occupied the Continental building. I count five different guns mounted in the office. A framed letter from Trump and the cover from a gushing 2014 Forbes magazine piece about Hamm hang on a wall. And then the rocks: chunks of shale, arranged as a lepidopterist might display some prize butterflies. Hamm's eyes shine when he talks about each rock's provenance. He sounds wistful. ""I've never been in it for the money isn't it crazy?"" Hamm and I speak several times by phone after our lunch. On one occasion it is to talk about the new Hamm Institute for American Energy, founded with a $50m donation (half from him, half from Continental). He insists the centre, which sits atop its own wells, will also study renewables and climate not just promote fossil fuels. The institute will trumpet the cause of ""IQ versus EQ"", he reassures me. Other calls come after Biden does something that piques the oilman's fury such as when the White House asks Russia and Saudi Arabia, not US shale producers, to increase oil production to cool petrol prices, which rose steeply through the autumn. ""It's the silliest thing you ever heard of,"" Hamm says, his Oklahoma drawl unmistakable down the line. He had requested a meeting with John Kerry, Biden's international climate tsar, but had had no response. Persuading a climate-concerned world to drop a growing policy shift against fossil fuels just as the effects of global warming become so visible seems a tall order. But Hamm, a man who risked his name and made his fortune defying the naysayers to bust hydrocarbons from brittle North Dakota rocks, is up for the fight. Derek Brower is the FT's US energy editor 'If we don't do something real quick ... stop the crap and get off the emotional quotient, then we're close to making some huge mistakes'"
ebed0bb527ee93ba9361,2022-01-07,Crypto cannot easily be painted green,"an crypto ever be green? C Until recently, this was a question that mostly concerned idealists. The crypto kids who dashed into bitcoin a decade ago were so focused on fomenting an anti-establishment financial revolt that they did not usually worry too much about carbon emissions. The type of mainstream investors who are fretting about environmental, social and governance issues today once avoided digital assets because of other kinds of filth; as a report from ChainAnalysis shows, fraud and cybertheft continues to plague the ecosystem. No longer. As 2022 gets under way, even stodgy asset managers like Fidelity are starting to use crypto to create exchange traded funds. And, as Goldman Sachs pointed out this week in a research note, mainstream investors are increasingly including crypto in portfolios as an inflation hedge, alongside gold. Indeed, Zach Pandl, Goldman's cohead of global FX, rates & EM strategy, reckons that bitcoin already accounts for 20 per cent of the ""store of value"" investment sphere (mostly comprising bitcoin and gold). He projects that if that ratio were to rise to 50 per cent, the bitcoin price would double from its current level to $100,000. However, as Pandl also notes, there is one ""important obstacle"": physical filth. More specifically, the process of ""mining"" bitcoins (ie creating consensus on a shared computing ledger to make a digital asset) requires eye-popping quantities of electricity. Indeed, bitcoin mining now appears to consume more electricity annually than Finland or Belgium, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption index. Kosovo has just banned it for this reason. Worse, most mining has historically taken place in China, which is heavily reliant on coal. Hence that tricky question for mainstream investors fretting about inflation in 2022: can you dabble in crypto without getting your hands dirty in the real world? The short answer is ""yes but not easily"". First, the good news: in 2021 this once-anarchic corner of finance started to organise itself to go greener. Most notably, a coalition of 200-odd crypto entities recently joined forces with the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Coloradobased environmental lobby, to create a Crypto Climate Accord. The accord signatories have apparently agreed to cut the carbon emissions from electricity use to net zero by 2030, partly via carbon offsets but also by switching all blockchain technology to renewable energy sources by 2025 and using energy tracking tools such as socalled green hashtags. Last month, the CCA took a step that would have been unimaginable five years ago. It created an earnest 32-page template on how to conduct the type of credible environmental crypto audits that might reassure a traditional pension fund. Yes, really: the (green) suits have arrived. Meanwhile, the CCA's pious pledges are being given more teeth by two other industry trends. First, the decision by Beijing to clamp down on the industry last year has forced many miners to relocate from China. This is making    crypto less reliant on coal-fired electricity, since many of the new mining operations are choosing to embrace renewable energy sources. Second, industry players are turning to more energy efficient technology for reasons that go beyond just ""being green"". The key issue is that the socalled ""proof of work"" process used to create ledger consensus for bitcoin is too cumbersome to conduct transactions at scale. Many of the newer digital assets such as cardano or solana have therefore embraced a different process, created in 2012, known as ""proof of stake"". Purists argue that PoS might be less secure than PoW. But it is also far less energy intensive. And some digital assets, such as chia, have cut energy usage even more by adopting a ""proof of space and time"" algorithm. Taken together, these moves could further reduce the sector's carbon footprint, particularly since Joe Lubin, a leader in ethereum (the second biggest digital asset) says ethereum will move from PoW to PoS in the coming months. Yet, as Goldman says, obstacles remain. One big problem is that bitcoin remains wedded to PoW consensus, and it accounts for about half of the $2tn crypto universe. Indeed, the Sustainability Fund Monitor suggests, using 2017 data, that bitcoin now accounts for the vast majority of electricity consumption (11 times that of ethereum, for example). A second problem is that the industry is so murky that it remains to be seen how much transparency the CCA can really create, particularly among nonsignatories. Or, as the Sustainable Funds Monitor observes: ""In the end, the lack of transparency and data make it exceedingly difficult to point to any one currency being 'greener' than others."" Finally, basket products created by financial institutions could make the ESG challenge considerably worse by jumbling assets together. Of course, a cynic (or a crypto-enthusiast) might sneer that this problem is no different from that of other asset classes; gold, say, has a dirty carbon footprint too. That is a fair point. But perhaps the key message for investors is this: yes, it might make sense to include crypto as an inflation hedge, but, no, it does not offer a free lunch. Digital gold might be going mainstream, but it has not yet been washed clean of all the dirt. gillian.tett@ft.com Can mainstream investors dabble in digital assets without getting their hands dirty in the real world?"
47988fbde0273d4aa30f,2022-01-06,Backers ride Hertz to paper gains of $3bn,"Travel & leisure. Distress cycle Certares and Knighthead have seized what they think is a big long-term opportunity As travellers face soaring prices to rent cars amid surging demand and a shortage of new vehicles, two little-known investment groups are reaping rewards from one of the hedge fund industry's most lucrative trades of 2021. Certares Management and Knighthead Capital Management are sitting on paper gains of almost $3bn after a $2bn bet in May on Hertz, part of the centuryold car hire pioneer's exit from pandemic-induced bankruptcy. Central to their investment thesis is that the pandemic blow to Hertz is a blip overridden by a longer-term opportunity. The New York investors believe the fleet and network of locations can be redeployed as infrastructure for the electric car industry and the coming era of autonomous taxis. ""There's always one sector that's at the centre of every distressed cycle,"" said Tom Wagner, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs who set up Knighthead in 2008 to invest in distressed assets. ""In this case, it was travel and leisure. If we could get it right, we could get the whole portfolio right."" With this in mind, Knighthead, which manages $8.3bn in assets, and Certares, which specialises in investing in the travel, tourism and hospitality sectors, raised $1.5bn in spring 2020 to invest in the distressed travel sector. They did not have to wait long to put the money to work. When Hertz filed for bankruptcy in May 2020, it was just the kind of opportunity they had in mind. Together the pair embarked on a marathon auction process to take the company out of Chapter 11 administration. When they emerged victorious, they made a $2bn combined investment in Hertz, fuelled by their earlier fundraising and their existing funds. The value of their investment has risen 2.5 times in the seven months since, a standout return for distressed investors that have had few good investment opportunities during a prolonged period in which central bank intervention has propped up equity markets. In November, Knighthead and Certares relisted Hertz on the Nasdaq and sold almost $500m of stock but have maintained a 39 per cent holding in the company, worth $4.5bn. Private equity group Apollo Global, which made a $1.5bn preferred investment in Hertz as part of the bankruptcy auction, redeemed its holding the same month for almost $1.9bn, a gain of more than 25 per cent in just six months. The pandemic continues but the rental car industry's fortunes have reversed, adding momentum to Certares and Knighthead's trade. Hertz is on track to generate more than $2bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year, almost four times its pre-pandemic level, despite a 43 per cent drop in volumes, according to estimates from analysts at JPMorgan. A driver of the profits is the semiconductor shortage that has curtailed production of new cars.    With limited ability to expand fleets, brands such as Hertz and Avis Budget have raised prices to match soaring demand. Average daily car rental prices during the holidays were more than $100 a day in beach destinations such as Hawaii and ski destinations in Colorado, Montana, Utah and Wyoming, according to online travel agency Kayak. The supply chain constraints have led to a surge in prices for used cars, which also helps Hertz's bottom line rental car companies hold large fleets that they sell to used car dealers as they age. Although the group is benefiting from conditions that will fade, Certares and Knighthead believe there is an opportunity to use the profits to refashion Hertz, founded in 1918 to rent out Ford Model T cars, into critical infrastructure for electric vehicles and autonomous taxis. ""In order to make this work, we decided we would have to make a substantial push into electrification,"" said Wagner. ""Hertz has a location within 10 miles of 90 per cent of the US population."" With more than 12,000 sites worldwide, including in most US airports, he said, Hertz could become an electric vehicle hub where travellers rented from carmakers such as Tesla that lacked large dealer networks, showcasing electric vehicles to potential new buyers. Hertz disclosed last year that it had ordered 100,000 Teslas for delivery by the end of 2022, part of a strategy to use its locations as charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. It struck a partnership with Uber that is expected to make 50,000 Teslas available to its drivers by 2023. Hertz's existing locations are critical to the strategy, because building new rental car locations is expensive and burdensome. Its urban locations could be useful for Uber drivers adopting electric vehicles, according to Greg O'Hara, founder of Certares. He said Hertz's outlets would eventually become servicing locations for the cleaning and charging of autonomous-driving taxis. ""This should be one of the best ESG investments,"" O'Hara said. ""It is helping an internal combustion engine company become an electric vehicle company, and a fleet services for autonomous driving company."" In November, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren wrote to Hertz criticising it for raising rental prices and authorising a $2bn stock buyback programme after it sold off cars and laid off thousands during its bankruptcy, leading to complaints from customers. ""The company is happy to reward executives, company insiders and big shareholders while stiffing consumers with record-high rental car costs and ignoring the recent history that nearly wiped out the company,"" she wrote. ""Hertz owes the public an explanation for this corporate greed."" But Wagner and O'Hara see their investment as financing the car industry of the future. ""We have a commitment to electrification,"" said Wagner, and this ""requires investment in vehicles, investment in charging networks and investment in used car partnerships ... You can expect to see those expand, and we're going to be very creative in how we do it.""

5426ec6c645afe988d3e,2022-01-04,South Korean chipmakers ramp up US lobbying drive,"? Groups boost Washington presence ? Export licences for China the target South Korean chipmakers are ramping up their lobbying presence in Washington to navigate US-China tensions and win export licences to supply Chinese companies targeted by trade sanctions. Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group and LG, the country's four biggest conglomerates, are leading the efforts as they bow to pressure from Washington to produce strategically sensitive goods such as semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries in the US. LG will open a lobbying office in Washington next year, after its batterymaking unit LG Energy Solution was embroiled in a multibillion-dollar legal dispute with domestic rival SK Innovation that threatened to disrupt Ford's electric car plans in the US. The Korean groups are seeking export licences to supply US-blacklisted Chinese companies, including technology group Huawei and chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. The US commerce department had granted more than $103bn in export licences to Huawei and SMIC from November 9 2020 to April 2021. ""We are trying to hire Americans with connections to Washington as we need to strengthen networking with the US government and Capitol Hill,"" said an executive at LG Energy Solution. ""We need to respond quickly to the changing global agenda and minimise business risks in global supply chains amid the worsening US-China relations, the changing international trade order and ESG [environmental, social and governance] requirements. We need an effective channel to deliver our stance to Washington."" SK Hynix, the world's second largest memory chipmaker, set up an internal unit last month to manage its US business as it works to complete a $9bn acquisition of Intel's Nand flash memory business. SK E & , the group's energy unit, will open a New York office headed by vicechair Yu Jeong-joon this year after taking over several US energy companies. ""From semiconductors to batteries and hydrogen, US interest in Korean companies is growing sharply,"" said an SK official. ""We will see more executives with overseas business experience move to the US while the group hires more lobbyists for effective communication with Washington."" Samsung Electronics last month appointed a president-level executive for the first time to lead its device solutions business in the US. The move came as the company plans to build a $17bn chip plant in Taylor, Texas. The Korean campaign has coincided with efforts by rival regional chipmakers to increase their US lobbying presence. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's biggest contract chipmaker, has raised its profile in Washington. It is building a $12bn chip factory in Arizona and competing for $52bn in chip subsidies announced by President Joe Biden's administration.    The company hired Nicholas Montella, a former executive at the US Chamber of Commerce, as its government relations director last year and recruited Peter Cleveland, a former top lobbyist at Intel, as vice-president for global policy and legal matters in 2019.

USA Inc and UK plc have swelled their bounty most years, give or take the odd downturn. But stakeholder capitalism, or investing to meet environmental, social and governance standards, implies structural change. Saving the planet endangers profits for Big Oil. Royal Dutch Shell says oil production peaked in 2019. Shell, BP and Exxon have written off tens of billions of dollars on stranded, uneconomic assets. Saudi Aramco, one of the most profitable companies, continues to stake its $39bn of average annual capital expenditure on oil. But its ebitda margins are steadily contracting, from 70 per cent in 2016 to 58 per cent in pre-pandemic 2019. Meanwhile, governments keen to protect citizens and beef up national revenue are targeting the tech industry. Several countries, including the UK, have imposed digital levies that will stay in place until a global tax agreement comes into force. Tech companies no longer have free rein to disrupt society seeking new revenue streams. See Meta's partial retreat from facial recognition. Workers have seen their share of the spoils dwindle for decades. However, changes are afoot. Gig economy problems have prompted legal challenges. Uber claimed prices could double if made subject to a California bill reclassifying some gig workers as employees. A UK Supreme Court ruling granting drivers holiday pay and a minimum wage forced Uber to set aside $600m for historic claims. But to see real change, look at Communist China. Why use taxation to redistribute wealth when you can just commandeer a slice of corporate profit? This year, tech groups, including Alibaba and Pinduoduo, have responded to a regulatory clampdown by ""donating"" profits to charity and promoting the government's ""common prosperity"" drive. Compared to China's crackdowns, ESG's effects seem mild."
b6168b7c8962575d7efb,2021-12-31,The electric vehicle holdouts,"While many of the biggest carmakers have staked their futures on EVs, some companies such as BMW and Stellantis are resisting the rush believing that the transition in the industry will be gradual. By Peter Campbell and Joe Miller F lanked by row after row of the new electric models Toyota plans to release this decade, it appeared that the carmaker's boss Akio Toyoda was preparing to throw the company's full weight behind battery-powered vehicles. After years of promoting hydrogen technology and its own hybrid systems that combine engines and batteries, this seemed to be the moment the Japanese titan finally embraced the EV-mania sweeping the auto industry. But even as it announced a $35bn investment in electric vehicles earlier this month, Toyota was hedging its bets. ""It is difficult to make everyone happy with a one-size-fits-all option,"" Toyoda told investors and spectators at an event in Japan. ""That is why Toyota wants to prepare as many options as possible for our customers around the world."" The company is not alone in believing other options are needed. Over the course of the past year, many of the world's biggest carmakers have gone ""all in"" on electric vehicles. General Motors, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo Cars have set end dates for the sale of any vehicles containing an oldschool engine. Volkswagen, which has pledged to spend €52bn on battery powered cars, has all but ruled out other solutions. With one eye on strict regulations and the other on the dramatic success of Tesla over the past few years, these companies are now preparing for a swift transition to EVs in many of their main markets. Yet others, most notably Toyota, BMW and Stellantis, have shied away from the headlong rush into battery models. Their concern is not the direction of travel all three have plans to sell significant numbers of electric vehicles over the next decade but the speed of the shift, and its wider consequences for society and the climate. While many executives share these concerns behind the scenes, the holdouts are becoming ever more vocal, arguing that policymakers need to take into account emissions from supply chains and power grids when deciding whether battery cars are truly ""green"". Furthermore, although carmakers are agreed that developed areas where regulators are pushing hardest, such as western Europe or China's megacities, will become major electric markets in the space of a decade, they are sceptical that lower income economies will keep pace. Currently, electric vehicles account for just 1 per cent of sales outside of Europe, China and the US, according to Bernstein Research, and countries with patchy power grids will take much, much longer to catch up. This could lead, they believe, to a twotier world where richer countries have transitioned to electric cars but consumers in large parts of the developing world are left driving dirty older cars, or being priced out of private car ownership altogether.    The companies more cautious about EVs also believe that the way the transition in the car industry is handled could have a big impact on the climate. If consumers who could cut emissions by switching to hybrid models in large parts of the world remain in their old cars, the impact will be higher emissions until, by choice or government edict, they eventually move to electric cars. ""If the charging infrastructure isn't there, it doesn't matter how much CO2 would be replaced, customers won't buy it and instead keep their old car for longer,"" Gill Pratt, Toyota's chief scientist, told the FT. German premium brand BMW agrees. ""It is absolutely unrealistic to expect that every customer in the world will have sufficient access to charging infrastructure in 2030,"" says BMW's sales chief Pieter Nota, in a thinly-disguised reference to the date when archrival Mercedes plans to switch to electric-only sales in Europe. ""That's our conviction and that's why it's important to still be able to offer internal combustion engines at that point in time in order to serve these customer needs."" Ultimately, those who remain stubbornly off the battery-car bandwagon share a single concern: a fear that carmakers are being led by regulators too fast down the single technological avenue of battery electric vehicles. Carlos Tavares, the head of Stellantis who has for years been the torchbearer for the industry's cautious wing, often likens carmakers to lightbulb manufacturers as they moved from incandescent bulbs to LED lights. He notes that lowenergy bulbs, an interim step, were once considered the future, but they were fundamentally compromised: inefficient, expensive and dim. Had the bulb-makers of the world been forced by regulators to go ""all in"" on these substandard products, the industry would have collapsed when better technology eventually presented itself. ""We are trying not to predict the future, but to make sure we can be successful whatever the future will be,"" says Toyota's science leader Pratt. 'You need to have options' While regulators claim to be neutral about which technologies replace the combustion engine, in reality the strict timeframes they have set for the reduction of carbon emissions leave carmakers with little choice but to pursue battery car sales. Not only is the cost of hydrogen and the lack of necessary fuelling infrastructure likely to hold back that technology before 2030, but regulators are pushing for non-electric solutions such as biomethane to be used in other areas of transport. The shipping and trucking sectors, for example, need to go green but cannot rely wholly on batteries due to their relatively heavy weight. ""We don't want to create a race in which the transport modes cannibalise each other in the fight for the same future,"" EU transport commissioner Adina-Ioana Valean told the FT's Global Boardroom summit earlier this month. ""So, for example, I would prefer to see the use of biomethane [go] towards maritime [transport], which does not have other solutions, [rather] than to waste it on the road where we have the solution for the moment."" The holdouts insist they are also urging regulators to look at the bigger emissions picture. BMW, for instance, says it is following a ""holistic approach"" to sustainability that will focus on using more recycled materials in combustion engine models, and ethical sourcing of raw materials. It aims to cut emissions from the supply chain by 60 per cent in real terms, eliminate emissions from its factories, and find ways of reusing car parts at the end of their life. ""Climate friendly mobility is not automatically created through a higher number of electric vehicles on the road,"" says BMW, which has still launched two new battery models the iX and the i4 to cater for the growing market. Toyota makes a similar point when asked why it has not followed others by going ""all in"" on battery cars. ""It depends what you mean by 'all in', if it means reducing carbon, then there's no doubt Toyota is all in,"" says Toyota Europe president Matt Harrison, who notes the company's 20-year bet on hybrid technology has seen it sail past EU CO2 targets ahead of rivals. Earlier this month the Japanese group unveiled 30 new battery models, but still stressed its dedication to other technologies, including hydrogen power.    ""Carlos [Tavares] is a heterodoxical thinker, so are BMW and Toyota,"" says one industry insider who has witnessed the internal struggles in automotive boardrooms as executives wrestle with the question of how to cut emissions responsibly. ""You need to have options, you can't close down options."" However, keeping options open forces carmakers to spread costs across a number of competing technologies at a time when the industry is already forced to shoulder vast investments into new electric systems. The industry plans to spend $330bn on battery electric vehicle technology alone in the next five years, according to calculations from consultancy AlixPartners. The need to consolidate spending was the rationale for the €50bn merger of France's PSA and Fiat Chrysler to create Stellantis, as well as the driving force behind Ford's global alliance with VW. Yet the added costs from developing electric cars will still flow through to electric car prices, which remain stubbornly dearer than their petrol forebears despite falling battery costs. The gap is widest at the lowest end of the market, with the cars that often serve as many drivers' first entry into motoring. ""Electrification brings 50 per cent additional costs ... there is no way we can transfer 50 per cent of [the] additional cost to the final consumer, because most parts of the middle classes will not be able to pay,"" Stellantis boss Tavares told a Reuters conference this month. The Portuguese executive previously warned that pricing people out of private vehicle ownership risked sparking the types of gilets jaunes protests that startled Paris in 2018. Scratch the surface, and even Mercedes agrees that richer buyers will turn electric first. ""I think we're in a good position that our customer profile is perhaps a set of customers that will more easily access charging infrastructure,"" Mercedes-Benz boss Ola Kallenius told the FT. ""So that's why we have set the ambition high."" Some of the most vocal criticism of the rapid push into EVs has come from suppliers, some of whom face possible extermination if the industry does fully transition to battery models. Privately owned Bosch, which makes engines for many auto brands, appealed directly to politicians to tone down their electric-only rhetoric. ""Modern diesel engines no longer have higher [nitrogen oxide tailpipe] emissions than other vehicles, and particulate emissions for the gasoline engines has been decreased by the factor of 100,"" Bosch's chief executive Volkmar Denner said in February. ""This would have been impossible if we had stopped investing in these technologies."" However, many environmental groups are not convinced by these arguments. ""The likes of Bosch and BMW refuse to see the writing on the wall that there is no future for combustion vehicles,"" says Julia Poliscanova, a director at environmental research group Transport & Environment. She says clean fuel technology and hybrid vehicles are merely ""an attempt to prolong the life of the dying industry"", adding: ""The problem is that the planet can't afford such detours. Policymakers must set stricter emission rules this decade to avoid the unnecessary carbon pollution from such laggards."" As the industry debates how quickly to move to EVs, some analysts believe one of the dividing lines is the differing ownership structures of companies. While the Ford family, led by environmentalist Bill Ford, has backed ending the sale of polluting cars by 2040, in general the family-backed groups tend to be more cautious. BMW, whose anchor shareholder the Quandt and Klatten families own as much as 46 per cent of the company, is under less pressure to convince investors of its plans than many of its listed rivals. Toyota is still run by Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the founder, while the Agnelli and Peugeot families stand behind Stellantis. This has led to some speculation that part of the reason for GM and Daimler to be so vocal about their ambitions is an attempt to garner some of the EV stardust that has propelled Tesla's value to more than $1tn, and seen the market values of sales-less start-ups Rivian and Lucid soar ahead of established names such as Ford and Renault. ""There is definitely a PR exercise at Mercedes and GM that we need to discount,"" says Philippe Houchois, an automotive analyst at Jefferies.    ""It could be that a [share] re-rating is what they need they are not protected by a family or a state."" He adds that companies that have significantly reduced emissions from their vehicles often get overlooked by investors unless they embrace the accepted narrative. ""Toyota has done more for EU emissions in the last five years than any of the others [by selling hybrids], but the market is so obsessed with ESG all-in and not very discriminating when looking at all these issues,"" he adds. The gulf between enthusiasts and holdouts is also thinner than it appears. Mercedes for example, has caveated its 2030 commitment by saying it will be all electric ""where market conditions allow"". Houchois adds: ""The big difference between BMW and Mercedes is BMW says upfront what the problems are Merc says it is 'all in' but you have to look at the fine print"". He adds that the electric sales of both companies in Europe by 2030 are likely to ""be broadly the same"". Share price boost The cynical view, therefore, is that the EV enthusiasts want to boost their share prices in the short-term, while the laggards want to dominate sales of engine cars once their rivals leave the field. Both are slightly unfair, though neither is wholly untrue. Even those who have made the leap are realistic about the barriers that remain. ""We need to have everybody in that transition and transformation that's happening, and we need to make sure nobody is left behind,"" says GM sustainability boss Kristen Siemen. ""And that, you know, for us means having a range of products across all segments and price points. It's about ensuring infrastructure is available in all areas."" The company's two largest markets are the US and China, neither of which signed the COP26 pledge to end polluting vehicle sales by 2035, and which both face vast challenges in ensuring widespread adoption of EVs. Nor is GM completely turning its back on engine improvements during the technology's twilight years. ""We're going to continue to develop fuel-saving technologies and more efficient solutions,"" says Siemen. ""The policies need to be there in order to achieve customer acceptance. But we're going to do everything we can and continue to work with those partners to make it happen."" The likes of Bosch say their continued development of combustion engine technology plays a pivotal, if unglamorous, role in fighting climate change. With the vast majority of drivers still sitting behind the wheel of a petrol or diesel car for decades to come, reducing emissions will be as vital as eliminating them from newer models, they argue. ""We need combustion engines. We need to build combustion engines. We need to have them on the road,"" said Denner in February. ""And that's a fact."" Going electric 'brings 50 per cent additional costs. There is no way we can transfer that to the consumer, because most parts of the middle classes will not be able to pay' 'If the charging infrastructure isn't there, it doesn't matter how much CO2 would be replaced, customers won't buy it and instead keep their old car for longer'"

Equity-focused funds growing fast More than $1tn in cash has poured into the exchange traded fund industry in 2021, with equity-focused ETFs attracting strong inflows in the closing weeks of the year even as concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant weigh on investor confidence. Net global inflows into ETFs (funds and products) had reached $1.14tn by the end of November, compared with the record annual haul of $762.8bn gathered over the whole of 2020, according to ETFGI, a London-based data consultancy. The inflows took global ETF assets under management to $9.92tn at the end of the month, meaning the figure is likely to surge beyond the $10tn mark for the first time in December. Previous Decembers have often provided some of the strongest months on record for new business for ETF providers, particularly when the US stock market has rallied into the end of the year. ""As well as record inflows for ETFs listed in both the US and Europe, we have seen record inflows in newer categories such as actively managed ETFs and with environmental, social and governance [ESG] ETFs,"" said Deborah Fuhr, founder of ETFGI. Actively managed ETFs have registered net inflows of $126bn in the first 11 months of 2021, compared with the $91.1bn gathered last year. New business for ESG-focused ETFs has reached $146.8bn following 2020's record annual haul of $86.9bn. BlackRock, the largest asset manager, is forecasting that global ETF assets will reach $15tn as early as the end of 2025. Salim Ramji, global head of iShares and index investments at BlackRock, said the growth of commission-free trading for ETFs on digital investment platforms had accelerated the adoption of ETFs. ""Hundreds of millions of people globally can now access ETFs commissionfree across major investment platforms in over a dozen countries, often with a few taps on a smartphone,"" said Ramji. Growth of interest in ETFs has accelerated since late March 2020 after the turmoil triggered by the coronavirus pandemic forced the Federal Reserve and other leading central banks to pump liquidity into financial markets via vast asset purchase programmes. The extraordinary support measures by the Fed and a vigorous rebound in US corporate earnings as lockdown measures were eased have encouraged more investors to use ETFs. US domestic equity ETFs have registered inflows of about $538bn since markets hit their lows in March 2020, helping to fuel the S&P 500's rally to an all-time high in early December.    Not all observers welcome the swing to ETFs. Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said the huge expansion in assets held in indextracking ETFs was creating problems by pushing up valuations, increasing correlations between individual stocks and distorting returns across the US equity market. He warned that the risks of ""extreme downside outcomes"" were increasing as investors continued to pour money into the US stock market via ETFs. Vanguard, the world's second-largest asset manager, said the US stock market had not been as overvalued since the ""dotcom"" bubble in the early 2000s. 'We have seen records in newer categories such as actively managed ETFs and with [ESG] ETFs'"
4c33bad47cc14084c617,2021-12-29,Another way to create more reliable ESG ratings,"Letters Lex reports that the fund management industry is increasingly concerned about the unreliability of environmental, social and governance ratings (""ESG ratings: altogether different"", Lex, December 18). The article concludes by saying that ESG rating agencies should ""standardise"". Lex also points out that there is a strong correlation between rating agencies when it comes to debt ratings (95 per cent correlation). But these are derived from well accepted financial formulas, whereas ESG ratings (sub-50 per cent correlation) are based on ""opinion and weightings"". A simple example is the oil industry. Many ESG funds have significant holdings in the sector, probably based on their belief that the oil companies will rapidly move to more ""E"" friendly models and not just buy carbon credits and ""green-wash"". Other fund managers will take the view that oil companies have so far to travel that they will avoid their stock entirely. An alternative to creating a standard, is for the agencies to deliver raw data and tools that allow the investor to apply filters and weightings that reflect their view of ESG, and thereby create a personalised investment dashboard. Let us also reflect that ""standardisation"" has led to the explosion of tracker funds all doing very much the same as each other. By allowing investors and fund managers to develop personalised ESG dashboards and filter investment opportunities accordingly, we should end up with a richer investment market than the one that would result from a standard approach to ESG ratings.

Retaining qualified auditors also ""becomes much harder if there's a current of external negativity"", Kevin Ellis, UK chair and senior partner at PwC, told the Financial Times. PwC said its attrition levels for recently qualified auditors were 8 per cent higher than in other parts of its business this year, an increase from a 6 per cent differential in 2020. Only 15 per cent of qualified auditors joining in the next three months were from the UK, with the rest coming from overseas, it added, suggesting difficulty attracting candidates domestically. Auditors have come under fire after they failed to raise the alarm before collapses at companies such as retailer BHS, outsourcer Carillion and café chain Patisserie Valerie. The Big Four accounting firms Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC have been fined £42m in the past three years for audit failures. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, then chair of the House of Commons business select committee, said in 2019 that auditors were ""complicit"" in such company failures and told the firms' bosses ""we can't rely on you to do the right thing"". Sir Jon Thompson, chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, said last month that the Big Four sometimes ""don't run their own business very well"", prompting Ellis to accuse the regulator of inconsistency between public statements and private feedback to PwC. Ellis said: ""Audit still has a 'halo' for entry-level recruits as it's seen as a trusted business training ... However, its attractiveness ... is damaged if the external narrative from politicians and regulators focuses on the negatives rather than its critical importance to the economy, supporting investment decisions and capital market confidence. ""At a time when investors want to assess businesses on climate and other ESG [environmental, social and governance] issues, the audit profession can't afford to lose capacity. We need more auditors, not fewer."" He added that when criticising auditors, it was important to distinguish between cases ""where with hindsight auditors had turned out to be wrong"" and those where there had been ""bad behaviour"" by accounting firms. This would be increasingly important as economic conditions meant more businesses were likely to face strain. ""At some stage you feel there is a wall of insolvencies that is going to come,"" he said. ""If the reaction again is 'where were the auditors?', it doesn't make it any easier to tell a 23-year-old that audit is where you should want to spend the next 25 years of your career.""    Accounting firms have been locked in a battle to recruit auditors as they seek to expand to improve audit quality and capitalise on demand from companies to verify non-financial disclosures in areas such as their climate impact. The FRC has also been expanding, recruiting heavily from the same pool of qualified auditors. Ellis welcomed the FRC's aim to become an ""improvement regulator"", helping firms to improve the quality of their audits instead of focusing primarily on where they had made errors.

She's fighting a lot of things: the clock, the disbelievers, a climate emergency, a slew of evil corporations and an unrelenting virus that will keep her restaurant's doors closed through the new year. I can feel frustration when she talks, taut beneath her words. ""I want to see results,"" she says. ""I feel an urgency. If we don't teach the next generation the values they need to live on the planet together, we will not succeed in addressing climate. And hunger! One in four children is going to have diabetes in this country. It's frightening. We are not addressing that now at school. And we must."" By now, we have been talking for an hour over Zoom. I ask if she feels impatient. Or tired? She sighs. ""Normally, I have a restaurant at my side, who is my best friend,"" she says. ""And I am always connected with this group of people. To not have them for these years, it's very hard on me. The urgency of climate, it's right here. So I'm even more anxious to make this happen than I've ever been."" Waters is 77 and speaks slowly. Her voice sweet and full of hope, the voice of a 1950s starlet has aged, and now it wobbles. ""That puts a lot of pressure on me every time I speak. And I can't quite get to the place I want and be convincing in a virtual way."" On the surface Waters is the platonic ideal of an apple pie, picked from a nearby tree and baked fresh. But beneath the surface, she's a woman on a mission, scrappy and determined. ""I guess I'm somebody who is following her passion, and always has been,"" she says. ""I look back over 50 years, much longer than that, and if I wanted to do something, I just did it."" The Alice Waters story is legendary, and often told. She grew up in New Jersey with a loving mother who cooked her frozen meals. She only liked corn and tomatoes. It took a college year in France, in 1965, for her to fall in love with food. It was her first time abroad, and Waters describes it as a revelation: food tasted different. She would stand in line to buy a hot baguette, smother it in apricot jam and eat it all. En route to class, she'd walk through a food market full of fresh fish and tiny wild strawberries, bursting with flavour, picked from the woods. The food was seasonal, fresh, local and alive When she returned home to Berkeley, a newfound Francophile, the country was changing. The free speech, antiwar and civil rights movements were building. She was cooking for her artist friends Jean-Luc Godard, Francis Ford Coppola but going broke. Her friend, film producer Tom Luddy, encouraged her to start a restaurant. So they found a little house in the neighbourhood. Over the past 50 years she has built a movement from that house, one that broke through its    walls and went global, an institution that chef Daniel Humm recently called ""the most important restaurant in the history of this country"". ""In the beginning, I was looking for taste,"" Waters tells me, about those early years at Chez Panisse. ""I had in my mind the way food tasted in France, and I couldn't find it in this country at that time. So we resorted to backyard gardens."" They began to realise that only organic, local, seasonal farmers could give them that taste. So she bought from them directly, without a middleman, at market price. She didn't make the farmers travel to the city but went directly to them, bought everything they had, built a menu around it and returned with food scraps for compost. It gave the farmers financial security and the restaurant an alternative economy. But Waters also wanted diners to know where their food came from. So Chez Panisse began to list the names of the farms on its menu. That simple move ignited farm-to-table. Waters launched a global style of cooking: simple, hyper-fresh, ingredient-first. She brought the word mesclun (Provençal for a tender green salad) into the American vocabulary. It's been 50 years since Waters opened Chez Panisse, and 25 since she launched her non-profit, the Edible Schoolyard Project, whose goal is to give every American pupil a sustainable, local, school lunch. Now, she is building out her legacy. What can she construct to outlive her? ""I've always wanted to see a model from beginning to end,"" she says. ""It's what I wanted to do at Chez. I wanted to go all the way."" She wanted to buy everything organically. She wanted people to learn a lesson while eating their dinner. Next up is the state of California. She's working closely with the University of California school system, one of the most powerful university systems in the world, with 10 campuses, nearly 300,000 active students and a budget of $41bn. The university system still holds contracts with big food conglomerates such as PepsiCo, but it's also on a path to sustainability at every campus, as ESG goals become increasingly en vogue. Most California farmers are trained on the UC Santa Cruz campus, which teaches regenerative and organic farming. It has an ambitious goal to be carbon neutral by 2025. ""It's like the university is poised,"" she says. ""If we could decide that food was part of carbon neutrality for the whole University of California? Just think of what it would mean."" Waters won't share much more with me yet. But her vision builds on the Chez Panisse model and is inspired by Denmark, a pioneer in sustainable agriculture. (More than 11 per cent of Denmark's farmland is used for organic production, almost double the EU average. Copenhagen is 90 per cent organic.) She's talking about community supported agriculture on a massive scale. Chez Panisse, but for California, and then the country, and then maybe the world. In a culmination of her life's work, Waters is opening her own institute for Edible Education at UC Davis. She wants it to be a happy place, with a kitchen classroom and a garden classroom. She sees demonstrations from chefs from around the world, with practical lessons on building relationships with farmers. A curriculum that changes with the season. A farmer's market next door. But most importantly, she wants you to ""walk in and say, 'Oh, how beautiful!'"" No back of the house. No hidden ugly spaces. Rather, an open kitchen and tables made of recycled wood. Waters cares so much about beauty that, according to my transcript, she says the word beautiful 14 times. In her recent book, she calls aesthetic beauty ""the outcome of care"". ""My daughter feels like I'm impossible sometimes,"" she says, laughing. ""But I want to light that candle on the table. I want that in my everyday life. I don't want to wait for it. I want to make it happen for myself. And everybody can do that for him or herself."" She attempts to define it. ""I'm trying to find the exact word. It's aliveness. It's when you see something there hanging on the tree, and you pick it that ripe fig. And then you taste it! It's that joy."" I ask Waters if she's doing anything else. She can't be, surely.    ""I've always wanted a restaurant in a museum or a beautiful place of education,"" she says. As such, she has just helped to open a new restaurant, Lulu, in the courtyard of the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, with chef David Tanis, ""one of my favourite chefs from Chez Panisse"". She is also writing a cookbook to be published in the spring. In the US, many have publicly tried and failed in the fight against big food conglomerates such as Sysco and Pepsi, which have a strong hold over what public schools serve. She says this cookbook will prove that you actually can buy local, organic food at the same price as the federal reimbursement for school lunches. She knows that, because they test the recipes by buying organic ingredients at retail price. ""That is something that nobody believes because of the indoctrination of the fast food industrial system,"" she says. ""So we think we can't do it, and I'm saying we can."" A few days before meeting Waters, I was at a kitchen table, talking food with my father. Today, he shops at Whole Foods, but he was born in northern Greece toward the end of the second world war and grew up with an ice box instead of a fridge. His mother went to the market for fresh produce every day. He still shops like that, small and often: a few peaches, a few plums. Just enough. I was reading Waters' slow-food manifesto, We Are What We Eat, a persuasive book published this year. It was already affecting my habits. I told him the crux and the Alice Waters story. From the depths of his memory, he unearthed his mother's seasonal bounty: first there were strawberries, then the cherries, then apricots, peaches, watermelons. But there were two breeds of peaches that came twice in the season! The first were more expensive, but the second were sweeter. Winter brought the thick leafy greens, the horta vrasta. He loved each new season, he said, because it came with new foods. We sat there, daydreaming in his memory. Then we looked in the fruit bowl. It was in New England, and we had apples, and the stickers on them said New Zealand. I tell Waters this story. She laughs right through it. ""Exactly,"" she replies. ""Well, you got the book. My life over these years at Chez has been deeply changed by that acceptance of seasonality."" To keep the flavours you love for longer, you just need to prepare, she says. Can applesauce in the fall. Sun-dry tomatoes. Make jam. Smoke fish. In the conclusion to her book, Waters is adamant: ""Let's be clear,"" she writes. ""This is not about regressing to some sort of idealised past. It is not a call to return to some pre-industrial agrarian utopia that never really existed ... there has always been a farm-to-table connection. There has to be, by definition. We all get our food from somewhere, and always have. The only things that have ever changed over time are the answers to the questions of what farm and what table."" When Waters is criticised, it's mostly for being unrealistic. Many think her expectations of us the time, planning and cost of eating slow and organic is just too much. Even more, it is privileged. Elitist. Can applesauce? Smoke fish? Start a garden in that sad plot between your apartment's sidewalk and the street? According to Waters, yes. We just need to learn how, and she wants to teach us. Chef David Chang, of Momofuku fame, explained Waters once like this: ""She's the face of the movement. At the end of the day, everyone is after the same goal: a world where everyone eats well. Alice is providing the ideal. You need someone to provide the utopian concept."" In an old TV segment, an interviewer asks Waters if she's an absolutist. She says that she's not an absolutist, she's an idealist. I ask what it means to be an idealist. ""It means that something can always get better,"" she says. ""I'm just constantly trying to push myself to be incredibly open minded. I cannot be open minded about the purity of food. I insist on it. But the way that it is cooked, and the biodiversity of the world, and the production of food is so immense that how could anybody just stay firmly in one place? ""I can't,"" she says, ""I can't,"" she repeats. Her voice strains, like she's in pain. ""I guess I'm an idealist that is always open to a greater perfection, a greater beauty.""

4836d1b7e7c7239b19f7,2021-12-24,What Dickens and Scrooge can teach us about money,"T he Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol has always been a seasonal favourite among local theatres as a tale that speaks to hard times. As the pandemic continues and living costs soar, it remains popular for Christmas 2021. Productions are appearing around the country, from London's Old Vic to Cornwall's Minack Theatre. A Christmas Carol offers audiences spooky ghosts, comic moments, high drama and the unforgettable figure of Scrooge, the wealthy skinflint who sees the errors of his ways only a moment before it is too late. The story is also a memorable lesson in money, its uses and abuses a lesson that rings as true today as in Dickens's time. This year's inflation worries are likely to nurture our inner Scrooge rather more than in the past few years, with the ghost of Christmas future looking more expensive by the day. So it's a good moment to focus on the old miser's belated realisation that his hoarded money is useless to him and the world around him. The ghost of his dead partner Jacob Marley finally convinces Scrooge that wealth has no value beyond the grave. For the first time in his life he expresses regret for his lack of generosity. Dickens's message is that accumulating wealth for its own sake is not what money is for. Don't save up too much during life, he tells us. Tread the fine line between accumulating enough and spending your money enjoying it or helping our favourite people during our lifetimes. But A Christmas Carol has other, more subtle lessons for our savings and investments. The tale highlights that we have ingrained patterns of behaviour in relation to money. It's not just Scrooge who finds it hard to change, having locked himself into his own world. Bob Cratchit, his long-suffering clerk, stays with his master through misplaced loyalty, despite being grossly underpaid. So while Cratchit and his impoverished family engender sympathy, he is hardly a good role model. We should rather take note of Scrooge's one-time mentor, the jolly Mr Fezziwig. He runs a profitable business, while acting with generosity to his employees, as even Scrooge acknowledges: ""The happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune."" In the modern world, it's not just a matter of being kind and philanthropic. Fezziwig is surely a good example of running a business, or a portfolio, on principled lines. Early ESG, if you like. The strong money theme running through A Christmas Carol and other Dickens novels was inspired by the author's own precarious financial situation. He struggled at times with his own debts, and those of his father.    A Christmas Carol bailed Dickens out of a financial crisis as is eloquently captured in the excellent 2017 family film The Man Who Invented Christmas. Not surprisingly, other Dickens novels are a treasure trove of money quotes. Mr Micawber, who memorably opines on money in David Copperfield, operates on the highly suspect principle of ""something will turn up"". Not a rule to rely on in Victorian times, when creditors could throw a debtor into prison (as they did with Dickens's father). Nor today, despite our social security system, if you want financial security. Mr Micawber's recipe for happiness is perhaps the most cited money quote from Dickens's works: ""Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery."" But this recipe is incomplete: it's all about the here and now. It won't secure a comfortable retirement: there's no savings or inflation-proofing built in. And, to be truly financially safe, you also need an emergency cash fund of perhaps six months' salary. Mr Micawber isn't the only financial expert in David Copperfield. There is the stagecoach driver Mr Barkis, who may be less articulate than Mr Micawber but is no less sharp. ""It was as true ... as turnips is. It was as true ... as taxes is. And nothing's truer than them."" Dickens would surely have been aware that these lines echo Benjamin Franklin's famous gloomy observation: ""Nothing is certain except death and taxes."" This isn't entirely true: taxes were not fixed in stone in the 19th century, as Dickens knew well, since, alongside his literary achievements, he was a prominent tax reformer. Nor is it true today. We have the advantage of the tax-efficient wrappers of individual savings accounts (Isas) and self-invested personal pensions (Sipps), as well as annual capital gains allowances. Use them to the full, I say, and do so now, as you never know when the rules might change. But don't spend too much time worrying about HM Revenue & Customs this Christmas. You might risk following Scrooge with his obsessions. Put aside your statements and your calculator and look for inspiration to Scrooge's nephew Fred. An unfailingly cheerful man, he never gives up on his uncle, inviting him for Christmas, despite the older man's repeated rejections. It is Fred who says: ""And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that Christmas has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!""

Now the energy sector is facing a new kind of activism: from its own shareholders. Over the past year, activist investors have targeted ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, commodity group Glencore and Scottish energy group SSE. Other institutional and retail investors have also pushed for change, voting in higher numbers than ever before for climaterelated resolutions. The investors vary in profile and objectives, but have all tied their campaigns to what they say has been management's failure to plan appropriately for the energy transition. Third Point, the US hedge fund calling for Shell's break-up, said in October that the group had ""too many competing stakeholders"", resulting in ""an incoherent, conflicting set of strategies attempting to appease multiple interests but satisfying none"". Elliott Management has targeted SSE, saying the company has the assets to profit from a low-carbon future but ""continues to disappoint"". The arrival of activist investors in the energy sector at this moment of upheaval was ""no surprise"", says Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal and General Investment Management, the UK's largest asset manager. ""Activists typically turn up after long periods of underperformance when they detect that headwinds are becoming tailwinds and where they see an open door to push on with other investors,"" he said. ""This is an industry which has both allocated capital badly and generated poor shareholder returns for a very long period."" The most successful activist camwith paign of the year was waged against Exxon by tiny US hedge fund Engine No. 1. When it sent its letter to Exxon's board in December 2020, Engine owned 0.02 per cent of the company. Six months later it had secured three board seats with a mandate to prepare Exxon for a future free of fossil fuels. ""We don't really think of ourselves as activists but as active owners,"" founder Christopher James said. ""An activist is typically looking to make change in order to drive short-term returns. An active owner is interested in what owners want."" While such language may be more conciliatory than the typical Wall Street raider, James was deeply critical of most oil and gas majors' plans. ""These companies are aware of the energy transition. They are talking about it; they have a plan. But it's not really a strategy to create value,"" James said. The oil and gas industry disputes this. Big European participants, for example, have all announced energy transition strategies this year, including big investment in renewables, which they say will make them large energy    providers for decades to come. But many investors remain sceptical, and stock market valuations continue to lag behind other industries. ""It is going to be increasingly critical that these businesses are very entrepreneurial and quick to react to political and regulatory changes, and I haven't seen big conglomerates do that effectively,"" said one activist. Energy groups that planned to invest heavily in wind turbines, solar power and electric-vehicle charging while continuing to run oil and gas assets would have to be agile enough to compete with ""pure play"" companies in each of those areas, the investor said. ""That's really hard."" Beyond the existential challenge of the energy transition, the big energy companies are facing an investment community that has fallen out of love with the conglomerate. General Electric in November announced that it would finally divide into three companies, a day after Toshiba, under pressure from activists, said it was also weighing a split. ""These are all 100-year-old companies deciding it is in shareholders' best interest to run some of these businesses dedicated management teams who are free and unrestrained to go off in the right strategic direction,"" said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein. Unlike Third Point, Clint supported Shell's view that it could perform better in the energy transition as an integrated company, but said management had not yet done enough to explain the benefits of integration to investors. ""Investors find it difficult to model [the integrated business] and move on to something simpler."" Environmental shareholder group Follow This is also opposed to Third Point's proposal to split Shell into a legacy oil company and a new gas and low carbon business, which founder Mark van Baal labelled ""short-term activism"" that would not help the fight against climate change. Set up in the Netherlands in 2015 as a platform to help retail investors press oil and gas companies to shift from fossil fuels, Follow This takes a different approach to the multibillion-dollar activists in London and New York. It filed shareholder resolutions last year at Shell, BP, Equinor, Chevron and Phillips 66 to compel each group to set emissions targets compliant with goals of the Paris deal. One of its most successful resolutions, at Shell, received support from 30 per cent of shareholders in May. This year it extended the campaign to four more groups including Exxon and ConocoPhilips. ""Engagement doesn't work. Votes work,"" said van Baal, criticising investors that he said voted with management in the hope of achieving change through dialogue. Such action is not limited to Follow This. In 2021 there were 16 climate-related investor resolutions at FTSE 350 groups, up from five in 2020, according to a survey from Thomson Reuters. Whether rising activism will benefit shareholders remains to be seen. The campaigns at Shell, SSE and Glencore where Bluebell Capital is pushing the trader to spin off its thermal coal business are in their infancy. At Exxon, Engine's directors are in place, but time will tell whether they can change the biggest US oil company from within. ""From a long-term active owner perspective, the activists may or may not be good news,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at Sarasin & Partners. ""It's all about their motivation."" Stansbury also urged caution, while acknowledging that the best activists had an ability to pick out the ""simple things"" that could be done to boost performance. ""If an activist shows up, you need to be sure, as a long-term investor, that they are asking for things that will both generate value for the long term and make the overall ESG impact of the company improve."" Provided the oil and gas majors and other energy groups remain undervalued compared with other sectors, the activists are not going away. ""These aren't strategies that are going to fall by the wayside,"" said Clint. BP was another ""big stock"" that had underperformed. ""BP could be susceptible to a very similar strategy, no question."" 'It is an industry that has allocated capital badly and generated poor returns for a very long period' Entrepreneurship and fast reactions are needed but 'I haven't seen conglomerates do that effectively'"
490d8f920df6f0d7aa28,2021-12-22,The old lessons from gold's new existential crisis,"I n the world of sustainable investing, being dubbed socially useless is a rough result to take. But that was the challenge laid at the door of the gold sector by one of the bestknown mining investors. BlackRock's Evy Hambro suggested this month that the sector had to do a better job in justifying the environmental costs of digging gold out of the ground, given its limited industrial and tech uses. Mining copper, nickel or other battery metals was an easier case to make, he said, given their role in electrification and decarbonisation. You wonder where this ESG investing with a side of value judgment might end. Nearly 60 per cent of annual gold demand comes from central banks or other investors; about a third comes from jewellery where, particularly in emerging economies such as India, it is in effect also used as a store of value. Those mining gem diamonds must be wondering when someone will question if digging holes is worth it for something where an identikit version can be produced in a lab. Why stop at the extractive industries? The luxury goods sector should start thinking about its utility too. All that leather! But the comments hit a nerve because gold is in the midst of something of an existential crisis. Once, it had a reliable tribe willing to evangelise its role as a defence against ghastly governments and feeble fiat. Now, gold bars are an analogue product in a digital world. The World Gold Council can justifiably point out that gold and cryptocurrencies are different and can coexist happily. Gold has a long and relatively stable history in portfolios; it is fundamentally a scarce natural asset but its production and ownership are diverse. No one is suggesting gold investing is a wild west that needs an aggressive, coordinated global regulatory response. The power used in producing cryptocurrencies also means they are not obviously the environmentally friendly option. One estimate puts the carbon intensity of bitcoin mining at 15 times that of gold mining. Unlike some other commodities, the vast majority of gold's emissions come at the mine site, where renewable power plus electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles offer scope for reductions. But still, it is hard to argue that crypto has not encroached on gold's place in the zeitgeist, if not in portfolios. As Hambro put it: ""Gold companies need to describe their relevance in the future."" The kids aren't trading gold on their phones in the classroom. And none of this has been helped by a year where the world went nuts about inflation, and gold traded solidly sideways. One option something Hambro advocates is to try to bring gold into the digital era and make its rather symbolic position as a means of exchange far more explicit. This is, says the industry, something that is happening in Asia, where gold in digital form is well understood and used. The other argument the industry falls back on is that gold has a social role, one that is under-appreciated and that crypto lacks. Much gold mining happens in remote regions of developing countries. The World Gold Council says its members (only a portion of the sector) employ close to 200,000 people with a further 1.2m jobs through local suppliers; it estimates that more than 60 per cent of the value of gold mined stays in the same country in one form or another. There is some irony in seeking refuge in an area where the mining sector as a whole has long taken    flack: its relationship with communities and its contribution to developing economies, particularly in terms of higher-paid jobs and in-country processing or refining. The official line is that the industry needs to explain what it does better. Privately, some miners and investors concede that certain practices, such as stability deals, which lock in tax advantages or trade concessions, or excessive use of expat labour become harder to justify in a world where the sector is being more exactingly judged on its ability to leave a lasting economic and social legacy in the places it operates. In other words, the response to a crypto-climate-inspired existential crisis in the gold sector could be for miners to do more of what they should have been doing anyway. helen.thomas@ft.com It is hard to argue that crypto has not encroached on the place of gold in the zeitgeist, if not in portfolios"
e8e37937536bbb427f37,2021-12-22,Schroders bets £358m on renewable energy backer Greencoat,"Financials London-based fund manager Schroders has confirmed the £358m acquisition of a 75 per cent stake in Greencoat Capital, one of Europe's largest renewable infrastructure managers. The move marks the latest example of dealmaking in the asset management industry and will help Schroders take advantage of two of the sector's biggest trends: greater demand for renewable energy assets and the expansion of the private capital sector. Greencoat was set up in 2009 by its four founder-owners Laurence Fumagalli, Bertrand Gautier, Stephen Lilley and Richard Nourse. It has grown quickly since then, with assets under management rising at about 50 per cent a year for the past four years to stand at £6.7bn. It has investments in areas such as wind, solar and bioenergy at 200 sites in the UK, Europe and the US. ""This is a deal which is at the cross section of everything that is important to us strategically: private markets, the transition to net zero and clients wanting more sustainable assets,"" Schroders chief executive Peter Harrison said on a call with reporters. ""The big prize is expanding the business further in the UK, Europe and the US."" The purchase price could rise by another £120m if financial targets are met. Schroders has an option to buy the remaining 25 per cent of the company. Schroders, which has more than £700bn in assets under management, has been building out its private assets platform and its position in sustainability. In July, alongside early-stage venture capital firm Oxford Sciences Innovation, it bought a minority stake in Natural Capital Research, a research organisation that helps its clients develop ESG, biodiversity and net zero strategies. The private capital industry reached $7.4tn at the end of 2020, and is set to hit $13tn by 2025, according to Morgan Stanley, as investors search for returns in a low-interest-rate environment. Meanwhile mainstream asset managers globally have been striking deals to expand in alternative investments, attracted by having longer-duration assets and the higher fees these strategies typically command. ""Dealmaking is accelerating as asset managers look to tap into fast-growing areas with high barriers to entry, such as private assets, or expand their distribution into new markets,"" said Vincent Bounie at Fenchurch Advisory. The US and European markets for renewable energy assets are forecast to grow by more than $1tn to 2030 as part of the global transition to net zero. Greencoat's investor mandates typically comprise permanent or 25-year capital, reflecting the longevity of the assets in which it invests. Georg Wunderlin, global head of private assets at Schroders, said on the call that ""the duration of the capital leads to very attractive economics for us a firm ... the opportunity for this business is to continue to grow rapidly"".

278d1b8277108b696579,2021-12-18,ESG ratings: altogether different,"For all its fast growth andmultibilliondollar inflows, environmentally conscious funds harbour a dirty little secret: companies' ESG scores are less reliable than they appear. Norges Bank Investment Management., which oversees a charttopping $1.4tn portfolio, is the latest to blow cover. ""We rarely, if ever, use the ratings numbers,"" Patrick du Plessis, global head of riskmonitoring, told Bloomberg in an interview. This is big business. ESG funds are among the fastest-growing. ESG rating agencies proliferated until consolidation took over a few years back. In 2019Moody's bought industry pioneer Vigeo Eiris. Yet there is. little agreement around methodologies, weightings and other inputs when it comes to ranking companies'. that's laid bare by a recent analysis of six ESG rating providers' scores of 400 companies. MSCI's correlation with S&P and Sustainalyticsthree big providers of ESG ratingswas sub-50 per cent. By comparison, the big three Credit rating agencies have correlations of 94-96 per cent on long-term debt ratings. Academic studies have shown a similar pattern of conflicting ratings due to methodologies, measurement or aggregation. Such discrepancies bring problems for fund managers, companies and the planet mixed signals mean it is far harder to up your game. One suggested solution is for fund managers to apply their own weighting: those deeply concerned with child labour, for instance, can put a bigger weighting on that. But there should be consistency across sectors on how carbon emissions, say, are measured and weighted in the absence of companies providing the information. Alternatively, portfolio managers can follow NBIM's lead and do their own work. But that is unlikely to be an option for smaller, less well-resourced houses. Better for the ESG rating agencies to standardise."
cfc7cc7642e212a1b3f3,2021-12-18,US asset managers lag behind Europe on ESG,"The world's biggest money managers have talked an impressive game when it comes to their environmental and social impact. But in using their votes to drive action, there is a marked transatlantic divide. That is a finding of a new report from London-based non-profit group ShareAction, which studied how 65 of the largest US and European asset managers handled shareholder votes on environmental and social issues. European asset managers voted in favour of nearly twothirds of these proposals, on average. Their US counterparts backed 39 per cent of such proposals. And the rate of support among the world's six biggest asset managers all in the US was even lower than the national average. ""Power not used is power abused,"" Catherine Howarth, ShareAction's chief executive, told Moral Money. ""The world is entitled to expect better of institutions that control this share of the votes."" Some individual asset managers showed rapid changes in voting behaviour since last year. Credit Suisse Asset Management backed just 16 per cent of ESG resolutions in 2020; this year that shot up to above three-quarters.

640b3580d83d81e1af31,2021-12-17,TPG joins the line of private equity groups going public,"? Texas firm manages $109bn in assets ? IPO is fruition of decade-long process TPG, one of the world's largest buyout firms, has filed to go public, the latest private equity group to have sought to capitalise on soaring valuations by listing its shares on the stock market. The Texas group, which has $109bn in assets under management, joins the likes of Blackstone, KKR and Apollo firms once known for disrupting global finance that have become increasingly institutionalised and tapped public investors to fund their growth. TPG's prospective initial public offering comes after a decade-long process of trying to list. Founded in 1992 by billionaires David Bonderman and Jim Coulter, TPG is one of the last large-scale buyout groups to remain private, although its assets under management are a fraction of its publicly listed rivals. After a lukewarm initial reception on public markets, buyout groups have seen their share prices soar in recent years, with Blackstone and KKR more than tripling in value since the beginning of 2019, encouraging a wave of public listings that includes Sweden's EQT Partners and the UK's Bridgepoint. Bonderman and Coulter had been colleagues working for the Bass family in Texas. The pair had led the buyout from bankruptcy of Continental Airlines, nursing it back to profitability and pulling off one of the legendary trades in the history of private equity. The two launched what was first called Texas Pacific Group, shortly thereafter. The financial crisis took its toll on the firm as huge bets resulted in some of the industry's biggest stumbles, including on deals for Texas utility Energy Future Holdings and casino empire Caesars Entertainment, as well as the rescue of a bank, Washington Mutual. However, in recent years the firm has expanded, building a large property business with publicly traded investment platforms. Its private equity bets centred on healthcare and technology groups, such as Par Pharmaceuticals and McAfee, which have paid off. Early-stage ""growth capital"" investments in the likes of Airbnb and Uber have also proved highly lucrative. The firm was a first mover in socially responsible investments, building the buyout industry's first multibillion-dollar ESG fund, called TPG Rise, which manages $12.6bn in assets. Assets under management have risen from $60bn in 2016 to $109bn. Rising financial markets have helped TPG record soaring profits. Total revenues this year have been nearly $4bn and profits stand at more than $1.7bn, it said in its prospectus. In 2020 and 2021, Bonderman received a combined $163m in distributions, largely from carried interest in TPG funds, while Coulter made over $200m. The offering is also part of a succession plan designed to take TPG from a privately held partnership into a fully independent public corporation within five years of its listing. As part of the offering, former Goldman Sachs executive Jon Winkelried, who joined TPG in 2015 and was named sole chief executive in May 2021, will be added to a group of controlling investors that includes Bonderman and Coulter. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to purchase equity from existing owners of the firm, TPG said, though none of the selling shareholders will be a current partner or founder.    Revenues this year have neared $4bn and profits stand at more than $1.7bn, the prospectus states"
7742031213d98580df06,2021-12-17,S Korean businesses in Myanmar talks,"Economic dialogue Yangon meeting takes place despite Seoul's condemnation of coup South Korea's embassy in Myanmar organised a high-level meeting last month between civil servants of the military government and Korean companies including units of Samsung and LG, according to documents seen by the Financial Times. The meeting took place despite condemnation from the government of President Moon Jae-in, a human rights lawyer, of Myanmar's February coup and violence against protesters. Civil society groups and institutional investors opposed to the junta have urged international businesses to isolate the regime, and many foreign businesspeople still active in the country have avoided events that might bring them into contact with junta officials. the US, EU and UK have imposed sanctions targeting military-linked companies and individuals since the toppling of Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government. Participants at the ""Dialogue for Economic Cooperation between Team Korea and Myanmar"" included the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration , a government agency, the United Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a lobby group representing the private sector in dealings with the government, and the Korean chamber of commerce. The event was also attended by executives representing units of Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and steelmaker Posco, according to documents seen by the FT. Tin Tun Naing, finance minister in the parallel National Unity Government formed by supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi, said he was aware of recent meetings involving foreign investors and the UMFCCI and DICA, the latter of which he described as ""junta-controlled"". ""No amount of creative writing could make the case that shaking the junta's blood-soaked hands is consistent with good ESG [environmental, social and governance] practice,"" he said. ""We ask foreign businesses to exercise their good business sense and do no business with the regime."" Since the coup, the junta has "" arrested almost 11,000 people and killed more than 1,300, including children, accoring toAssistance Association of Political Prisoners, a human rights group. The meeting was held at the Lotte Hotel in Yangon, controlled by Posco. Posco International confirmed to the FT that the company had participated in the meeting to discuss ""difficulties that our business is undergoing"", and that it ""had not made any new business contracts since the coup"". ""The business of Posco International has no ties to Myanmar's military junta,"" the company said.    LG told the FT it could not confirm if it had been represented at the November meeting. Samsung and the South Korean embassy in Yangon did not respond to requests for comment. The South Korean foreign ministry told the FT: ""From the beginning of the Myanmar situation, the Korean government has consistently called for an end to violence against civilians, the release of detained persons and the restoration of democracy in Myanmar, and is in the position of actively supporting Asean's efforts to restore peace, stability and democracy in Myanmar.""

68603129b5ca4ae61a26,2021-12-17,Drive to save power needs reboot,"A surge in investment is required to cut waste and carbon emissions, writes Harry Dempsey O ne of the world's most powerful tools for combating climate change is also one of the most overlooked: energy efficiency. While it does not grab the headlines, every incremental effort to reduce energy consumption is vital if the world is to hit the Paris Agreement's target of keeping global warming below 1.5C. The potential of energy efficiency measures to cut emissions is undeniable. However, a report last month on recent progress in rolling out energysaving measures, published by the International Energy Agency, is damning. It found that global improvements have been well short of what is needed to put the world on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050. And the rate of improvements has been sliding since 2015, falling to its slowest in a decade in 2020. ""There is no plausible pathway to net zero emissions without using our energy resources much more efficiently,"" said Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, on publication of the report. The slow pace of investment has left facilitators from electrical and capital goods companies to software providers and investment funds exasperated that many businesses have still not taken readily available opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint. Jonathan Parr a fund manager at Triple Point Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Company, which invests in projects such as recovering waste heat from industrial sites and retrofitting insulation or heat pumps in homes says government incentives initially made renewable power projects attractive, but they have been winding down. ""The very low-hanging fruit has now disappeared,"" he says. ""The balance has shifted somewhat."" He adds that ""decarbonisation still carries a stigma that it's more expensive than other polluting alternatives"". Frustration has been compounded by the fact that the incentive to cut energy use should now be even higher as power bills have surged due to soaring gas prices. Katie McGinty, vice-president and chief sustainability and external relations officer at Johnson Controls, which makes heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, compares the missed opportunity in energy efficiency to ""$20 bills littering the sidewalk and nobody [picking] them up"". She says big barriers to adoption have included a misalignment of interests often, builders and owners do not want to upgrade buildings even if the tenants do and the US federal government not taking the same lead on building standards as it does for appliances or cars. Olivier Blum, chief strategy and sustainability officer at Schneider Electric, a French electrical equipment and software group, says that the customer's return on investment for energy efficiency projects is typically three years, but ""the corporate world was slow to start"". However, he noticed signs of change around 2018 as the ambitions of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 seeped through to boardrooms in the form of net zero commitments, which are now being converted into action. ""We see it coming,"" he says. ""It's coming from investors and boards.""    Parr says it is not just the pledges from private companies that are now driving momentum behind energy efficiency projects. ""Housing associations and local authorities have been given clear instructions that they must decarbonise their housing stock,"" he notes. Executives at groups involved in energy efficiency are also becoming more bullish that investment will flood into the sector. A need to triple annual investment in the sector worldwide by 2030 to hit net zero targets, plus companies' need to demonstrate their progress, have driven this gear shift, the executives say. ""We have realised that buildings represent 40 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and there's no decarbonising the planet without decarbonising buildings,"" explains McGinty. ""It has brought energy efficiency into the pantheon of tools next to solar, wind and electric vehicles."" That realisation has contributed to a rally in the shares prices of efficiencyenabling companies, helped by a rebound in manufacturing output after the initial impact of the Covid pandemic. Shares in Schneider Electric and Johnson Controls have almost doubled in price over two years and hit record highs in recent weeks. Britain's Spirax Sarco Engineering, which makes steam management systems an industrial staple that accounts for a ninth of US energy use, according to the country's Department of Energy has also enjoyed a share price boost. Scott Cagehin, an analyst at Investec, says investors are now on the hunt for less obvious industrial winners from the drive towards energy efficiency. ""The likes of Schneider, Vestas and Spirax have run their course in terms of being well known as ESG friendly,"" he says. ""Who shall we look at who is not [yet] acknowledged for that?"" His advice is: ""You've got to sift through those putting ESG [environmental, social and governance criteria] slides in their pack just to improve their own credentials and then look at who is winning business and growing revenues because customers are wanting to buy their products to improve their own sustainability."" However, Blum of Schneider Electric warns of a moment of reckoning as many industrial companies try to jump on the energy efficiency bandwagon. ""Many companies have seen a re-rating because of sustainability, but there will be a re-rating up and down of people that have talked about it and those who deliver it,"" he says."
65bc55a4c9684a4c03fe,2021-12-14,Say on pay: yea or nay,"Twitter: @FTLex US chief executive pay packages continue to rise, both in absolute numbers and as a multiple of the earnings of their rank-and-file workers. Despite this, shareholders support the vast bulk of say-on-pay votes. Executive pay is remarkably resilient. For all the regulator angst, remuneration committees and public opprobrium, bosses keep earning more. Last year, pay for those running S&P 500 companies rose 7 per cent to an average $15.3m, nearly 300 times that of the median worker. Institutions that run investor funds, and thus indirectly underwrite company pay cheques, tend to focus their efforts elsewhere. Regulators have, over the years, sought to task investors with taking a tougher approach. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation, introduced at the end of the financial crisis, mandated non-binding votes on executive pay, or ""say on pay"" votes. The UK started making noises on the subject in 1999 under Stephen Byers, the then trade and industry secretary. It was the first country to bring in say-on-pay rules, as advisory votes, before making them binding. Yet fund managers remain largely unwilling to block pay rises. There are exceptions 17 so far in the US this year. In 2017, Oracle's Larry Ellison had his pay halved amid shareholder disquiet. Dissenters have stepped up to object at European companies. The biggest fund manager of all, BlackRock, is taking an increasingly tough stance. But more broadly, investors are waving through ever larger pay rises. Optimists say that this reflects closeddoor conversations with investors prior to a vote. By talking in advance, both sides have a better idea of what will or will not be acceptable. Those with a less charitable outlook claim companies are simply not interested. Legal and General Investment Management, the UK's largest asset manager, stopped direct feedback to companies on the subject, saying its responses were mostly ignored. Companies that do not receive the desired response will not necessarily make big changes. Take Activision Blizzard. The Call of Duty publisher won support for boss Bobby Kotick's $155m pay package after delaying the vote following activist pressure. More pressing questions on climate and measures taken on ESG grounds vie for investor attention. Sadly, outsize increases in rewards are likely to remain a perk of the top job.

The potential violation of the deferred prosecution agreement threatens to be the latest setback for the German lender, which has been plagued by legal and regulatory woes for years. Deutsche Bank agreed in January to pay US authorities almost $125m and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve allegations that it breached bribery and fraud laws by using a network of business development consultants to funnel kickbacks to clients. However, the DoJ is exploring whether Deutsche violated this agreement after the agency learnt about the internal complaint at the bank's asset manager, DWS Group. The complaint related to the asset manager's approach to environmental, social and governance, or ESG, standards, the people said. The potential violation was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Deutsche Bank and the DoJ declined to comment. If authorities determine the accord has been violated, repercussions range from extending the three-year deferred prosecution agreement by up to one year, to criminal prosecution, according to court filings. The justice department last month said it was preparing to launch a crackdown on wrongdoing by companies. John Carlin, an official working on the department's effort, said ""you'll see cases in the weeks to come"" involving ""some of the largest corporations"" operating in the US. Carlin at the time said one potential target for the DoJ was companies that had violated the terms of deferred prosecution agreements. The department could notify companies that were in contravention of such agreements and take action against them, he said. The DoJ's tougher stance on whitecollar crime comes after Joe Biden's administration pledged to implement a more rigorous approach to corporate malfeasance than Donald Trump's presidency, when the government was accused by some detractors of being too permissive. The German lender's legal headaches include claims that the bank sold exotic financial products to small and medium-sized companies in Spain, pushing some into financial distress.

Bracewell The firm advised Resource Environmental Solutions, which specialises in environmental mitigation, on the deconstruction of a series of dams on the Klamath River in Oregon and California that is damaging local ecology. The firm negotiated a contract with the Klamath River Renewal Corporation. As the first series of dams like this to be deconstructed in the US, there were many unknowns in the project but the contract had to be negotiated with a fixed price in order to obtain regulator assent. Various stakeholder interests had to be considered, including those of two local Native American tribes, the Yurok and Karuk, that have campaigned for the dams to be dismantled. Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft Since January 2020, fund finance lawyer Wes Mission has launched nine environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related fund facilities in the US, including the largest to date, for Bank of America.

5cf3333fa4584c985920,2021-12-09,Big Four post best performance since 2002 as advisory business prospers,"The Big Four accounting firms have recorded their strongest financial perf- ormance since the collapse of Enron, as corporate clients rushed to transform their businesses during the pandemic. KPMG is set to report annual revenues of $32.1bn tomorrow, a 10 per cent increase on 2020. In aggregate, the leading pack, which also includes Deloitte, EY and PwC, will have racked up $167.3bn in turnover for this year, a 7 per cent increase. It is the strongest collective result since the Enron scandal led to the collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2002 and reduced the Big Five to the Big Four. The results come despite continued criticism of the structure and performance of the firms, especially in audit, including scrutiny of EY's failure to identify fraud at Wirecard. Demand for professional advisers has surged as companies seek to reshape their businesses in response to the pandemic and investors tighten their focus on environmental, social and governance issues. A dealmaking boom propelled growth at KPMG's advisory arm, its largest division, with sales rising 17 per cent to $13.7bn as clients spent heavily on advice for mergers and acquisitions, new technology and cyber security. The growth of ESG consulting and demand for assurance over companies' disclosures of their impact on the client represent a significant growth opportunity for the industry. The Big Four are positioning themselves as advisers to companies on how to win trust from stakeholders despite their own involvement in scandals around the world. KPMG has committed $1.5bn over three years to investment in ESG, including the development of expertise that it can sell to corporate clients, though it has not provided a detailed breakdown of how the money will be spent. The Big Four's dominance of the heavily regulated audit market gives them a ""unique and special licence"" to win work in assuring companies' ESG disclosures, said Jim Peterson, author of a book on the firms. But he said that they would face tougher competition for supremacy in the ESG consulting market, where they are ""arm-wrestling with everyone else who thinks they can capitalise"" on demand for advice. In line with its Big Four rivals, KPMG reported the sharpest increase in revenues in its Asia-Pacific operations, the smallest of its three regions. Sales there rose 13 per cent to nearly $6bn."
b873cc3f729bf9d0e249,2021-12-08,Elliott's campaign against SSE has time on its side,"Activists are meant to shake things up. But when Elliott Management took its campaign against SSE public yesterday, the energy group's share price barely stirred. Is the hedge fund losing its power to agitate? Elliott's two latest UK campaigns have been marked by an apparently conciliatory tone. There have been some sharp edges: calling for a process to decide if the chief executive is the best person for her job, as Elliott did at GlaxoSmithKline, is not exactly kind. Choosing SSE boss Alistair Phillips-Davies' tenure as the period over which to measure underperformance is perhaps a little personal. But at GSK, Elliott has backed the board's central strategy to split the consumer and pharmaceutical divisions. Its main request is for a bit more, a bit faster, please. At SSE, it does not support the board's decision last month to keep a regulated electricity networks business in the same corporate structure as a renewables champion. But it is not seeking to force a full separation on the group ? a move it said would unlock another £5bn in value. Nor is it seeking to depose Phillips-Davies. Instead, it is asking for two new independent directors with renewables experience on the board. Innocuous enough. Renewables is one of the company's two core business areas. While SSE can point to directors' experience in infrastructure and energy, it cannot argue convincingly to have renewables heavyweights able to challenge management. Hard for the chair to resist the challenge from Elliott. Easy, though, for other investors to support the activist's appeal. Even those who will not engage in a fight over financial structure can get involved with a governance debate. Frame the argument as one over a corporate split and passive investors may be agnostic: they will own SSE as a component of the FTSE 100 whether it stays as one company or divides into two. But categorise it as a question of good governance and many more shareholders ? or their ESG departments at least ? will listen to what Elliott has to say. But if Elliott's ambitions at SSE start with governance, it is plain that they do not end there. And by asking for something inoffensive to many investors, Elliott may start something that it is difficult for SSE's board to stop. The problem for SSE's management and their strategy is not the new directors in themselves. The issue is that Elliott wants them to sit with other non-executives on a ""strategic review committee"" to ""reassure investors that SSE's strategy will not be limited to the underwhelming initiatives"" the company announced last month. It is clear that Elliott hopes the new directors may tip the balance towards a break-up. Expect SSE to resist for that reason. What may move the needle, though, is time. Phillips-Davies has been chief executive for eight years already and on the board for 19. Finance director Gregor Alexander has a similarly lengthy tenure. Soon, surely, it will become time for them to move on. And soon, probably, it will become time for the company to break up anyway. The strategy it unveiled last month extends only to 2026. A full separation becomes increasingly likely as that date approaches. Elliott, by its mere pres- ence, has a decent chance of accelerating that process.    Elliott could have been far more aggressive. Its reputation is fearsome. In Europe its results, though, are not always achieved through brute force. When Elliott went into Whitbread in 2018, it was not particularly pugnacious. Yet within four months of Elliott disclosing its investment, Whitbread secured the sale of Costa to Coca-Cola at a price that would have been worth fighting for. Campaigns at GSK and SSE are likely to take longer to come good. And if they do, it may not be because of Elliott's efforts. It is uncontroversial that both currently suffer from a conglomerate discount. GSK's should dissipate at least somewhat when it divides itself next year. SSE will find it hard to resist some kind of separation indefinitely. In any case, Elliott will happily ride the upward wave. cat.rutterpooley@ft.com The hedge fund is asking for two new independent directors with renewables experience on the board"
4d4b3b16db852e1209bf,2021-12-06,Cheering Shell's Cambo exit may be premature,"MONDAY 6 DECEMBER 2021 It is better that listed, not private, companies hold brown assets Environmentalists protesting against development of the Cambo oilfield north-west of the Shetland Isles may cheer Shell's decision last week to pull out of the controversial project. To some extent, the pressure that campaigners brought to bear on the company and on the UK government, which is yet to greenlight the project, has worked. While Shell explained that it had concluded the economics of the project no longer made sense, it is likely that an increasingly hostile atmosphere, particularly in the run-up to Glasgow's hosting of the COP26 climate summit, played a part in the oil company's decision-making. But campaigners should not be too hasty: this may be a case of better the devil you know. It is preferable for publicly listed companies, accountable to their shareholders and regulators, and beholden to disclosure requirements, to hold brown assets than for them to fall into the hands of private capital, which does not have such obligations. While Cambo's depth and location makes it a particularly challenging and expensive site, Shell's departure by no means kills off the project, particularly while the government caught between its pledge for the UK to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 on the one hand, and energy security and jobs on the other equivocates on whether to approve it. Shell only ever held a 30 per cent stake in Cambo, which is majority owned and operated by Siccar Point, which is backed by private equity. This reflects an unfortunate reality that there are many willing privatecapital investors in fossil fuels. Oil majors under pressure to divest brown assets present a buying opportunity at knockdown prices, particularly if oil and gas prices continue to ricochet. Governments' failure to curb oil and gas consumption means there are still years where healthy returns can be made. There were 21 private equity deals in the oil and gas sector in the first eight months of the year alone, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. But this merely continues a trend witnessed over the past decade, where private equity has invested $1.1tn into the energy sector since 2010; only 12 per cent of that investment went into renewable energy projects, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. This means there is an onus on the institutional investors particularly public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds that espouse ESG values that private capital relies on to effect change in lieu of shareholders. Public pension funds in the US alone allocate around 9 per cent of their investments to private equity. Private pension funds' investment in private equity, infrastructure and other alternative assets is expected to increase this year as they try to offset the effects of historically low bond yields coupled with elevated valuations across equities markets. That kind of investment ought to have some serious strings attached. There is an economic case for pushing private investors to find returns in cleaner energy, particularly when new long-cycle oil and gas projects' cost of capital stands at 20 per cent, compared to 5 per cent for renewables. Brown assets ought not to be private capital's dirty secret: some transparency can be brought to bear, particularly on the larger private equity firms that are publicly listed. Markets regulators on both sides of the Atlantic need to be tougher on firms' disclosure of their fossil-fuel holdings. The Cambo case shows the path to carbon neutrality is far from smooth. And not every victory claimed by activists necessarily constitutes progress towards that goal."
522b60626421c1285b6b,2021-12-06,Lloyds targets wealthy and rental property in fresh push for growth,"? Sharp strategy reversal ? Retail revenues squeezed by rates ? £4bn war chest for expansion The chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group is preparing a strategy that will expand its ambitions in property, wealth, and commercial and investment banking as he looks to shift the lender into growth mode after years of retrenchment. Since taking over in August, Charlie Nunn has been plotting his inaugural strategic update, scheduled for February. The former HSBC executive, who succeeded António Horta-Osório after he moved to chair Credit Suisse, has a £4bn war chest after the UK's economic rebound freed up more capital. Nunn is considering quadrupling the budget of Citra Living, Lloyds' new private home rental market unit, raising it to £1bn from £250m, people familiar with the deliberations said. The number has not been finalised and could yet increase further. Expanding Citra is one of a number of measures under consideration to diversify Lloyds away from traditional retail banking, which is being squeezed by low interest rates and fintech competition. Lloyds has dominant market shares in UK mortgages and credit cards, limiting its opportunities to grow organically or make acquisitions. It also has a 19 per cent share of British SME lending, according to its latest annual report. Nunn plans to shift focus to building out the commercial bank specifically larger corporate and institutional clients as well as currency trading, insurance and wealth management, areas where Lloyds trails UK rivals. Nunn wants to ""drive growth, responsibly expand risk appetite and geographic borders"", a person familiar with the plans said, adding that the strategy had not yet been finalised. ""He doesn't just see Lloyds as a UK bank. It has a lot of international clients and it needs to do more to support them abroad."" The new growth plan would mark a sharp reversal in Lloyds' strategy after the bank was forced to scale back its presence drastically in commercial and investment banking after its 2008 government bailout. The Financial Times previously reported that the bank had set a ""strategic challenge"" of owning 10,000 residential rental properties by the end of 2025, with a further aim to reach 50,000 by 2030, making it one of the UK's largest landlords. The planned quadrupling in funding marks a far stronger commitment to expanding the business. Another plank of the new strategy will be to build out the UK wealth management business, focusing on digital services for the mass affluent segment, customers such as doctors and lawyers with up to £1m to invest, rather than the ultra-rich, the people familiar with the plans said. An existing joint venture with Schroders has posted disappointing growth since it was set up in 2018. Financing the net zero transition will be another area of interest. Lloyds has hired a 23-strong ESG investment banking team that includes recruits from industry, such as from miner Rio Tinto. Lloyds declined to comment."
d241d1f384a76698eda5,2021-12-06,Business schools must take change to heart,"Programmes lag business demand on ESG and should put purposeful profit at their core, says Colin Mayer Business is undergoing profound change. Urged on by regulatory reforms proposed by the European Commission, the continent's executives are at the forefront of promoting purposeful, responsible and sustainable business. European business schools should be at the vanguard but risk being left behind. Many schools have been slow to recognise the extent of reform required to their curricula. They have introduced electives on topics such as environmental, social and corporate governance and sustainable business but, for the most part, their core courses remain unchanged. The recent final report from the British Academy Future of the Corporation programme highlights the extent to which business is embracing purposeful profit making money by solving rather than exacerbating problems for people and planet. It argues that businesses should be supported and held to account, and sets out policies and practices. Business school research and teaching should be the source of education for the coming generation of managers and entrepreneurs. But shareholder primacy remains at the heart of schools' programmes, which are focused on economic theories, financial models and management studies. Courses start from the presumption that the purpose of a business is to maximise shareholder wealth and everything accounting, finance, marketing, operations management, organisational behaviour and strategy follows from that. Courses should begin with asking what is the purpose of business, why it is created and why it exists. They should identify the rich variety of responses and build programmes to match. They should draw on interdisciplinary knowledge from across the humanities and sciences to provide the skills and values required for business in the 21st century. This approach is inspiring for students, enlightening for leaders and productive for researchers. It positions schools at the heart of their universities, connects their knowledge with that of other faculties, and promotes the purpose of universities to contribute to human flourishing, wellbeing and prosperity alongside education and scholarship. Such an approach aligns ownership, governance, measurement, performance, finance and investment with the corporate purpose of solving problems profitably. It shows how companies engage in business and technological innovations in conjunction with the not-for-profit, public and social enterprise sectors to solve global challenges. These are the capabilities businesses increasingly seek from new recruits. Employers need graduates who can help them contribute to addressing rather than causing environmental degradation, inequality, social exclusion and mistrust. They need people with new skills in engagement, collaboration and inclusive decision-making, who can apply them not just as cost centres but as sources of value creation for investors and society at large. There are impressive developments under way. One is the recently established Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society at Insead in France, which seeks to transform business education around sustainability, inclusion and wellbeing. It is based on the idea that business should be a source of environmental and social progress as well as profit, and that should lie at the heart of research and teaching.    Harvard Business School runs a course called Reimagining Capitalism: Business and Big Problems in its MBA and has established a programme of research on impact-weighted accounts to measure companies' benefits and burdens. Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford has for several years provided core courses on responsible business and how it can address global challenges. It has research programmes on corporate purpose and ownership, governance, measurement and performance, and it is partnering with seven leading European schools to address the climate crisis. However, none of these schools has gone far enough in placing corporate purpose at the heart of core courses. One reason is that they have capital invested in existing knowledge, practices and associated research, data and reputations. Second, they have an eye on their position in rankings that prioritise such criteria as alumni salaries, linked to profit rather than wider measures of performance (see page 4). Third, there is concern about losing competitive position by migrating to what some perceive as the ""soft end"" of business school education culture not competition. The appropriate response to sceptics is factual evidence. That should come from academic research, examining performance and competitive markets, on whether purposeful business is more commercially successful, as well as more environmentally and socially sustainable, than old-fashioned business. Companies have a vital role to play in encouraging business schools to adapt. They can prioritise the recruitment of students with the skill sets associated with purposeful business practices. They can finance research at scale on topics related to ""profits from progress"". They can endow scholarships and faculty positions to attract students and academics with the necessary attitudes and expertise. Whether schools backed by business can transform themselves will determine whether business education remains relevant and survives in the years ahead."

0e9e5b9dd3ee5cab0d65,2021-12-03,Health is wealth investors can no longer afford to ignore it.........................................................................................204,"Commodities The gold mining industry risks being ignored by large pension funds and other investors if it cannot justify the environmental impact of its activities, according to one of the sector's most influential fund managers. BlackRock's Evy Hambro told an industry conference that people could see the need to dig giant holes in the ground to mine energy-transition metals such as copper and nickel, but that the case is less clear for gold. ""I think when it comes to other commodities that don't play that role, it becomes much harder to justify why you're having to do the digging in the first place,"" Hambro said at the Mines and Money event in London. Over the past couple of years, investors have become increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics when deciding what stocks to buy and sell. Apart from jewellery, gold has few industrial uses and, while the industry is a valuable source of employment and taxes in some of the world's poorest countries, most of the gold mined today is stored in vaults. ""I think what we're now starting to see from investors when you're looking at the resources sector through the ESG lens ... is which commodities are important against how they are produced,"" said Hambro, who manages BlackRock's World Mining Trust and its World Gold Fund. He said the gold industry needed to think together with organisations such as the World Gold Council about how they portray their story, particularly given the rise of cryptocurrencies that have garnered enthusiasm among some retail investors. ""Gold has been a financial asset, a means of exchange for thousands of years,"" he said. ""And I think it will continue to be the case a long way into the future but we need to find a way of getting gold into circulation so that it actually becomes money."" Hambro did not say how this might be achieved but one option, say analysts, would be to allow investors to collect dividend payments from gold miners in bullion, through a gold-backed exchange traded fund. These funds could then be linked to payment applications that offer customers the ability to spend gold like a currency. The NYSE Arca Gold Bugs index, tracking big US miners, has shed around 14 per cent this year as the spectre of higher interest rates has dented the price of the precious metal. Gold prices are down 6 per cent over the period. Hambro, who was speaking after US central bank chief Jay Powell conceded the risk of a prolonged period of higher inflation had risen, said gold would be a ""natural place"" for investors to turn to as a hedge against higher price growth."
0be243234b42d7a4faf7,2021-12-02,Investor groups fail to honour Brazil rainforest pledges,"Asset management. Divestment threats Lack of action prompts fears over industry's commitment to environmental targets Several European investment groups that last year threatened to divest from Brazil over soaring deforestation have not done so, even as new figures show the pace of destruction of the Amazon rainforest is at its worst since 2006. European food retailers, including Britain's Tesco and Marks and Spencer have also shied away from threats to boycott Brazilian produce, saying that they now favour a united approach by industry and government to stop the felling of the world's largest rainforest. The lack of action has prompted concerns about the commitment of asset managers and retailers to take effective action if environmental targets are not met. It has also led to worries that the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro who has long advocated opening the rainforest to commercial development could feel emboldened if it believes boycotts will not happen. ""The latest data highlights that true change has unfortunately not yet occurred [in the Brazilian Amazon],"" said Thede Rüst, head of emerging markets debt at Nordea Asset Management, just one of two investment groups out of seven to follow through on their threats of divestment. ""This increasingly concerns us as we do not want to be accused of 'engagement washing' meaning having some dialogue to look good, yet not achieving real progress,"" he added. ""If nothing happens, [then] this may potentially harm future engagements as countries learn that they can deflect criticism by engaging without taking actions,"" said Rüst, noting that Nordea had in August last year divested shares of Brazilian meatpacker JBS worth $40m over its environmental record. In June 2020, more than two dozen financial institutions around the world wrote to the Brazilian government, demanding it rein in surging deforestation which they said has created ""widespread uncertainty about the conditions for investing in or providing financial services to Brazil"". Seven of the companies including Norway's largest pension fund KLP and the UK's Legal & General Investment Management explicitly threatened to divest from meatpackers and grain traders linked to deforestation as well as Brazilian sovereign bonds, if the situation did not improve. Jeanett Bergan, then head of responsible investment at KLP, told Reuters at the time that divestments could happen ""as soon as this year [2020]"". Since then, deforestation has continued to soar. More than 13,200 sq km of rainforest was razed in the 12 months between August last year and July a 22 per cent jump from the previous year and the highest rate of deforestation in 15 years according to data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research.    The forest is typically razed to make way for cattle ranching, soyabean farming or gold mining much of which seeps through poorly regulated supply chains into international markets. Of the seven groups, only Nordea and Dutch group Robeco made divestments in the past year with the majority of the companies now saying they favour ""engagement"" particularly after the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow, where Brazil won plaudits for pledging to eradicate illegal deforestation by 2028. ""Exclusions and active ownership are two equally important tools that we as an investor have at our disposal,"" said Sara Skärvad of Storebrand, which co-chairs the Investor Policy Dialogue on Deforestation (IPDD), an investor pressure group. ""Divestment can be the solution but isn't always. Sometimes engagement takes us further."" Graham Stock, partner at BlueBay Asset Management who has been talking to the Brazilian government as the other co-chair of the IPDD said: ""I don't think we should give up on the engagement yet,"" adding that new data showing a decrease in Amazon fires in the past three months suggested a ""slightly better picture"" was emerging. ""[Our clients] want to hear about engagement,"" he said. ""They are not narrowing their interests in Brazil to this single issue. There are other elements in the ESG [environmental, social and governance] story. Disinvestment would be a blunt instrument and an overreaction."" Norway's KLP, Storebrand and UK asset manager LGIM told the Financial Times that they had not divested from Brazil over environmental concerns in the past year. Swedish state pension fund Ap7 said it had not divested but added that it had ""blacklisted JBS a couple of years ago"" due to concerns over labour practices. Oslo-based DNB Asset Management said it had ""previously excluded"" companies based on deforestation risk, and Brazilian companies with links to illegal deforestation were not a part of its actively managed mandates. It said it was in ""ongoing dialogue"" with agribusiness group Bunge, which is included in index funds the group manages. All of the investment groups that spoke with the Financial Times said they would still consider divesting if Brazil did not take further action. JBS and Bunge did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The issue has become more pressing in recent weeks following a proposed draft law from Brussels that would ban imports into the EU of agricultural products, including beef and soyabeans, which come from deforested land. If the proposal is made law, it could sharply impact Brazil's big meatpackers, such as JBS and Marfrig, but also international grain traders, such as Cargill, which maintain operations or source produce in the Brazilian Amazon and the Cerrado savannah region. ""[The EU proposal] alone sends a strong signal to the market of what is expected,"" said Jan Erik Saugestad, chief executive of Storebrand, adding that his company could still divest ""if results fail to happen"". Several food retailers have backed away from earlier threats of a boycott. Last year, more than 40 European companies, including Tesco and M&S, warned they could boycott Brazilian produce if a land reform bill widely expected to spur Amazonian deforestation passed Congress. Although the bill did not progress, deforestation has nonetheless continued to increase. Many of the companies now say there needs to be a unified push by governments and business to address the issue. ""We're committed to playing our part in tackling deforestation but we need the whole food industry and governments to join us,"" said a spokesperson for Tesco in comments echoed by Co-op, Sainsbury's and the British Retail Consortium, which also represents M&S. 'This increasingly concerns us as we do not want to be accused of engagement washing'"
ff980feb01fc3705af72,2021-12-01,Glencore/Bluebell: underpowered flower,"Twitter: @FTLex It is fitting that an activist named after a flower is campaigning against the production of environment-trashing coal. Bluebell Capital wants Londonlisted Glencore to clean up its act. First on a list of potential disposals are some very profitable thermal coal mines. Bluebell's hostility to fossil fuel makes sense from an environmental perspective. But disposals by the Swiss miner and commodity trader would hurt shareholders in the short term. China and India resisted pressure for a speedy rundown of coal power at the recent COP26 summit. Glencore has at least set a timeframe, albeit a leisurely 30 years. Bluebell argues the strategy is morally and financially flawed. Only the former proposition might apply. Glencore's share price has soared 75 per cent in the past 12 months, far outrunning UK-listed mining peers. Copper has made a big difference, but so has the high price of coal. Ebitda from that source should total $5.7bn this financial year, according to Visible Alpha, more than a quarter of the group's total this year. That more than doubles the 2020 percentage. Bluebell thinks Glencore should sell the assets and give shareholders the cash. Long-run prices for premium coal suggest the mines could be worth as much as $12bn, according to Liberum analysts. That would exceed shareholder payouts, dividends and buybacks, for 2018 and 2019 together. The activist thinks Glencore could raise capital by selling marginal assets such as Viterra, an agricultural commodities trader. Bluebell sees Viterra as under-appreciated, given that Glencore's 49 per cent stake means its numbers are deconsolidated. The holding's book value of $3.7bn is well below the $6.5bn Bluebell values it at, on 4 times trailing ebitda. The flaw in the argument for disposals is that Glencore's trading business benefits from having a wide range of commodities to deal in. Bluebell is on firmer ground in criticising corporate governance. New chair Kalidas Madhavpeddi has lots to do amid investigations into alleged corruption. Shareholders would mostly agree that Glencore should pay more attention to the ""G"" in ""Environmental, Social and Governance"". It is one reason the total shareholder return since the 2011 IPO is just 10 per cent. However, many investors are happy for the group to drag its feet on the ""E"" in ""ESG"". Bluebell is unlikely to win a wealth of support by raising the contradiction."
5fea959541b87a73383e,2021-12-01,Companies need to take a new approach to sustainability data,"Letters Sustainability is shaping global markets in the 21st century; $100tn of assets under management today are committed to the UN's Principles for Responsible Investment. However, as Martin Wolf recently noted, ""there is still a frighteningly long way to go"", and the potential for private investment to drive this change remains unfulfilled (""Dancing on the edge of climate disaster"", Opinion, November 24). Inconsistency around environmental, social and governance data remains a significant practical challenge. Lack of disclosure and limited accessibility are limiting investment in low-carbon and sustainable business activities. Urgent action is needed to rectify this. Too many companies are failing to disclose useful sustainability data. Only 1 per cent of businesses, for example, are making substantial disclosures of their climate risks. For many, lack of alignment is not deliberate; disclosure against hundreds of different reporting conventions is simply too challenging as things stand. That is why we, a global alliance of financial institutions, investors and businesses, are launching a new central source for accessible, digital, corporate sustainability information in support of the 10 principles of the UN's Global Compact. ESG Book will allow corporates autonomy over the disclosure and maintenance of sustainability data in real time, unrestricted by the annual reporting cycle. Reported ESG data will in turn be made available to all stakeholders for free, displayed in an impartial manner and independent of current opaque ratings. Our aim is a new, co-ordinated approach to ESG data, where corporate sustainability information is widely available, comparable and transparent. By changing how this data is integrated and measured on a global scale, we will directly connect companies to their stakeholders in an unprecedented way.

3f5cd79ed3de70d4b2b0,2021-12-01,Defence sector faces tide of ESG resistance,"Industry parades contribution to sustainability and security amid fears it is becoming an investment no-go area The defence industry is used to being targeted by antiwar demonstrators but now faces a different kind of adversary: socially conscious investors. They are stepping up demands to cut the carbon footprint of fuel-hungry fighter jets and battle tanks and urging greater transparency in the manufacture and sale of weapons following a surge in environmental, social and governance investing. Some executives, particularly in Europe, say the growing scrutiny, a lack of precise investment definitions and new sustainable finance proposals could leave their sector the pariah of the investment world. The ASD European trade federation has written to the European Commission warning that proposals on socially sustainable finance threaten to undermine its members' ability to invest, with banks and fund managers turning increasingly away from the sector. The federation points out what it says are contradictions between the EU's desire to strengthen its capability in defence and draft proposals on criteria to define sectors that are socially positive or socially harmful. Already banks and investors are cutting ties with the industry, said Alessandro Profumo, ASD president and chief executive of Leonardo, the Italian defence group. ""It is important that initiatives on sustainable finance do not contradict other EU policies,"" he said. EU measures should ""recognise the importance of the industry ... Defence is part of sustainability and must be recognised as such. Without security we cannot have sustainability."" Other European executives say a valuation gap is opening up with the US, where defence groups are more widely accepted for their role as government contractors despite being excluded from ESG-focused funds. Some executives are fighting back. Several of Europe's largest defence companies, including France's Thales and Britain's BAE Systems, have stepped up their efforts to explain what they do and stress their contributions to economies and national security. Both groups held ESG-focused seminars last month. ""If, for whatever reason, sectors are blackballed, then it constrains where you can put money to work and ultimately loses the opportunity for good returns,"" said Sir Roger Carr, chair of BAE Systems, Britain's largest defence contractor, in response to an analyst question at a company event last month. ""We are there to help ourselves but also to help the industry to make sure this sector is not on a naughty step and is understood for the value it creates and the ethics and principles that it adopts in the way it delivers its product."" Bertrand Delcaire, head of investor relations at Thales, said: ""As the designer of many innovative solutions for a greener, safer and more inclusive world, we do not understand how cyber security, in which we are a tier-one player, can be seen as a positive ESG activity while other elements of our product portfolio such as radars, sonars and military communication systems that contribute to physical security are seen as a negative ESG activity.""    A particular worry for European executives is the absence of precisely defined ESG investment criteria. Charles Woodburn, chief executive of BAE Systems, said the industry was ""suffering from a lack of consensus in defining ESG compliance, which is causing some investment funds to exclude all defence stocks, rather than taking a more considered approach to assess individual company strategies and portfolios"". ""European defence stocks are trading at reduced multiples compared to US peers as a result of investors adopting more stringent ESG criteria,"" he said. Another concern, said some, is that the whole sector could fall foul of exclusions. ""Blanket ESG exclusions have no middle ground. It does not make sense to simply exclude from an ESG fund all companies that have more than 5 or 10 per cent of sales in defence without looking carefully at the products they actually make,"" said one executive. Robert Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said: ""ESG remains a big headwind for European defence companies, though it has yet to cross the Atlantic. The sector as a whole has been 'blacklisted' by many European investors, and even if defence companies replanted the Amazon they would still be on the blacklist."" In Europe, KLP, the Norwegian pension group, is among those tightening its approach. The fund recently announced it had sold holdings totalling $147m in companies including Raytheon of the US and Rolls-Royce and Babcock International of the UK because of what it said were their links to certain types of weapon such as nuclear armaments. The fund is taking a ""more stringent line"" in particular towards ""borderline cases"", said Kiran Aziz, KLP's head of responsible investments, stressing that the fund was ""not against defence"". ""We support that every country has to be invested in defence,"" Aziz said. ""Norway is in Nato."" Rolls-Royce said in response to KLP's divestment that its ""involvement in nuclear systems for the UK Royal Navy involves the design, manufacture and servicing of the nuclear power plant and propulsion system for its nuclear-powered submarines, not the production of any weapons"". There is nothing new about investors' qualms over defence groups. Investment in weapons such as cluster bombs and landmines as defined in international treaties is banned and is well established in the asset management industry. Many mainstream funds adhere to universal indices set by the likes of MSCI. These can range from universal indices with the ""smallest amount of exclusions such as landmines and cluster munitions"" towards those that apply higher ESG rates, said Meggin Thwing Eastman, research editorial director for MSCI ESG Research. For ESG investors, weapons manufacturers are often lumped together with tobacco and coal companies and are excluded from funds. Some, such as BlackRock's screened ESG exchange traded funds, hold no companies that make controversial weapons or civilian firearms. Vanguard's ESG global corporate bond ETF excludes debt from weapons makers. ""As ESG funds increasingly dominate asset flows, negative screening has risen ... characterised by increasingly stringent internal metrics (societal value) and administrative reporting burdens,"" said Charlotte Keyworth, analyst at Barclays, in a recent note. From about a 30 per cent premium in late 2019, EU defence now trades in line with tobacco, said Keyworth, attributing the change ""in part to the rise of ESG investor concerns in Europe"". UK defence stocks, bolstered by a spate of recent takeover activity, are trading at a premium to the wider UK market. Nuclear is a further area of concern. Executives are increasingly fielding questions about their work on countries' nuclear defence programmes. Babcock International, Britain's second-biggest contractor, included an investor frequently asked question on nuclear weapons for the first time in its annual report this year. Thales similarly used its ESG event to explain that it is one of more than 140 direct suppliers on the French nuclear missile programme but that its involvement was not specific to the nuclear nature of the missile and represented less than 0.1 per cent of total group sales.    BAE used its event to commit to its exit in the near future from white phosphorous, the chemical component used in incendiary weapons. The company said that less than 0.1 per cent of its sales still related to products containing white phosphorous and that it was in talks with the UK Ministry of Defence to phase in a replacement solution. Making the case for defence, however, is only likely to get harder. ""The risk of continued ESG headwinds doesn't just undermine the defensive characteristics of defence stocks, it potentially risks them becoming an uninvestable asset class for European fund managers,"" warned Stallard.

3fc533c7ae7e1e0fe8e8,2021-11-29,Green bonds face new questions over authenticity,"Sustainability Potential to save on interest costs leads issuers to push boundaries, says Patrick Temple-West The booming demand for investments that help finance a cleaner world has forced new questions about 'green' bonds. Companies and countries are increasingly issuing these bonds to help fund solutions to social and environmental problems. More than $800bn-worth of sustainable bonds had been issued as of September 30, according to Bank of America. And the bank has predicted that the total will reach $1tn by the end of this year. Already, in November, pharmaceutical company Teva has raised a record $5bn through a sustainabilitylinked bond. A month earlier, Japanese telecom NTT raised $2.7bn in one of the largest green bond deals of the year. But the market's growth has invited scepticism about the authenticity of sustainable debt. Companies in China, for example — despite the country's poor pollution and human rights record — are big issuers of so-called green debt. Belarus, Saudi Arabia and Russia have also sold bonds to money managers that claim to adhere to environmental, social and governance criteria. ESG principles can sometimes seem overly flexible, as well. Earlier this year, JPMorgan bought debt from CoreCivic, a private prisons operator — two years after saying it would no longer finance the private prison industry. Investors were also invited to buy a sustainability-liked bond issued by Brazilian meat company JBS, which has come under fire from campaigners over deforestation and labour standards. So, for bond funds, decisions about which social and green bonds to buy have to be considered carefully by individual managers. ""We decide, not the issuer, whether the green bond is really green,"" says Bertrand Rocher, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Mirova in Paris. Whether managers should buy green bonds from a country with a questionable human rights record has become a contentious issue. At Mirova, Rocher says: ""We try to understand whether these countries have a chance to transition toward a more democratic version of their politics. Or whether they are stuck for decades with politics that will never change."" That means a green bond from Hungary would probably be acceptable, but a green bond from China would not, he explains. Rocher notes that the Hungarian people have opportunities to overhaul the government in future elections but, in China, ""we don't feel that the Chinese power will change anytime soon."" Consequently, when it comes to China, ""even if the green bond is purely perfect, we will not accept it."" Fund managers are also looking to non-governmental organisations such as Transparency International and Freedom House to help with screening for human rights issues, says Saida Eggerstedt, head of sustainable credit at Schroders.    However, her view is that, if a country is excluded under a screening process but then issues a sustainable or green bond, ""the sustainable investor should encourage that and it could be that an exception is made to the exclusion rule."" Fund managers must be able to prove why they overrode the exclusion, though. ""Clients ask questions: 'Why did you do it?'"" she points out. Regulators, too, are starting to ask questions. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority this month published a discussion paper on the disclosures fund managers should make. At the same time, Finma, Switzerland's financial regulator, published guidance to protect fund investors from so-called 'greenwashing', or misleading claims. Companies and countries are pushing the boundaries of what might be considered a green bond because the savings on debt interest can be significant. Demand has led green bonds to be priced at a premium to conventional bonds, which gives issuers slightly lower interest-rate costs. For European green bonds, the premium has increased this year, Bank of America said in a November 1 report. But, with definitions being stretched, ESG fund managers are having to seek help in verifying how issuers use bond proceeds. At Nuveen, ESG funds ""use third-party data providers"" to identify bonds to invest in, says Stephen Liberatore, lead portfolio manager for the firm's fixed-income ESG funds. In the US, managers want better disclosure. ""We believe that increased transparency and standardisation of reporting from issuers can help investors better identify the best actors,"" says Robert Fernandez, director of ESG research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors."
d537f769f29d6291eeb5,2021-11-27,Company bosses need to show bonus restraint,"I nvestment managers want the companies in which they invest to do well and deliver sustainable returns over the years ahead. That means a key role for the managers, who oversee the savings of 75 per cent of UK households, is to engage with the company executives and boards on their strategy, and to ensure their impact on their employees, communities and the environment is positive. Investment managers want to see companies treat their employees fairly, have boards and senior leadership which reflect the diversity of their customers, and that are planning for the future. Where companies are not following this long-term approach, the manager will engage with them through the year and may even vote against the company's plans at their annual general meeting to show their concern. Crucially, shareholders have the opportunity to vote on a company pay policy. That's why every year the Investment Association sets out its principles of remuneration essentially, the best practice investors expect to see when it comes to executive pay and bonuses. This year, our principles build on our approach from the past few years, focusing on: continued restraint in light of the pandemic and how best to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics into pay structures. While Covid-19 appears to be easing, no one underestimates its continuing impact. Many companies have struggled during the pandemic, but others have seen a business bonanza because the services they offered have been in greater demand. We have been pleased to see that business leaders have shown pay restraint throughout this time. These companies have balanced the need to incentivise senior leadership, while at the same time being mindful of the experiences of their staff, customers, suppliers and wider community. We recognise that companies need to compensate their executive teams properly to attract and keep the best talent. But companies that furloughed staff should not now seek high levels of executive pay. At the start of the pandemic we called on companies to ensure that executive pay reflected the approach to pay and conditions for the wider workforce. If a company took government money, investors were clear that those same companies should not be paying bonuses to senior executives unless that money had been paid back. This is only fair. We were very pleased to see that the vast majority of FTSE All-share companies met these expectations last year and set their pay outcomes in the context of the stakeholder experience. But as many companies have relied on government funding and still had staff on furlough at the start of this financial year, ensuring this fair approach is maintained will be critical for investors in the coming year.    Climate change is the single biggest risk facing our planet, society and business today, and investment managers are committed to supporting companies to manage their impact on the planet and the effect on their business. These considerations are of increasing importance to people across the country. This year, retail savers invested on average more than £1bn a month into funds applying ESG considerations. There is no doubt that climate change affects every company, its customers, employees and shareholders. With the recent COP26 conference focusing minds on the need to take action to address climate change, we have seen more companies link executive pay and bonuses to ESG metrics. How a company is run will determine its long-term value, and shareholders need to know that company boards are planning now for the transition to a net zero future. That's why this year shareholders are asking that where ESG factors are part of a company's strategy, these are similarly included in their remuneration and, where they aren't, the board should explain to investors how they will do this in future years. These expectations and all our principles fall equally on investment managers themselves. They take their impact on the planet very seriously and are rightly incorporating ESG risks into their strategies and their remuneration. Investors have a responsibility to engage with the companies they invest in, to understand their strategy in order to support them to prosper, but also to hold them to account when need be. By ensuring that company executive pay is fair, and linked to the future sustainability of the business, investment managers are helping the companies they invest in to thrive in future years. This benefits the savers of today who will become the pensioners of tomorrow and will reap the dividends of this prudent, long-term investment approach.

d859ed4ecb96e42e6c72,2021-11-22,BBVA intensifies Turkey commitment but few dare to follow suit,"Banks. Foreign investment Spanish lender to take full ownership of Garanti despite steep rise in political risks As Carlos Torres Vila, head of BBVA, set out why the Spanish lender planned to take full ownership of Turkish bank Garanti, it did not always sound like the sales pitch typically rolled out for corporate deals. But the 55-year-old BBVA chair could hardly ignore the backdrop to the deal, years of erratic economic management and turbulent politics under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""We have seen recurrent crises, spiralling inflation and depreciation of the currency, and we have suffered that in our flesh and blood, through devaluation of our invested amount,"" Torres said last week, as BBVA announced plans to pay €2.25bn for the remaining 50 per cent of Garanti, which it has been building a stake in since 2011. The bid, which would be one of Turkey's biggest single foreign direct investments in recent years if shareholders and regulators approve it, buoyed the country's stock market. But BBVA shares closed the day down 4 per cent, with analysts at Citigroup describing the deal as ""risky"". Despite the euphoria in Istanbul, business executives and analysts warned it was too early to declare whether the move would herald more investment in a country whose strategic location and 83m-strong population has long held great promise for foreign companies. ""Most western investors see the political risk in Turkey as too high right now,"" said Jonathan Friedman, an analyst at Wallbrook, a global risk and ESG consultancy. Instead, the BBVA deal fits into a pattern familiar to foreign diplomats in Turkey: while new entrants remain deeply wary, some of those companies with a longstanding presence are prepared to increase their commitment. Torres hailed the chance to capture the rest of Garanti as a great deal, in part because of the Spanish bank's intimate knowledge of the Turkish lender, which was already largely consolidated in BBVA's accounts. Over the past five years Garanti had generated an average of €1.2bn-€1.3bn in net profits a year, he added, even though the Turkish lira has tumbled more than 70 per cent against the euro since the start of 2016. The currency sank further on Thursday after the central bank slashed interest rates, defying warnings that the move would further fuel inflation. The decline in the lira was steep enough to drag on BBVA shares. Ahmet Burak Daglioglu, head of the Turkish government's investment office, which is tasked with attracting foreign capital, insisted that ""the risk perception of those outside Turkey is higher than those inside Turkey"". It is a view echoed by Cavit Habib, the chief executive of the Turkish division of Danish services provider ISS, which has been in the country for 16 years and this year acquired a local facilities management company. ""Being here and looking at things from the outside are totally two different things,"" said Habib. Nor is BBVA the only foreign company willing to stomach the macro turmoil. Ford Otosan, a partnership between the US carmaker and Turkey's largest conglomerate that dates back almost a century, announced in March plans to invest €2bn over the next five years. Huhtamaki, a Finnish producer of sustainable packaging that first entered Turkey in 1997, acquired local company Elif Plastik for €412m in September.    ""It's not a new market for us. That makes it easier,"" said Katariina Hietaranta, a Huhtamaki official, adding that the fact the majority of its sales were exports ""helps a lot to mitigate the currency risk"". However, international companies already in Turkey are not blind to the dangers, including a steady erosion of democratic freedoms and the rule of law. Erdogan's determination to prioritise growth at all costs, and relentless interference in the central bank, has hammered the lira while leaving Turkey mired in a boom-and-bust cycle. Although the IMF forecasts the economy will grow about 9 per cent this year, that expansion has come with an inflation rate running at 20 per cent. The corporate departures from Turkey in recent years have been notable, including Japanese carmaker Honda and US home appliance maker Whirlpool. UniCredit, Italy's second-largest bank, joined them this month, with plans to sell its final 20 per cent stake in Turkish lender Yapi Kredi in 2022. Andrea Orcel has set about simplifying UniCredit's global footprint since joining as chief executive. The disposal of its stake in Yapi Kredi was part of that strategy. But a person with knowledge of the bank's plans said the relative lack of liquidity in Turkey's capital markets, combined with political uncertainty in Ankara, played a part in the decision. Turkish officials say foreign direct investment figures for this year will improve on the levels seen in 2019 and 2020, when they languished at 15-year lows, with the country's growing technology sector helping. Turkey bulls also point to the growing confidence among opposition parties that Erdogan could be forced from power in elections that are due in 2023, but could take place sooner. ""The consensus view is that all Turkey needs is for one man to retire and the country could be off to the races,"" said Charles Robertson of Renaissance Capital, the investment bank. Yet analysts such as Friedman said betting that the worst was over was a huge gamble. He added: ""Investing on the upswing is always seen as lower risk than trying to time the bottom.""

4161f7638cd858ef6fff,2021-11-22,US commission heralds coming capital wars,"I f there's one thing both Republicans and Democrats can agree on, it's that China is America's biggest longterm strategic threat. And yet US financial firms couldn't be more bullish on the Middle Kingdom. Banks like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are expanding their business there, as are asset managers like BlackRock. But what will happen when Wall Street's aspirations for riches in China meet the political realities of Main Street America? It's a question that has been put front and centre by the annual US-China Economic and Security Review Commission report, issued to Congress last week, which recommended a host of new limits on business between the two countries, not just on goods and labour, but also capital flows. The commission, whose members are appointed by both minority and majority leaders in Congress, has a good record for predicting legislative and regulatory trends. It was the first to raise Huawei as an issue (in 2004), highlighted risks within crucial supply chains in areas such as pharmaceuticals as early as 2010, and put the issue of forced labour in Xinjiang on the political map. As the most recent report put it, not only is the Chinese Communist party using economic coercion and increasing state control to advance its own political model, ""Chinese policymakers are courting foreign capital and fund managers as they work to make China's capital markets serve as a vehicle to fund the CCP's technology development objectives and other policy goals."" The 32 new recommendations for combating this include: limiting investments in variable interest entities (VIEs) linked to Chinese entities; empowering the Securities and Exchange Commission to require companies to disclose whether they are sourcing from or invested in companies that utilise forced labour in Xinjiang or are on the US Department of Commerce's Entity List or Treasury's Military-Industrial Complex Companies; and mandating that public US companies report whether there is a Chinese Communist party committee anywhere in their operations. There are also suggestions on limiting the use of cloud computing and data servicing operations owned by Chinese firms. The potential market implications should such rules become law are myriad. Consider just the idea of forcing ""publicly traded US companies with facilities in China"" to report on an annual basis ""whether there is a Chinese Communist party committee in their operations and summarise the actions and corporate decisions in which such committees may have participated."" This may seem an extreme move, but the overlap between non-state firms and the Communist party in China has grown tremendously in recent years. Citing figures used by the CCP's own Organisation Department (and also cited by western scholars), the report notes that ""in 1998, a mere 0.9 per cent of non-state firms had CCP committees, a figure that rose to 16 per cent by 2008. By 2013, committee presence in nonstate firms expanded to 58 per cent, and by 2017 it reached 73 per cent, accounting for 1.9 million firms."" Assuming these figures are accurate, it's hard to imagine a western company or financial institution doing business in China that wouldn't have a potential problem. It's also hard to imagine that western financial institutions purporting to prioritise ESG concerns won't come under increasing pressure to justify the hypocrisies of working with an autocratic government. On the flip side, the commission is also recommending protections for US investors in Chinese assets. In particular, the report flags VIEs, which are used by Chinese companies to get around rules prohibiting them from having foreign investors. Such vehicles include the largest percentage of Chinese issues by value sold on US exchanges. But they are opaque;    regulators like the SEC have raised concerns about the risks they pose for investors, who often don't get the same amount of information as for typical listed firms, and don't have any governing control in any case. Should it come to pass, the combination of regulating VIEs, index providers that have had a huge impact on the flow of funds into China, and approaching US-China capital flows as an ESG issue could be market moving. Indeed, I'd bet that capital will become the next front in US-China economic decoupling. Some will argue that this will increase geopolitical friction and harm the global economy. That may be true. But while Wall Street understandably wants to exploit the largest pool of new international investors, and Beijing needs capital to paper over its own homegrown debt problems, it's hard not to see the rush of financial firms into China as reflecting a continued wilful blindness about the ""one world, two systems"" paradigm. It's worth noting that the US China Economic and Security Review Commission itself was formed by Congress in 2000 as a way to monitor the evolution of relations between the two nations, even as China was en route to becoming a member of the World Trade Organization. There were high hopes but also doubts, even back then that China would get freer as it got richer. The doubts have, of course, proved well founded. Anyone who thinks that there won't be more constraints on business between the two countries would be wise to read the report carefully. rana.foroohar@ft.com A report issued to Congress has recommended a host of new limits on business with China"
d27f1c0af58f1f2af833,2021-11-22,LGIM to stop feedback on executive pay after advice often ignored,"Financials Legal and General Investment Management, the UK's largest asset manager, will stop almost all direct feedback to companies on their executive pay, after finding its responses were ignored most of the time. The £1.3tn asset manager outlined the change in approach in its annual letter to the chairs of remuneration committees, which it is sending to all of the 600 or so companies in the FTSE All-Share index. ""Most companies don't act on the remuneration feedback we give them,"" Angeli Benham, senior global ESG manager at LGIM, said in an interview. ""For example, they write to us saying they're going to increase the chief executive's bonus from 150 per cent of salary to 200 per cent of salary. Our feedback is to say LGIM cannot support that, but they do it anyway."" She added: ""Often we're an outlier among shareholders with our stricter stance on bonus increases, because we do not support them. Companies tend to do what's right for management rather than listening to us a shareholder."" For the past decade, LGIM has responded to companies that consult with the asset manager about proposed changes to executive pay. But it found that for about 80 per cent of the proposed changes, ""the answers are already covered in our policy document, which is detailed and directive"", said Benham. From now on, LGIM will direct remuneration consultations to its policy document, and only respond to those that are deemed exceptional, such as relating to the application of discretion or where the policy is unusual or not covered in the policy document. ""While we still think that it's important to give companies feedback on changes to their executive pay ... our time is better spent on educating the market on areas like income inequality and climate change,"" said Benham. LGIM voted against 37.5 per cent of new pay policies in the UK in 2020 and earlier this year said it would take an even tougher line on pay in 2021, in the wake of the pandemic. In particular, it was looking to make sure that companies that had taken furlough money or cut dividends did not pay bonuses. Earlier this year, it voted against pay and bonus schemes at Cineworld, Hollywood Bowl and Future, the magazine publisher. The asset manager's 2021 votes on pay have not yet been published. The letter to remuneration committee chairs also encouraged companies to offer free shares to all employees, to motivate them and allow them to share in the success of their employer. Schroders, the £717bn asset manager, has launched an initiative to give all of its about 5,500 employees 5 per cent of their salary in shares. Meanwhile, LGIM is asking all companies to pay their employees the real living wage, which is £9.50 an hour nationally and £10.75 in London. ""We want them to focus more on their employees than on their executives,"" said Karoline Herms, senior global ESG manager at LGIM.    'Our time is better spent on educating the market on areas like income disparity and climate change'"
7dab734ea5b5b0759524,2021-11-20,Bidders for Unilever's tea unit withdrew over plantation fears,"? Rivals had ESG jitters ? Focus on Kenya sites ? Buyer CVC made sole offer Two of three final bidders for Unilever's tea business balked at taking on its plantations because of concerns about working conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. The tea unit, which includes the PG Tips and Lipton brands, was sold this week to CVC Capital Partners for €4.5bn. The Luxembourg-based buyout group was left as the only bidder willing to buy the whole division after Carlyle and Advent International decided they could not take on tea plantations in east Africa, which face difficult questions over human rights and fair pay. Their decision underscored heightened sensitivity of investors towards assets that have substantial environmental, social or governance risks. Advent excluded the tea estates from its final offer, two people with knowledge of the issue said. Carlyle dropped out before this week's bid deadline. Advent had grown concerned about accepting responsibility for the health, welfare and security of thousands of plantation workers, one person said. Bosses on the plantations have power not only over workers' jobs but also their housing and medical care, as the sites are often in remote areas and rely on workers brought in from elsewhere. The buyout group was worried that violence could flare on its Kericho plantation in Kenya after the general election set for August next year. Seven people were killed, 56 women raped and many injured in an assault on the plantation after disputed elections in 2007, according to a complaint filed by 218 Kenyans to two UN bodies last year. A report on the plantations, produced for Advent, ""didn't make for pretty reading"", said one of the people familiar with the situation. That led the buyout group to exclude the plantations from its offer, bidding instead for the brands. Unilever's Kenyan business is reviewing claims that it failed adequately to help workers affected by an attack on its Kericho plantation amid ethnic violence in 2007. It has more recently come into conflict with Kenyan workers as it automates picking, leading to job cuts. The plantation has also been the scene of sexual harassment of women workers by some managers. Unilever has responded with measures including more female leaders, training and an ethics hotline. Pay in the tea industry is low. PG Tips says it pays workers at Kericho approximately two and a half times the statutory minimum agricultural income in Kenya, which was raised to the equivalent of just over £53 a month in 2018.    Francis Atwoli, secretary-general of the Central Organisation of Trade Unions of Kenya, said that there remained outstanding claims for compensation from workers, which could mean ""the potential buyer would have a lot of problems"". Around 8,500 people are permanently employed on the Unilever plantations in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda, and this rises to about 16,000 when temporary workers are added in the peak season, Unilever said. Carlyle dropped out because of con- cerns about ""ESG considerations"", one person familiar with its thinking said, relating to concerns about plantation conditions. Blackstone decided early on not to bid for the tea division, in part because of concerns about the treatment of workers, another person added. They described it as ""a massive ESG issue"". CVC declined to comment. It decided that Unilever had been a good steward of the business, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Its dealmakers also took comfort from Unilever's reputation for being proactive on ESG issues and from the business's membership of the Ethical Tea Partnership, which aims to make the tea industry fairer and more environmentally sustainable, the person said. Unilever said that it had programmes to tackle tea's ""social challenges"". Working conditions were fully in line with global company health and safety standards and met living-wage commitments, it said. Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi and Antoine Gara"
0972d76b932116ba7aea,2021-11-20,Finance firms must aid clients' financial literacy,"Financial illiteracy is not a new issue by any measure. But the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated and exposed vulnerabilities and inequalities in society, including the wide gap between those who know how to manage their finances and those who struggle to do so. If collective action is not taken by both the public and private sector to close these divides, we will see even more pervasive systemic inequalities in Britain and elsewhere. In February 2020 before the pandemic took hold in the UK the country's Financial Conduct Authority revealed that 57 per cent of adults surveyed in a poll felt nervous, overwhelmed, or stressed speaking to financial services providers, or found it hard to find suitable financial products or services. Some 37 per cent struggled to assess financial products or found it difficult to shop around. Several factors contributed to this worrying trend. They include upheavals in retirement funding, following the shift from defined benefit (DB) pension plans to defined contribution (DC) plans. While demands on individuals to make critical financial decisions have increased, the education to inform that decision making has not kept pace. As a financial services industry leader, I have seen these changes happening. According to the Pensions Policy Institute, a leading retirement research organisation, DB scheme closures have led to fewer employees in the private sector being covered by DB schemes. The number of active members in DB schemes has fallen from 3.5m in 2006 to about 1m in 2020. As the way we work evolves, people are increasingly exposed to ""pension savings opportunity gaps"", with gig economy jobs and zero-hours contracts not typically offering retirement benefits. While responsibility for retirement planning has shifted largely to individuals, a prolonged low-interest rate environment has simultaneously eroded people's savings. This has prompted them to take a more active look at their finances overall. While investors today have more choice than ever, fuelled largely by globalisation and technological advances, people need the right tools to be able to understand the opportunities and risks to manage their money and make their money work for them. Support to enhance financial literacy needs a twofold approach. First, companies that offer financial products also need to provide transparent educational materials to help clients make better-informed financial decisions. The journey towards proficient financial literacy must be presented as a critical part of the customer service and embedded in the company's culture. Whatever products or services are offered, companies should consider how those offerings will be received in the market and who will be using them. In addition, organisations should embed financial literacy into their ESG (environment, social and governance) strategy. Resources should be earmarked for independent programmes that support financial literacy at all stages of life, from youth through to adulthood.    My passion for education was a catalyst for me to personally become a founding donor of the Financial Times' Financial Literacy Inclusion Campaign. Working at a publicly traded company, my colleagues and I have looked at how to evolve our ESG strategy to address social issues, with the aim of increasing resources to independently-run, education-focused programmes. As an example, IG Group has an existing partnership with Teach For All, an international non-profit organisation that looks to improve grassroots education. Here in the UK we also partner with Teach First, providing the organisation with funds and access to our people and their knowledge of financial markets. We are evolving to support more financial literacy programmes in the coming months. We have also created a variety of online educational resources for our clients, ranging from technical education to macro analysis of markets for people at varying stages of their investment knowledge. We also take steps to ensure they have a level of understanding before they use the more sophisticated products on our platform. Some products carry more risk than others. The crucial issue is ensuring potential investors are properly informed before they begin online trading. We recognise the need to be collaborative. The private sector must work together and enhance the efforts of public sector organisations furthering financial literacy. Not every product offered on the market will be right for every person. However, enabling people to make choices based on a solid foundation of education will make a considerable difference in improving the overall financial health, not just of individuals but of society at large. Technological innovation and the investment landscape will continue to evolve at pace. Empowering people with the knowledge they need to capitalise on these changes has the potential to be transformational.

Similar campaigns such as the Hampton Alexander review have mainly been directed at boosting numbers of women more broadly in the boardroom. These have been successful in adding to the numbers of female nonexecutives, with more than a third of board seats now occupied by women across the FTSE 350. But campaigners are still concerned about the shortfall in female executives, especially at the highest level, with only nine female CEOs across the FTSE 100. There are also nine female chiefs in the FTSE 250 index of smaller companies. Tara Cemlyn-Jones, co-ordinator and director of 25x25 Limited, a non-profit group, said that women faced different obstacles to becoming CEO than in joining a board. A CEO is normally chosen through a long-term process, and often the candidate has run ""either a big operational area or ... a big team of people"". ""If we only get a handful of companies working well on this [we] will end up with a handful of CEOs,"" she said. ""And we'll be back where we started with six or seven women CEOs. So we needed that critical mass of companies to join."" The 25x25 campaign has been sponsored by Unilever, Admiral, IG Group, BP, NatWest, Morgan Stanley International, GSK, BAE Systems, Deloitte, Linklaters, the Royal Air Force and ITV. Alan Jope, CEO of Unilever, said that it was seeking ""gender balance in our top 500 senior positions by 2025, and [is] keen to learn how we can do even better through partnerships like 25x25"". Signatories have signalled a commitment to ensuring that women are given opportunities at the right time in their career. The plans come after consultation with more than 200 companies, including 90 per cent of the FTSE 100. Best practices regarding succession planning and talent management have been drawn up that look at how to help with the career path to CEO, alongside better accountability and targets. Clear progression routes are seen as important to provide a structure for women to plan their careers. Alison Rose, CEO of NatWest, said that the bank had strong female representation at the most senior levels. ""But our progress does not stop there, we continue to focus on recruiting, advancing and retaining women and working ... to achieve gender balance at the highest levels,"" Rose said.    The group will develop two data tools: a public version to encourage companies, shareholders, stock indices and other organisations to track gender balance at executive levels; and a private benchmarking tool for its members. The data could be used to support indices of companies ranked by gender balance, alongside ESG criteria. Bernard Looney, CEO of BP, said that his group had made good progress on gender parity, ""but we still have more work to hit the target"".

a608f4eee4241ea8f1f4,2021-11-17,Green investors can no longer rely on rules of thumb,"Abattle is raging across finance about the best way to invest in the green transition. And the COP26 summit just raised the stakes through the announcement of a new International Sustainability Standards Board for accounting. Investors will increasingly be able to construct comparable metrics on carbon footprints, throughout the entire value chain and across a whole portfolio. This means that we are heading for a new phase of climate-aligned investing. Up until now, this has been guided for many by several green rules of thumb. But these may be about to change. The first phase, before firms started making commitments, was largely thematic: think betting on renewables and being underweight or excluding fossil fuels in portfolios. This strategy has paid off in the past decade in many ESG portfolios. Broadly diversified low carbon intensity portfolios outperformed the wider market by 0.9 per cent a year between 2010 and 2020 or by 2.4 per cent in Europe, according to UBS Research, although numerous factors have been at work. More recently, a second phase has been characterised by net zero commitments, which have become an important proxy for investors that inform the cost of capital. A working paper by US think-tank FCLT suggests that companies issuing green bonds with a net zero policy enjoyed a 0.08 percentage point ""greenium"" in terms of better pricing than those that did not. But ""there are no relationships or equations that always work"", my former colleague Barton Biggs, the investment strategist, used to say. The usefulness of a net zero policy as a heuristic is unlikely to remain. A flurry of firms has announced net zero policies this year and joined Mark Carney 's alliance of financial companies making commitments on climate change. Big thematic bets also require getting the timing, and thesis, right: investors lost nearly half of the $25bn in clean energy venture capital bets between 2006 and 2011, according to data provider PitchBook. Getting it right in this next phase will demand more of investors in terms of data, metrics, risk tolerances and governance. First, investors will need to shift their focus from a top-down view of the overall sector, to a more bottom-up sense of how individual businesses can abate their carbon footprint. This approach will be mirrored by auditors, regulators and customers, which will seek more detailed data to hold firms accountable. Part of the new armoury will have to be more forward-looking assessments of how well management teams are tackling climate change and what innovations they are relying on. Richard Manley of CPP Investments, the manager of the Canada Pension Plan, has proposed an intriguing idea that could significantly sharpen investor understanding: that firms should conduct an annual Abatement Capacity Assessment, cataloguing their capacity to abate greenhouse gases under three headings: current, long-term and une- conomic. Better data will also enable greater engagement or activism. Some of the most polluting assets are    being taken private without any reduction in actual emissions. This is simply ""paper decarbonisation"". Investors will need better data and comparable metrics, if they are to hold boards accountable. And critically, investors will also need to rethink the playbook of an inflationprotected and diversified portfolio. During previous periods of inflation, energy companies have tended to outperform the broader equity markets. In the 1970s, oil and gas companies were up well over 100 per cent in real terms while the S&P 500 dropped. A similar scenario played out between 2000 and 2010. In the 2000s, renewables were a good hedge for being underweight oil and gas assets, according to a report by fund manager GMO. But the current energy crisis and selloff in long bonds means that this time is likely to be different. The oil and gas stock ETF is up 101 per cent in the past 12 months versus just 18 per cent for the global clean energy ETF. Climate change has brought a new level of complexity to the scenarios that investors need to weigh up. The transition tailwinds will provide investors with large investment opportunities for decades. As climate risk analysis of companies and portfolios moves out of a specialised niche and into the mainstream, savvy investors will need to arm themselves with better climate metrics and new heuristics to construct a climate-aligned portfolio.

8a9ff21ece07ffa6b54c,2021-11-17,Sustainability-linked bonds attract cash and scrutiny,"Fixed income. Corporate responsibility Debt based on ESG pledges has hit $80bn but investors question 'green' credentials The market for sustainability-linked bonds has boomed to reach $80bn in issuance this year, even as some investors question the ""green"" credentials of the debt that can be used to finance an array of corporate initiatives. The first deal in this sector only took place in 2019, but in a sign of its rising appeal among businesses and their debt holders, global issuance has grown almost nine-fold since the end of 2020, according to Environmental Finance. Sustainability-linked bonds lack the more rigorous criteria placed on green bonds, where debt is raised to finance specific green projects. Issuers do not face restrictions on how proceeds are used, but must instead agree to environmental, social and governance targets. Failure to meet those pledges typically results in a step-up in interest payments, raising the issuer's borrowing costs. But examples so far suggest such penalties are relatively small. Israeli generic drugmaker Teva, which has been involved in the US's opioid crisis, recently issued the largest sustainability-linked bond, raising $5bn pegged to targets to increase access to medicines in low and middle-income countries, and to reduce the company's greenhouse gas emissions. Were Teva to fall short of those goals, it would have to fork out just a fraction of a percentage point in higher payments to investors equivalent to less than $10m of additional annual interest. That extra interest would also only apply after the assessment date in May 2026 for bonds expiring just a couple of years later. Matt Todd, who analysed Teva's deal for rating agency S&P Global, said the penalty was ""not material"" to the debt's rating. More significant was the low borrowing cost achieved from rampant investor demand for sustainable debt. ""It's good for their cash flow,"" he said. Broadly, proponents of sustainabilitylinked bonds say the market's fast growth heralds green debt moving into the mainstream, allowing companies to make declarations about sustainability that investors can hold them to, even when they may not have a suitable project to finance themselves via the more established green bond market. However, critics argue that such expansion is more reflective of the market's less strict requirements, allowing companies to brandish their new found ESG commitments without having to do much work to substantiate them. ""I think there is tremendous promise in sustainability-linked bonds,"" said James Rich, a portfolio manager at Aegon. ""But the reality, unfortunately, is that the structures and the penalties for not achieving the targets are mostly not substantial enough to drive real and true change among these companies."" Teva is not an isolated example. The coupon step-up on a $900m bond issued earlier this year by Level 3 Financing, a subsidiary of telecoms company Lumen, was just 0.125 percentage points.    India's UltraTech Cement meanwhile raised $400m through a 10-year sustainability-linked bond in February. The deal included a much larger 0.75 percentage point coupon increase if the company fails to reach a target on reducing carbon emissions. However, the assessment date falls just six months before the debt reaches maturity, making its effect on the company's interest payments negligible, according to people familiar with the bond. Investors remain sceptical about how far the sustainability-linked moniker pushes companies to make meaningful change. ""There is a huge gap between what we need and what we are seeing,"" said Charles Portier, a portfolio manager at Mirova. However, others are more hopeful. Scott Mather, in charge of sustainable investments for asset manager Pimco, forecasts that the wider sustainable bond market including green bonds, social bonds, sustainability-linked bonds and others could rise above $10tn over the next five years from its current level of a little more than $2tn. Mather also said that sustainabilitylinked debt should be seen as the ""big brother"" of the green bond market rather than its smaller sibling. He added: ""The fact companies are committing publicly to sustainability goals is powerful. It creates an expectation among their stakeholders, their customers, employees and investors, that they are committed to sustainability."" These are also early days, and bankers note that despite issuance rising rapidly, it is still nowhere near the amount needed to meet demand. Until that point, borrowers have the upper hand, and that typically means lower borrowing costs and smaller penalties. Penalties are also not the only thing that matters, said Anjuli Pandit at HSBC, the lead bank on both the Teva and UltraTech deals. ""Investors aren't buying it in the hope they get the step-up or that they can punish the company,"" said Pandit, noting more punitive punishments may put issuers off. ""This instrument is about companies asking to be held accountable on these targets and giving investors data to track that. We want that data. We want to open up the door between issuers and investors to get this conversation going."" As issuance increases and the balance of power shifts, investors may ultimately be able to demand more challenging targets, request more granular data or apply harsher penalties. Nonetheless, for now, some investors remain unmoved. Aegon's Rich said: ""We have seen very few examples that have met our requirements to be eligible for our sustainability-themed investment strategies. ""They are just too wishy-washy."" Teva declined to comment. Lumen and UltraTech did not respond to a request for comment. 'The fact companies are committing publicly to [such] goals is powerful'"
b6bdd88bd98e4ce4a504,2021-11-17,Singapore's Temasek puts lab-grown meat and milk on the portfolio menu,"Asset management Temasek, Singapore's state-backed investment company, is pushing further into agriculture technology as the city-state turns to lab-grown meats and milks to achieve greater food security. The state investment company has invested more than $8bn in the sector, including in more than 30 start-ups, almost a quarter of which have achieved a valuation of more than $1bn. Life-science and agribusiness investments make up 10 per cent of Temasek's portfolio, said Anuj Maheshwari, managing director of its agribusiness unit. Temasek's push into the sector comes as Singapore's government pursues a ""30 by 30"" goal of producing 30 per cent of its food domestically by 2030. The coronavirus pandemic has reinforced the south-east Asian city-state's reliance on importing most of its food. Singapore, a country of 5.7m that is slightly smaller than New York City, has little arable land and imports more than 90 per cent of the food it consumes. Investors including Temasek are also attracted to the prospect of producing meat without animal slaughter or envi- ronmental damage, and the sector has enjoyed increasing investment flows over the past few years alongside plantbased alternatives. Temasek chief executive Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, who took over the $282bn state investment company last month, will oversee a commitment to halve the net carbon emissions of its portfolio compared with 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. Temasek this week established the Asia Sustainable Foods platform to speed up the commercialisation of sustainable food, assist companies expanding in the region and educate consumers. ""We would like to find as many companies as possible that we can invest in,"" said Maheshwari. Rapid population growth and urbanisation on top of environmental challenges in Asia have created a greater need for alternative foods and innovative farming technologies than at a global level, he added. Temasek also announced partnerships with Archer-Daniels-Midland, the US food processing group, and German logistics company Cremer to grow alternative food sources. Singapore became the first country to approve a lab-grown meat product last year. US start-up Eat Just, one of Temasek's investments, produced the lab-grown chicken nuggets from animal cells, and served them in several local restaurants this year. Temasek's portfolio also includes alternative milk start-up Perfect Day, indoor farming company Bowery and Apeel, the group behind the invisible plant-based edible skin which dramatically extends the shelf life of foods including avocados and other fruit. One ESG investor based in the citystate said Singapore could provide a template for other regulators. ""When Singapore, which is known for being risk-averse, is approving products like lab-grown meat for commercial use, it makes other regulators around the world take note,"" the investor said.    Population growth and environmental challenges in Asia are increasing the need for alternative foods"
b0f72ff5b002e565ff4f,2021-11-16,Unilever tea sale exposes persistent ESG concerns,"Food & beverage. Divestment Owner of Lipton and PG Tips tries to resolve claim that it did too little after Kenya massacre After he acquired his first tea estate in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, in 1890, Scottish entrepreneur Sir Thomas Lipton set out to bring the drink to the masses by conveying it ""direct from the tea garden to the tea pot"". The operation that Lipton founded became the world's largest tea company and it is now on the block. Unilever, which owns Lipton and other big brands such as PG Tips and Brooke Bond, is conducting a sale process for the tea business as growth has faltered. It has in part retained an integrated business model like Lipton's, owning both brands and tea estates. That means that any buyer of the division, now named Ekaterra, will have to decide how to handle sensitive questions of human rights and fair pay on three large plantations that Unilever owns. Private equity groups including Advent, Carlyle and CVC have been bidding for the division, which has €2bn of annual sales and could fetch £4bn to £5bn, said people briefed on the situation. Second-round bids are due today, though Unilever has said that it is retaining the option of a partnership or an initial public offering. As it manages the sale, Unilever is seeking, behind the scenes, to resolve one issue that has dogged the tea division. Its Kenyan business has launched a review of claims that it failed to adequately help workers affected by an attack on its 8,900-hectare Kericho plantation amid ethnic violence in 2007. Seven people were killed, 56 women raped and many injured in the assault, according to a complaint filed by 218 Kenyans last year with the UN working group on human rights and transnational corporations and the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. They are seeking medical and psychological treatment and compensation. That complaint followed a failed UK civil case: the Court of Appeal in London ruled in 2018 that the matter should be pursued in Kenyan courts and that the claimants had failed to demonstrate that Unilever's UK-based parent company had a duty of care. The Supreme Court denied permission to appeal. Unilever has appointed an independent expert to run its review, said a person briefed on the situation. Affected workers hope for an outcome this year, the person said. Another person said that the review was unconnected with the spin-off. Unilever said: ""Although the UK courts dismissed allegations against Unilever and held that we could not have foreseen the terrible violence after the 2007 elections nor be held accountable, Unilever Tea Kenya nevertheless felt that the right thing to do was to review if any claimants had not received the support it offered to other employees at the time and, if so, to make up for what they missed."" It said that it would co-operate fully with the UN bodies if they investigated. The workers' complaint says their wages were stopped for six months after the attack, while those returning to the plantation received financial help of £80, about one month's wages.    Unilever earlier said that it provided ""significant support"" to victims, including ""compensation in kind"", replacing destroyed property, medical treatment and counselling. While Unilever does not own Sir Thomas Lipton's former plantation in Sri Lanka, it does own estates in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda, where thousands of people live and work. Estates such as these date back to the British colonial model, which established plantations in remote areas, bringing workers and their families from elsewhere, said Sabita Banerji, chief executive of Thirst, an international roundtable for sustainable tea. Workers on such estates ""are completely dependent on the management for their livelihoods"", she said. These workers, and smallholders supplying the commodity, are particularly vulnerable to poverty, she added. Unilever belongs to the industry's Ethical Tea Partnership and says that it has several programmes to tackle tea's ""social challenges"", including women's empowerment schemes that have reached 600,000 people in Kenya and India. It says pay at Kericho is ""significantly above the tea industry average"". More recently, it has come into conflict with Kenyan unions as it automates picking and reduces worker numbers. These issues may affect a sale, said one banker familiar with the process, as potential buyers were concerned about environmental, social and governance problems. Another banker said bidders might be overemphasising these in an attempt to buy Ekaterra more cheaply. Such social problems are among the biggest challenges for global tea brands, said consultant Angela Pryce. ""Those brands are often very price sensitive ... so it's difficult to envisage an easy solution,"" she said. At the same time, the market is slowing as drinkers in wealthier markets switch to alternatives such as coffee, herbal tea and kombucha. Julia Buech, analyst at Mintel, said that black tea had undergone a ""slow but steady long-term decline"" in many western markets, only briefly interrupted by the pandemic. In India and Indonesia, where consumption is rising, Unilever is retaining its tea operations and will also keep its iced-tea partnership with PepsiCo. But upmarket and herbal tea brands such as Pukka, T2 and Tazo will join Ekaterra. There is much riding on the sale for Unilever. Its shares have fallen 5.7 per cent since Alan Jope took over as chief executive in 2019 and it is seen as a potential target for activist investors. ""Shareholders are unhappy with the returns they are getting out of Unilever ... Management are under pressure,"" said Martin Deboo, analyst at Jefferies. The tea disposal will be the largest since Jope took charge. Yet some observers suggest Unilever has missed a trick. Jamie Isenwater, founding partner at fund managers Ash Park Capital, which owns a stake, said: ""It's a case of the right strategies rather than the right categories ... there's a lot you can do in tea.""

7d465cd73b4e7e034279,2021-11-15,Exchanges sign up to boost climate funding and disclosure,"Sustainability Platforms where companies raise capital also see a role in helping them to allocate to decarbonisation projects, writes Jeremy Grant W hen the 450 institutions that make up the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz) told this month's COP26 climate conference they could deliver $100tn to help economies transition to green energy, attention was focused on the banks, fund managers, and insurers that had signed up. But the signatories also included stock exchanges signalling an increasing desire by the world's bourses to play a bigger role in pushing companies to decarbonise. On the same day that Gfanz was touting its commitments, four exchanges from South Africa, Mexico, Luxembourg and Hong Kong signed up to the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance. This is a group of financial services companies committed to the goal of global net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, and part of Gfanz. Two other bourses, the London Stock Exchange (LSE ) and Singapore Exchange (SGX) became founder members of the alliance earlier this year. Mark Carney, UN special envoy on climate action and finance and the driving force behind Gfanz sees their involvement as key: ""Stock exchanges are critical market infrastructure that are essential for investors to manage the risks and seize the opportunities in the climate transition."" So far, most of the focus on how to finance the transition away from fossil fuels has been on the sources of funding such as the banks and asset managers that allocate funds to companies that they believe can deliver returns for tens of millions of pension-holders and other investors. However, stock exchanges' increasing engagement with the issue is happening not only because they are the platforms on which companies, or issuers, raise some of that capital, but also because of their role in overseeing the disclosures that their listed companies make under regulatory requirements. Such disclosures have long been financial but are now increasingly tied to sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Companies are increasingly reporting on their emissions under recommendations drawn up by the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD), which provides a framework for companies to issue climate-related financial information. ""The support of stock exchanges for climate related disclosures will help ensure capital is allocated in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" Carney has noted. SGX, which made sustainability reporting mandatory for its companies in 2016, was the only exchange member of the TCFD when the body was first designing its disclosure framework. ""Having those early insights into how climate change and reporting would be shaped was helpful in how we approached our market,"" says Herry Cho, head of sustainability and sustainable finance at SGX. Ultimately, pressure on companies to disclose climate data is coming from big investors, such as asset managers and pension funds which are members of Gfanz. A recent survey by FTSE Russell, a stock index provider owned    by the LSE , found that 84 per cent of asset owners globally are ""implementing or evaluating sustainable investment considerations"" in 2021, up from a little over half, 53 per cent, in 2018. At an event hosted by the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSE ) at COP26 in Glasgow, Chiara Caprioli, senior business development manager at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange , said: ""What we're seeing is an increase in mandatory disclosures so that investors can allocate funds to the most value-added opportunities and that includes on sustainability performance and metrics,"" It was not always this way. When the SSE was established in Geneva in 2009 under the auspices of Unctad, the UNsupported Principles for Responsible Investment and other UN bodies its co-ordinator, Anthony Miller, recalls a slow start. ""You could find lots of organisations like the standard-setting bodies and the UN engaged with sustainability, but there was sort of a deafening silence from exchanges"", he says. ""Yet issuers look to exchanges for guidance for everything, and we felt exchanges should be speaking to issuers on this topic. So, it was a natural role for exchanges to play."" This prompted the SSE to come up with a template that exchanges could use to get started with the basics of sustainability reporting. Called ""model guidance"", it was issued in 2015. At the time, less than a tenth of stock exchanges around the world were providing guidance on reporting ESG information. This year, 60 of the 114 stock exchanges that the SSE tracks or 53 per cent of the total had published ESG reporting guidance for their listed companies, using the model guidance in some form. Last month, the LSE became the latest to do so. It issued guidance for its companies based on a version of the model guidance on climate disclosure that the SSE had produced in June, in line with the TCFD. This becomes mandatory for some UK companies next year. Exchange executives acknowledge there is a risk of fragmentation in the disclosure standards echoing the concerns that many companies and investors have about the acronym ""soup"" of ESG and sustainability standards. But they believe bourses can help by working together to drive the standardisation of data. ""We don't have to wait for the standard-setters,"" says David Harris, the LSE 's group head of sustainable business. ""We have 'soft influence' that can be brought to bear on the process."" Some exchanges in less-developed economies caution that local conditions in their markets must be given adequate consideration as the process continues. ""Standards typically are crafted through a 'developed world' lens, and some social and other contextual factors such as the ones we have in South Africa get overlooked,"" says Leila Fourie , chief executive of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. She can trace the exchange's early engagement with sustainability back to 2005 when it became the first bourse in the world to launch a sustainability-linked stock index. ""We need standards that reflect a 'whole of world' approach when it comes to standardsetting,"" Fourie says. Stock exchanges are essential for investors to seize the opportunities in the climate transition"
303e87cea69b52fd3eed,2021-11-15,Can executive bonuses help to reduce emissions?,"FT BIG READ. COP26 Senior executives' pay is increasingly linked to sustainability targets rather than solely financial performance. But critics are sceptical that vague, long-term goals will amount to meaningful change. The greening of Schneider Electric started in 2005. The French electrical equipment group announced it would review its ""social and environment performance"" and set up a ""planet and society barometer"". In 2008 it even rebranded itself in lurid green. ""If you measure it, it happens,"" Jean-Pascal Tricoire explained to Les Echos, the French business newspaper, in 2007, a year after taking over as chief executive. Tricoire's own pay packet also has an increasingly green tinge. In recent years, his bonuses and long-term share grants have been tied to goals based on the barometer or its successor programme ? such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions ? plus the group's performance on environmental, social and governance measures across a range of external indices. In 2020, a fifth of Tricoire's total incentive pay ? some €1.6m, including the value of shares from his long-term incentive plan ? was due to his efforts to hit such targets. As climate change has advanced up the boardroom agenda, so, inexorably, it has started to find its way into the incentives of senior executives. That has raised questions, not only about the clarity and solidity of the underlying goals and the ease with which chief executives might hit them, but about the purpose and effectiveness of monetary rewards as a way of changing corporate behaviour. For now absolute numbers of companies using climate targets to calculate chief executives' bonuses and long-term incentives remain low: just 28 companies in the FTSE 100, and only 36 in the S&P 500, according to ISS ESG, the responsible investment arm of proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. But from a low base, the number of companies using climate pay targets more than doubled between 2019 and 2020. A survey by Deloitte in September suggested a further 24 per cent of companies polled expected to link their long-term incentive plans for executives to net zero or climate measures over the next two years. ""We have not seen that sort of increase since TSR became the measure in vogue"" in the early 2000s, says Phillippa O'Connor, a partner at PwC, who advises companies on executive rewards, referring to total shareholder return, the metric of choice for tying executives' incentives to financial performance. The push to integrate climate goals, and wider ESG targets, into pay plans has been led by consumer companies such as Unilever. Investors have also intensified the pressure on oil and gas groups such as Royal Dutch Shell to follow suit. According to ISS ESG, 39 per cent of energy companies in the world's biggest indices had incorporated climate targets into their chief executives' pay by last year, the highest proportion of any sector. Harlan Zimmerman, senior partner at Cevian Capital, an activist investment group, sees the introduction of targeted pay as a ""forcing mechanism"" to change mindsets about climate change. Others are more sceptical. Alex Edmans, a finance professor at London Business School (LBS), favours paying chief executives with shares that they must hold after they leave to nudge them to take decisions in the longerterm interests of the company. ""When you [set specific goals], you get this problem of hitting the target but missing the point,"" he says.    When earnings per share growth was popular as an executive goal, for instance, bonus-hunting managers tended to fixate on short-term expansion. Research also shows that when too many targets are added to incentive schemes, executives start to concentrate on the most obvious opportunities for reward ? almost always financial growth, which carries the biggest weight in pay plans. Yet investors continue to add new targets to their wishlists. Other studies have also suggested that executives receive more generous payouts on non-financial targets than they do when judged on precise financial achievements, perhaps because they are often harder to measure and are more subjective. Climate targets also face an obvious snag not shared with shorter-term strategic goals. Companies' environmental goals often have an understandably long horizon ? 2030, 2040, or even 2050 ? but chief executives' tenure is much shorter. An S&P 500 chief executive holds office, on average, for less than 10 years. ""Like everything to do with executive remuneration, it isn't easy to get this right,"" says Edward Mason of Generation Investment Management, the sustainability-focused fund company with $36bn of assets under management. ""There are risks of perverse incentives and easy remuneration that investors should be on the lookout for."" 'Meaningful and measurable' Some red flags are already flapping, according to pay analysts and investors. One is a concentration on tactical, shortterm targets, such as operational efficiency, rather than more strategic, longterm goals such as emissions reductions. A second danger signal is a focus mainly on vaguer discretionary measures of progress, such as ""improving sustainability"" sometimes mixed with other qualitative goals. A third is the lack of transparency. ""A lot of targets we are seeing are still quite vague,"" says Tom Gosling, an executive fellow in the finance department at LBS, ""and about 'making progress towards [a goal]', as opposed to pinning yourself to a final number."" Honeywell, for instance, has committed to become carbon neutral by 2035 in its core activities, yet progress towards these commitments is not linked in detail to its executive pay plan. The US industrial group paid its chief executive Darius Adamczyk an annual bonus of $2.5m for 2020, of which 20 per cent was based on the remuneration committee's assessment of a raft of goals including driving ""a robust ESG programme"". ASML, the Netherlands-based semiconductor equipment group whose shares are quoted on Nasdaq, has promised to cut its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from operations to zero by 2025 as part of the ""climate and energy"" criteria for executive bonuses. It benchmarks itself against other semiconductor companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. But it refuses to reveal actual targets and achievement levels, saying they are ""commercially or strategically sensitive"". It is reviewing its policy following challenges from investors to improve transparency. Angeli Benham, senior global ESG manager at Legal & General Investment Management, which has $1.8tn of assets under management, is among those calling for climate goals to be ""meaningful, material, and measurable"". The two largest elements of performance pay are the annual bonus, and long-term incentive plan (LTIP), which typically runs for three years. The level of enthusiasm within boards to attach more conditions to their chief executives' incentives varies. ISS ESG measured the highest impact of climate factors in pay at companies in the French and German benchmark indices, and the lowest in Asia and the US. One size doesn't fit all Not one of the attempts by US investors to tie executive pay to ESG measures attracted significant support at this year's annual meetings, according to Glass Lewis, another proxy adviser. It registered a drop in shareholder support for ESG targets in pay to 12 per cent, on average, compared with 17 per cent last year and 22 per cent in 2019. Glass Lewis itself recommended support for just one proposal this year: that General Motors should report if and how the carmaker had met pay criteria laid down by Climate Action 100+, a network of investor organisations. Lila Holzman, from the lobby group As You Sow, told GM's board meeting that shareholders wanted chief executive Mary Barra and her team ""to focus their actions on quickly achieving Parisaligned goals. But, her plea to embed climate change targets in executive pay fell on deaf ears. Defending itself in the proxy statement issued to shareholders ahead of its annual meeting, GM said it had taken its sustainability performance into account in setting pay since 2017. Even though Glass Lewis judged the GM    proposal ""not to be overly burdensome"", given the carmaker's existing commitments to climate goals, it was rejected with only 16.3 per cent of GM shares voting in favour. The GM case highlights that every company is different when it comes to tying climate targets to pay, making a blanket approach unworkable. But successfully adopting bespoke plans can be arduous and complicated. For instance, NatWest, the UK-based bank, has set conditions on its issue of stock to Alison Rose, chief executive, that include reducing carbon emissions from its direct operational footprint and increasing funding for clients' climate and sustainable finance initiatives. Helen Cook, NatWest's chief human resources officer, told a recent Deloitte webinar that adding climate conditions into executive pay was ""a new frontier"". She said she and her team ""probably had 10 iterations of conversations around climate before we got our first climate measures"". They had to revisit those at least twice after the bank's remuneration committee had discussed them, ""because people were trying to define and to discern what was measurable and importantly what is auditable"". Advocates of linking climate targets to executive pay say, done well, it can pay off. Dutch and UK investors have in recent years pushed Shell, for example, to clarify its path to carbon reduction. Before a Dutch court ordered the group to increase its emissions cuts in May ? a decision against which Shell is appealing ? the group had strengthened its pay policy in line with the aim of limiting rises in global average temperature to 1.5C. Chief executive Ben van Beurden's annual bonus, for instance, will in future link to its greenhouse gas abatement target, and 20 per cent of his longterm incentive payout will be tied to Shell's energy transition, up from 10 per cent in previous years. Schneider Electric is another example. Its 2005 commitment to ""spotlight"" corporate responsibility had evolved by 2012 into formal ESG targets within Tricoire's bonus and long-term share awards. The weighting of the sustainability targets in his annual bonus increased in recent years from 5 per cent, to 6 per cent, and then in 2019 to 20 per cent, the same as for his longterm rewards. That helped to double the total value of incentives he received by working towards sustainability targets from €851,840 in 2018 to €1.6m in 2020. During that time, the board responded to shareholder pressure by tying the long-term incentive plan's sustainability targets to external measures and simplifying the number of criteria used overall. The group says it hit or surpassed two of its four climate targets set in 2018, en route to its overall aim of becoming carbon neutral in its operations by 2025. Tricoire is receiving a higher overall payout partly because the portion attributed to non-financial measures has increased and because Schneider Electric's shares have performed well. But in a sign of how difficult it was to meet those non-financial targets as they became more ""meaningful, material, and measurable"", the rate at which he achieved those goals actually dropped. Shell, Schneider Electric, Honeywell, General Motors, Unilever, NatWest, ASML: these are large companies that attract the attention of big institutional investors. As significant emitters, Unilever, GM and Shell are on Climate Action 100+'s list of ""focus companies"" that account for 80 per cent of global corporate industrial emissions and whose governance and executive pay policies will be scrutinised against their environmental commitments. Small company syndrome The danger, investors acknowledge, is that smaller companies, or companies for which climate change is less immediately significant, will reward their executives by implementing less rigorous programmes with easy-to-hit targets. LGIM's Benham says she expects most smaller companies to take the lead from the improving practice of larger counterparts, but she admits: ""Our focus tends to be with the largest companies where we devote a lot more engagement time. So there may be a multitude of smaller companies that put anything in there and get away with it."" A more fundamental criticism is that executive pay may not even be the right tool for encouraging this type of corporate change. Tax, regulation, and carbon pricing initiatives that can only come from governments, or, for that matter, high-profile court cases, could be more effective. Investors argue, though, that challenges to executive rewards attract board attention. US ""say on pay"" rules mandate a nonbinding vote on remuneration. By using those rules to push for ESG targets in executive pay, investors say they can force the climate question on to the agenda of directors. Encouraging the incorporation of climate targets into senior executive pay also signals to more junior managers that it is important    and trickles down to other staff. At Schneider Electric, 10 per cent of the bonus of all 58,000 staff has been tied to sustainability targets since 2019. As for the criticism that traditional financial ambitions over-rule or contradict climate targets ? which might, for instance, involve reducing output to cut emissions ? Generation Investment Management's Mason says: ""Good management is about reconciling the short term and the long term and understanding where things run up against each other and finding a path through that."" Gosling, of LBS, argues that if environmental measures ? and, indeed, social and governance improvements ? support longer-term shareholder value, there may be better ways to encourage executives than tweaking rewards. If, however, ESG initiatives conflict with long-term value, then ""executive pay will never be the solution"". ""We're kidding ourselves if we say we can solve a climate crisis without changing the economic guide rails for companies at all; I'm very sceptical about using executive pay to set climate targets that are sufficient,"" he says. ""We hope for far, far too much from this intervention.""

7bb7eb8074c075b51634,2021-11-15,Perrodos add funding heft to Rolls-Royce nuclear plan,"Energy A billionaire French oil family's decision to back Rolls-Royce's plans for a fleet of mini nuclear power plants is part of a set of investments predicated on a renaissance for atomic power, according to their investment adviser. Sean Benson, director of BNF Capital, the London-based investment office owned by members of the Perrodo family, said recent investments had focused on uranium as ""we feel the energy transition is not possible without a heavy reliance on nuclear power, hence also the Rolls-Royce investment"". ""We think nuclear is required as part of the net zero carbon targets that everyone wants to meet,"" added Benson, who has been advising the family on its multibillion-dollar office portfolio for several years. The Perrodo family, whose estimated £3.9bn fortune was built on investments in oil and gas, emerged last week as one of two private backers of the UK aero engine group's plans to build small modular reactors. The funding helped to unlock backing from the British government for the initiative, part of a new push into nuclear power designed to help the country meet its net zero carbon targets. The family's main asset, oil and gas group Perenco, was founded by the late Hubert Perrodo, an entrepreneur descended from Breton fishermen who also amassed several wine estates in Bordeaux. Perenco's operations today span projects in west Africa, Latin America and Asia. The group, also a significant producer in the UK's North Sea, is run separately by the family. Benson said the decision to back the Rolls-Royce initiative was not driven by a move to diversify from fossil fuels. BNF Capital two years ago first approached the UK group, whose reactors power the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine fleet. Benson said they considered investing in other SMR technologies but Rolls-Royce's design was particularly attractive as it used existing technology in the form of pressurised water reactors seen in large power stations. A separate vehicle, BNF Resources, controls the investment in RR SMR. ""It is putting [existing technology] together differently and more efficiently ... We are looking at it as an investment that stands up in its own right. It has the ESG angle,"" said Benson. Other investments include lithium and nickel, commodities required in the manufacture of electric vehicles. Benson said not enough capital was being put into the ""mining of these enabling commodities to keep up with demand"" and that the expectation was that prices would continue to rise in order to incentivise production. BNF Capital has seeded two fund vehicles active in what Benson called ""energy transition commodities"", the Tees River Uranium Fund and Tees River Critical Resources Fund, both managed by Benson. 'We think nuclear is required as part of the net zero carbon targets that everyone wants to meet'"
a143fd7b4bf9ec8d00fd,2021-11-13,Don't fall for the population growth myth,"I f you were at COP26 [...] I f you were at COP26 this week you might have seen a massive (but still quite cute) inflatable baby wearing a slogan T-shirt (""smaller families, cooler planet"") floating around the international climate summit. It was installed by campaign group Population Matters to highlight what it sees as the growing problem of overpopulation. Go to the group's website and you can see the numbers. Today's global population is about 7.7bn. We are ""still adding an extra 80m each year and are headed to 10bn by mid-century"", it says. Scary, isn't it? It's also probably nonsense. One of the oddest things about the population debate is the ongoing insistence that we must worry about fast-rising population numbers when even a cursory check of the numbers suggests rather the opposite: that one of the biggest challenges for humanity may soon be falling populations. The UN has downgraded its peak population forecast to 10.9bn by 2100 and notes that the world population is growing at a slower pace than at any time since 1950 thanks to fast-falling fertility. So many countries have fallen to or below replacement rates that the majority of population growth from now on ""will be concentrated in just nine countries"", says the UN. However, look down the list of those nine and you might wonder. One of the main drivers of the growth is supposed to be India. But India's fertility rate is already down to 2.179. That's barely over the replacement rate (2.1). A study from The Lancet last year suggested the global population will peak at 9.7bn in the 2060s and be well below 9bn by 2100. All this matters. If population forecasts are out by 10 to 20 per cent, so are most other long-term forecasts. But worse, we are preparing for the wrong future one filled with too few, not too many, people, and one in which such growth as we do see will be driven not by people being born but by old people not dying. There's a view that falling and ageing populations are deflationary. We are told you can see this clearly in Japan, where deflation appears to have taken an irreversible hold over the economy. This makes some sense. After all, the old are not accumulators. The older they get the more aggregate demand falls and the lower inflation goes. But it isn't correct. The first thing is that low inflation in Japan isn't necessarily a function of an ageing population it might just be a function of the same trends that have driven low inflation everywhere else for the past few decades (globalisation and cheap labour). It's also not clear that aggregate demand does fall as people age. The over-80s may not be buying much in the way of new cars but their need for (often state financed) medical care, mobility and other devices and labour is huge. Darrell Bricker, author of Empty Planet, predicts the global population of over-80s will be up 148 per cent in 50 years but the working population will be up only 2 per cent. If that happens, will prices (particularly of labour) be up or down? Quite. Maybe think of today's labour shortages, sharp wage rises and supply driven inflationary impulses as a taste of things to come, says Bricker. This bout might fade, but with working age populations already falling in some countries, the longterm trend will not.    With that in mind we should turn to today's inflation. In the UK, CPI inflation is 3.1 per cent. In Germany it is 4.5 per cent. In the US it is rising at the fastest pace for 30 years 6.2 per cent. And in China factory gate inflation is running at 13.5 per cent a 26-year high. Some of that inflation will end up in consumer prices. Central banks still tell us that this is ""transitory"" (an increasingly meaningless concept) but investors look like they know better. Low interest rates have pushed them into property, infrastructure and equities for some years. But the sharp rise in inflation which means real interest is lower than ever has given the shift a new impetus. Look at launches and fundraisings in the investment trust sector recently and you will see what I mean. A record £6.3bn was raised in the first half of this year with much of it heading for what Ian Sayer of the AIC called ""income generating alternatives such as renewable energy assets and infrastructure"". Nothing says ""inflation fears"" like a scramble for income. The good news for investment trust investors is that you don't have to take a risk on overhyped new stuff (there may be a bubble building in renewables, for example) to get a good income. There are 23 equity trusts in the UK that yield 4 per cent or more. Analysts at Stifel say most offer some exposure to overseas markets rather than just the UK although just the UK is fine too and many have excellent long-term records of delivering annual dividend growth. You can get 4.1 per cent from JPMorgan Claverhouse, for example, or, if you want to be a bit more international, 4.8 per cent from Murray International. Also of interest might be BlackRock Energy and Resources (4.1 per cent). However, if the trend for new trust launches continues, there's one I'd really like to see. How about a fossil fuel rescue trust? It would come with an acceptance that COP or no COP we will be using fossil fuels for many decades and with that in mind would buy out the assets that everyone else is busy backing off hopefully on the cheap. It would be for retail investors only, since most institutions are too crazed by conventional tickbox ESG metrics to consider this kind of thing, and would produce a couple of benefits. It would keep oil and gas assets on the public markets if there is one area that needs radical transparency, it is this. It would help out all those companies that are being bullied by ESG committees to divest dirty stuff. And, of course, while the assets would be in decline (no new exploration or drilling) it would provide us with a medium-term high yield one that we can squirrel away to pay the exorbitant wages the few remaining young people in the world will demand to look after us when we are in our 80s.

f0e03daba4ca7e544ea0,2021-11-13,"Investing with a clearer, greener conscience","INVESTMENT TRUSTS ETHICAL INVESTING Funds differ greatly on what constitutes ESG investing For green or ethical investors, the investment trust universe can be challenging territory. A far smaller proportion of funds are clearly badged ""sustainable"" or ESG (environmental, social and governance) than are available among openended vehicles. Of the 40 ethical funds listed in broker Interactive Investor's recently updated ACE 40 shortlist, only three are closedended the same three that appeared last year. Fund EcoMarket, an ethical fund search engine for advisers, includes only 33 investment trusts within its total listing of about 450 funds that market themselves as sustainable. The Fund EcoMarket shortlist is heavily dominated by explicitly environmental renewable energy trusts, with some broader options such as Impax Environmental Markets, Premier Miton Global Renewables and Jupiter Green. It also includes a sprinkling of specialist property funds with a social focus, plus healthcare and forestry trusts. Some trusts are taking ESG criteria a stage further. Andrew McHattie, publisher of the independent Investment Trust Newsletter, says a number of the more socially focused trusts now ""have an explicit aim to provide social good or to contribute to charities"". He gives the example of Civitas Social Housing trust, which details the social benefits of its portfolio in a separate Social Impact Report alongside its annual report. ""Healthcarefocused Syncona supports healthcare charities. Home Reit provides accommodation for the homeless and Schroder BSC Social Impact is focused on housing, health and social care,"" he adds. For UK retail investors seeking investment trusts with an ethical and environmental flavour, these specialist funds have been an obvious place to start looking particularly as property and infrastructure assets can provide both a handy income and useful diversification for an equity portfolio. But what is available among broader-based conventional equity trusts? A few have explicit ESG elements at the core of their proposition, says McHattie, though it's not necessarily obvious when they do. ""One example of such 'embedded ESG' is Mobius Investment Trust, which deliberately seeks out companies that can benefit from its help to improve their ESG credentials."" A handful have recently changed their mandates to embrace an ESG approach. In February, Keystone's board gave the trust's mandate to fund manager Baillie Gifford and rechristened it Keystone Positive Change. Last year, the small-company specialist Odyssean Investment Trust put in place more rigorous ESG due diligence rules. BlackRock Sustainable American Income and Dunedin Income Growth have both formally adopted an ESG focus in recent months. New launches of dedicated sustainable equity trusts have fared less well, however. Liontrust's recent ESG-focused equity trust launch flopped this summer, while Schroder British Opportunities had raised just onethird of its target £250m when it launched in December last year amid a challenging lockdown market.    Despite these setbacks, analysts say ESG considerations are becoming embedded in the governance of investment trusts. ""ESG reporting is built into most manager-board interactions these days,"" McHattie adds. Indeed, as Ewan Lovett- Turner, head of investment companies research at Numis, points out: ""Many trusts have ESG characteristics integrated into their approach, and firms such as Abrdn have placed heavy emphasis on governance for many years."" However, fund managers have different interpretations of what constitutes an ESG approach. ""The majority of investment managers are focused on the 'G' or governance issues, which includes remuneration packages,"" says Simon Elliott, head of investment companies research at Winterflood. Where more consideration is given to environmental or social factors, he says, the key discussion is around managers' stance on engagement or exclusion. Those who believe in engagement investing in companies involved in controversial industries such as mining or oil and gas often argue that the leading players have to be part of the solution. In this view, fund managers, as important shareholders, can push companies in the right direction. Exclusion avoiding the shares to ensure a green portfolio does not necessarily lead to a better outcome for the planet, they say. Some take a mixed approach. Dunedin Income Growth only allows investment in oil companies if they meet strict criteria, and excludes tobacco companies. Finsbury Growth & Income steers clear of both industries. Until recently, the evidence suggested investment trusts were behind the curve in embracing ESG. However, Elliott concludes: ""We suspect there is growing demand for mandates demonstrating genuine ESG credentials."""
431b0850b385f6921ef1,2021-11-13,Renewable energy adds fuel to investment trusts,"INVESTMENT TRUSTS INVESTING Net asset values are calculated on future power price estimates Investment trusts focused on infrastructure, particularly those involved in renewable energy projects, have boomed this year as income-hungry investors and those wishing to back the energy transition have flocked to participate in record numbers of share issues. There is little sign of this momentum losing pace. One energy efficiency trust, Atrato Onsite Energy, is in the process of launching, as well another more generalist trust with renewable components. ""There is an awful lot of investment needed in the renewable sector and it will likely raise an awful lot more money yet,"" says James Carthew, head of investment company research at research firm QuotedData. Traditional renewable energy infrastructure trusts make money by owning renewable assets and producing and selling energy. This means the income the trusts earn will fluctuate according to how much energy they produce (which includes weather impacts) and power prices, though many trusts hedge against price fluctuations. Many also have income from UK government subsidies, though these are being phased out as the cost of producing renewable energy has fallen. The weighted average net yield of the renewable energy infrastructure sector was more than 5.2 per cent on November 8, compared with an average of 4.6 per cent for traditional infrastructure or 3.5 per cent for global equity income funds, according to Winterflood data. But David Merriam, investment manager at Tilney Smith & Williamson, suggests investors might wish to tread carefully. The weighted average sector premium to net assets is almost 10 per cent. ""They are relatively expensive, reflecting demand for assets with favourable ESG [environmental, social and governance] characteristics and a desperate need for reliable income,"" Merriam says, adding that if you pay a premium of 15 per cent or higher for a trust, you risk a substantial de-rating (a narrowing of premium) and capital loss that may even exceed the income generated, depending on the holding period. Many renewables trusts have seen net asset value growth in recent years because demand for green energy has driven down the discount rates used to value assets and trusts have extended the life of their assets. Merriam says: ""There is limited scope for further pulling on these levers and thus net asset value growth may reasonably be expected to slow in future years."" Renewable energy net asset values are calculated according to long-term power price estimates, which could drive their value down, according to Mick Gilligan, head of managed portfolio services at Killik and Co. The cost of producing renewable energy has fallen substantially, and much faster than many people expected, with implications for overall power prices. ""If power prices decline materially, this will result in lower asset values and lower share prices of renewable infrastructure funds,"" he says.    Only three of the established renewable energy generating infrastructure trusts have a record of delivering their target total return rate every year: The Renewables Infrastructure Group, Greencoat UK Wind and Bluefield Solar Income Fund, according to analysis by brokerage Numis. Ryan Hughes, head of investment research at AJ Bell, recommends that those looking for infrastructure exposure opt for an established player, such as The Renewables Infrastructure Group, as they tend to have a high proportion of operational assets which makes income more reliable. However, the trust is trading at a high premium to net asset value 16.3 per cent on November 8. Newer, more specialised renewable energy infrastructure trusts are also growing quickly and pay healthy yields. Gore Street Energy Storage and Gresham House Energy Storage are providing batteries to help balance the power grid and both yield over 5.5 per cent. Harmony Energy Income, which completed its IPO on November 5, is the latest addition, with contracts lined up to use Tesla's battery storage technology. SDCL Energy Efficiency Income Trust, meanwhile, which had a yield of 4.8 per cent on November 8, according to Winterflood, provides on-site solar energy generation for commercial and industrial buildings."
dfc307cd9a0bcd538f02,2021-11-13,UK green funds attract record retail inflows,"INVESTING Regulator aims to clean up inconsistent labelling of products UK retail investors have poured money in to responsible funds at an accelerating pace this year, even as the country's financial watchdog warned that inconsistent standards could leave buyers unsure about what lies behind ethical investment labels. Asset managers drew £4.3bn in retail money in to their responsible funds in the three months to the end of September, according to the Investment Association, the highest quarterly total on record. The flows made up a third of the industry's total retail sales in the quarter. But the green bonanza comes with concerns that some funds do not live up to their responsible branding. At the start of November the Financial Conduct Authority launched a process to clean up the labelling and disclosure around sustainable investment products warning that more consistency was needed so consumers can make informed choices. ""We have previously highlighted the risk of misleading ... claims by products and providers,"" the FCA said. ""Without common standards, clear terminology and accessible product classification and labelling, there is a risk that consumers find it difficult to navigate the landscape of products and assess product suitability."" A recent survey by the Association of Investment Companies found two-thirds of selfdirected investors consider environmental, social and governance-related factors before deploying their cash, with climate change ranking first among their concerns. The investment industry's push to respond to this demand with green products and marketing has intensified questions over the best way for money managers to pursue environmental objectives. Some asset managers favour owning oil stocks and using their role as shareholders to push boards for change, for instance, whereas others prefer to avoid these shares altogether. At the same time, experts are also debating the climate credentials of different technologies and energy sources. The many differing approaches to climatefriendly investing can make it difficult for retail investors and their advisers to find products that match their values, according to analysts. In their rush to go green, some fund managers have made proposals that, the FCA said, are ""poorly drafted"" and ""contain claims that do not bear scrutiny"". The funds industry has acknowledged the need for clear communication, and said it welcomed the FCA's move towards standardised labels. ""Today's savers want confidence that when they buy a responsible and sustainable investment product, it matches their expectations,"" said Galina Dimitrova, director for investments and capital markets at the Investment Association, the asset management trade body.    ""We recognise the need for clearer, more consistent disclosure,"" she said. The FCA called for ""initial views"" on disclosure and labelling, with the aim of consulting on new rules by mid-2022. In the mean time, savers have continued to funnel billions of pounds each month into ESGstyle investments. Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK's largest investment platform, said net flows into responsible funds in the first nine months of this year were 6,000 per cent higher than the same period five years ago. The percentage of assets held in responsible funds has ticked steadily upward to reach 5.5 per cent across UK fund managers, according to the IA's data, which counts sustainability-focused funds as well as those built around broader ESG or impact investing criteria."
07ca73fc479b943c1a48,2021-11-13,Buying back better,"Report | From Gucci Vault to Valentino Vintage, luxury labels get in on the pre-owned act. By Annachiara Biondi A s a fashion-curious teenager growing up in a provincial Italian city, shopping for vintage clothing was for me a rare and treasured occasion. I remember driving with my mum and sister to Forlì for the biannual vintage fair, an expedition that would last a whole afternoon as we trawled, often multiple times, the expanse of stalls. It was there, among the mix of motorcycles and Bakelite jewellery, that I found my first treasure: a 1970s Celine box bag in smooth burgundy leather, which I bought for €150 after long and hard consideration. However, not everyone has the time or inclination to hunt down that dream piece. And with demand for secondhand items rising precipitously the second-hand luxury goods market has been outpacing growth in the overall luxury goods market for at least the past five years, according to Bain luxury brands are now getting in on the action, and making it easier for shoppers to buy bona fide vintage wares. In the past two weeks alone, Jean Paul Gaultier has launched a vintage selection on its website; Valentino has announced that customers can now return their Valentino garments to selected boutiques, which will begin selling authenticated pieces under the new Valentino Vintage label; and Diesel has launched Diesel Second Hand, making pre-owned, restored jeans bought back from customers available for purchase. On Gucci Vault, which was launched in September, customers can purchase a selection of reconditioned Gucci items, from handbags to homeware. Philippa K, Rachel Comey and Marques'Almeida are also now offering resale on their websites, the first two as peer-to-peer marketplaces. These vintage offshoots are small and unlikely to impact the bottom line in any meaningful way for now. But they are an effective way to draw in new, climate-conscious consumers and boost customer loyalty, analysts say. ""Younger demographics are focused on making sure the brands they are buying into are performing well on ESG [environmental, social and governance] criteria,"" says Kathryn Parker, senior associate in luxury goods research at Jefferies. ""One thing brands can do that is very visible is to launch projects in resale."" For Mark Cross, second-hand has already become a significant business. In 2019, the US leather goods label launched a vintage section on its website with pieces bought back from customers, a segment that now represents almost 10 per cent of sales, according chief executive Ulrik Garde Due. Prices range from £280 for leather wallets to £2,500 for handbags which is comparable to the cost of new items. Cannibalisation of sales of new bags hasn't been an issue. On the contrary, 20 per cent of users entering the site for vintage end up buying products at full price, says Garde Due. ""It's still mindboggling to me as to why nobody else has really jumped in,"" he adds. Diesel chief executive Massimo Piombini seems genuinely surprised by the response to the launch of Diesel Second Hand. On launch day, November 3, the brand sold 50 of 150 pairs of reconditioned jeans, priced between €75 and €115 about half the cost of a new pair. ""We were expecting much less, to be honest. If this is the trend, this is not just going to be a good project, but a very profitable one,"" he says, speaking on Zoom from the company's headquarters in Breganze, Italy. But 50 pairs of jeans is a drop in the ocean for a brand as large as Diesel. Preparing used denim for sale is also laborious: the label has only processed about 25 per cent of the 900 pairs of jeans it has bought back since July,    as the process of reconditioning and sanitation is done by a single supplier. Piombini concedes that the project is expensive in terms of logistics and reconditioning. ""The real challenge will be rolling it out in other locations,"" he says. Customers who purchase Diesel Second Hand products are likely to be enticed by price, as well as gaining access to styles the brand doesn't produce any more. According to Boston Consulting Group, the number-one reason listed by consumers for second-hand consumption, even at a luxury price point, remains affordability. But in the case of some brands, there is little price difference between second-hand and new. On Gucci Vault, a vintage Jackie Square G handbag from the 1970s costs £2,110. A Jackie 1961 model costs £1,750 new. So who are luxury brands targeting with these new ventures? ""I'm not the target audience because for me it's a hobby,"" explains Sarah Kate Byrne, a vintage and sustainable stylist and cofounder of Open for Vintage. ""The reason why brands are launching these spaces is because your average consumer now wants to find something unique and one-off but doesn't have time to go to a fair."" Instead, these easy-to-navigate, hyper-curated vintage offerings are likely to resonate with those first-hand luxury shoppers for whom second-hand is becoming a virtue-signalling flex. ""For a consumer of luxury brands, popping a new outfit all the time is not necessarily as aspirational [as it was before],"" says fashion trend forecaster Geraldine Wharry, mentioning how celebrities are starting to recycle their outfits on the red carpet. ""There is a movement around pointing that out and putting it out as a model behaviour."" More generally, these initiatives tap into a change in the way that consumers, especially younger ones, build their wardrobes. ""Consumers are more and more interested in investing in pieces emotionally as something that they want to keep for a very long time,"" says Stavros Karelis, founder of Londonbased concept store Machine-A. ""Whether it belongs to the vintage world or to young designers is less and less relevant, it's more about a unique offering and having an emotional connection."" Last week, Machine-A formed a partnership with vintage brand Byronesque to launch Machine-B, a retail concept that breaks the barrier between vintage and contemporary by fully integrating an edit of archive pieces from the latter, including brands such as Rick Owens, Maison Martin Margiela and Raf Simons, with Machine-A's current-season offering on the shop floor. Joy Montgomery, a shopping editor who is in charge of the Secondhand Shopper franchise, says that ""offering these pieces alongside the main collection puts them on an equal footing [and contributes to] the idea of second-hand as an open and viable alternative, not more faff for the shopper."""

The heir to the British throne was in Glasgow to bestow some royal favour on businesses he saw leading that change companies as diverse as AstraZeneca, Bank of America, IBM and L'Oréal. His patronage came in the form of the Terra Carta Seal, an award created by former Apple designer Sir Jony Ive that features oak leaves, honey bees and a butterfly. The party at which Prince Charles mingled with chief executives captured a congratulatory mood at COP26 among some of the world's largest businesses, many of which have used the summit to advertise fresh sustainability initiatives. But the regal validation was paired with a harsher critique from others at the summit that many companies' emissions-cutting plans do not oblige them to change their behaviour any time soon or hold senior executives accountable for realising them. Some companies, the critics charge, are also engaged in hypocritical lobbying that is undermining the climate action they claim to want to see. For growing numbers of environmental activists, regulators and multilateral organisations, the voluntary steps companies have taken so far have had nowhere near the impact needed to steer humanity's course away from climate catastrophe. Indeed, some in Glasgow argued, the focus on voluntary corporate action risks weakening the drive for badly needed government policy interventions. Such concerns are driving pressure for the next chapter of the corporate response to climate change to be marked by fewer parties and press releases and by more verifiable standards, mandatory reporting and meaningful carbon prices. ""Their main goal at COP is to emerge as undisrupted as possible,"" Pat Brown, founder of the alternative protein start-up Impossible Foods, says of the business and political elites gathered in Glasgow. Instead, he warned, ""what is needed is radical change and fast"". Embracing net zero Companies are not formally part of the Conference of the Parties meetings, which are reunions of countries that signed the 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. But this year's summit was swarming with executives and their consultants, crowding out campaigners and even national delegates from Glasgow's overfull hotels. The corporate crowd jetted in with a self-assured message for politicians: that business has been leading the way on climate action and it is high time that governments catch up. The International Chamber of Commerce told governments to ""wake up"" to the risk that their patchwork carbon pricing regimes could slow progress on emissions cuts.    The US Business Roundtable and its counterparts in Europe, Australia, Canada and Mexico told world leaders that companies could not ""shoulder the burden alone"" of investing in new clean technologies. Companies were now the ones asking for more ambitious climate action and saying ""for God's sake, do something about it"", Francesco Starace, chief executive of Enel, told Fortune. The message from some politicians at COP26 was not much different. ""It's bankers that are now deciding. You have major corporate America factoring in the price of carbon. It matters,"" US president Joe Biden said. In the years after Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, US companies embraced the idea that they were filling a void left by Washington by voluntarily setting ""net zero"" targets to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, or offset any they could not eliminate. The Business Roundtable, for example, argued recently that the country had made significant progress towards reducing emissions ""in part because of corporate leadership in the absence of a smart, national climate policy"". Corporate America is far from unique in this, however. A recent survey of global chief executives by Accenture and the UN Global Compact found that just 18 per cent believe governments have given them the clarity they need to set goals in line with a 1.5C trajectory. While some global business leaders are embracing the opportunity to help drive the new economic agenda, others like Joachim Wenning, chief executive of reinsurance giant Munich Re, feel a growing sense of unease. ""Very often I've heard things like 'in the absence of governments doing their job ... we the private sector, we the economic leaders, have to take care of combating climate change'. It's almost: 'Then we have to replace the governments',"" Wenning says. ""I think it's an illusion. It's not only that we don't have the mandate. We don't have the means."" Empty pledges The flood of pledges before and during COP26 suggests that the pace of corporate climate action is accelerating. One in three of the largest public companies in G20 countries now has a net zero target, up from one in five last year, according to an international research initiative called the Net Zero Tracker. In the UK, nearly half of the members of the FTSE 100 have set net zero goals, while mentions of net zero in corporate reports have increased by 370 per cent in two years, according to Datamaran, an ESG analytics company. Behind the marketing materials, though, some of those pledges are less promising than they seem. Just one in five of the G20-based companies that have set emissions-cutting goals have aligned them with keeping temperatures to within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels by 2050, according to the non-profit Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). According to a new MSCI report, companies' current emissions plans are still putting the globe on track for warming of 3C. That is alarming many of the people who believe most ardently in the central role companies can play in responding to climate change. ""We are very concerned about the credibility of all the targets out there,"" says Lila Karbassi, chief of programmes at the UN Global Compact, the UN's voluntary corporate sustainability network, which is a partner in SBTi. One problem is that many companies are pledging to hit those targets in almost three decades' time without committing to action for which they can be held accountable in the short term, says Austin Whitman, chief executive of Climate Neutral, a non-profit that helps brands cut their emissions. ""I think we are taking far too much comfort from the fact that companies are making these commitments for 2050,"" he says. ""There's a reality that if you're making a 2050 pledge you really don't have to change anything today."" Another source of friction and suspicion is that many corporate net zero plans foresee continuing to emit greenhouse gases while purchasing carbon offsets to compensate. Critics increasingly question the true benefits of the forestry projects on which most such credits are based. Through this unregulated market with wildly variable standards, some researchers warn, companies are able to claim carbon neutrality on paper while continuing to heat the planet in practice. ""A lot of private institutions want to direct money into carbon offsets and say that this is the answer to the climate crisis. Really, it's just an excuse to keep emitting,"" says Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a Manila-based activist and prominent member of Fridays for Future, a movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg.    Without hard standards or regulations currently governing the carbon market, says Impossible Foods' Brown, ""any scammer can create and sell carbon credits. It makes the value of that system approximately zero."" UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has warned about ""a deficit of credibility and a surplus of confusion over emissions reductions and net zero targets, with different meanings and different metrics"". A push for more meaningful standards for reporting climate action may be a harbinger of the more rigorous scrutiny companies can expect. After SBTi released a new voluntary standard for corporate net zero targets last month, which pushes companies to focus on decarbonisation rather than offsets, the UN Global Compact said yesterday that more than 600 companies had committed to abide by it. Even so, Karbassi says clearer rules would also be needed. ""We need fullspeed voluntary [action], full-speed regulation [and] more scrutiny around transparency,"" she says. ""I think it's going to become a societal expectation that you have a credible net zero standard, and it's going to be an expectation from investors."" A broader push to standardise how companies account for their social and environmental impact also looks likely to usher in an era of mandatory reporting that will leave the fight against climate change less reliant on companies opting to take the initiative. In the UK, companies will be required to report their climate risks from 2022, following guidelines from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. The IFRS Foundation's launch this month of an International Sustainability Standards Board is seen as the first step in bringing the rigour of mandatory financial reporting to previously voluntary and vague environmental and social impact disclosures. 'Green growth' vs carbon tax Companies overwhelmed with competing ESG initiatives have mostly welcomed such attempts at standardisation, while a group of investors with $4.5tn under management has said it plans to vote against the reappointment of auditors that do not ensure clients' climate pledges are credible. But the calls from business leaders at COP26 for more action from governments jar with the way many of them have greeted attempts to reduce emissions through regulation or taxation. ""They give passionate speeches then turn around and are either not investing much or are actively lobbying against"" what they claim to favour, says Climate Neutral's Whitman. Jussi Pesonen, chief executive of the Finnish paper company UPM, summed up the mood of many European executives this summer when he told analysts that he hoped policymakers would focus on ""green growth"" rather than ""regulation, limitation and taxation"". Industry groups pushed back on several parts of the European Commission's legislation for reducing emissions this summer, according to Influence Map, a London-based environmental group. Environmental activists have similarly accused the US Chamber of Commerce and other trade associations of undermining climate policies in Washington, including measures in the ""build back better"" bill Biden has championed, which business fears would be funded with higher corporate taxes. ""What you have heard at this COP from corporate America is very different than what we in Congress hear from corporate America through corporate trade associations,"" says Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator who joined the US delegation in Glasgow. ""The corporate members who made big promises here at this COP have got to get their trade associations under control so they're not undercutting our work in Congress,"" he warns. That work has also been undercut by a centrist Democrat from a state whose economy depends heavily on the coal industry. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator, has already opposed a programme in Biden's spending package which would pay utilities to transition away from fossil fuels. Despite groups including the US Business Roundtable calling on COP26 leaders to implement an ""effective and fair"" carbon pricing system, Manchin also says that a carbon price ""is not on the board"". But a serious carbon pricing system would be a uniquely powerful tool in building a low-carbon market economy, say business leaders such as Wenning of Munich Re. ""A sufficiently painful carbon price would trigger the market mechanisms that will indirectly transform the energy sector and the related industries,"" he says. ""I totally buy into it, and I wish for a higher carbon price."" Less bad may not be good enough As more companies make their environmental credentials central to how they present themselves to customers, employees and other    stakeholders, lobbying efforts that clash with their climate-friendly branding carry greater reputational risks than before. Now that the private sector has positioned itself as an environmental leader, even some early advocates of companies leading the fight against climate change are now warning about the risk of half measures. Explaining why a corporate social responsibility strategy that focuses on being less bad is not good enough, Paul Polman, the former Unilever chief executive, said last month: ""If you're a murderer and you killed 10 people, and now you're declaring that you're a better murderer by only killing five people, I don't think you'll get away with that."" Despite years of environmental promises, only a minority of people around the world trust business to do the right thing to address climate change, according to a recent poll by Edelman, the public relations agency. For Whitman at Climate Neutral, that scepticism reflects a mismatch between companies' rhetoric and the discouragingly limited impact most people have seen from their climate promises of recent years. ""I think we have to evaluate it in terms of outcomes and not inputs, and right now the inputs are a lot of pledges and the outcomes are emissions [that] are continuing to rise,"" he says. ""You can't want climate change to be solved but only on your terms."" 'A lot of private institutions want to direct money into carbon offsets ... Really, it's just an excuse to keep emitting' 'There's a reality that if you're making a 2050 pledge you really don't have to change anything today'"
b28f2648cb3e7bcd26f7,2021-11-10,Climate change best practice must be the norm across finance,"Letters Having read Gillian Tett's column (""Green transition may depend on auditors"", Opinion, November 5), it was good to see the decarbonisation commitments made by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Ambitious mid-century net zero and interim targets will not be met, however, without similar collective ambition to build the capacity, capabilities and culture of the banking and finance professions so every professional financial decision really does take climate change and broader sustainability into account. To pass the ""Carney Test"", it will not be sufficient simply to increase the number of environmental, social and governance, climate risk and sustainability specialists working in finance. Every professional working in and supporting finance must develop a knowledge of climate transition and sustainability and be able to apply this in the context of their role. What is currently seen as best practice in a few advanced institutions incorporating ESG and sustainability into investment and lending decisions must be standard practice across finance, establishing new norms and professional standards for the GFANZ era.

58fae4bbcd018588dc3b,2021-11-10,Bonds remain in an ESG blind spot for investors,"A strangely paradoxical feature of current markets is how global capital manages to be both supportive and subversive of the environmental, social and governance agenda that has been a central focus of investor attention around the COP26 climate change summit. Equity funds with socially responsible or ESG mandates have attracted twice as much money in the year to date as their counterparts without them, according to data provider EPFR. Yet this push for decarbonisation and social responsibility, which is as much an asset management marketing ploy as a token of virtue, is primarily an equity market phenomenon. In the much larger global bond market, BBVA Global Markets Research has estimated that in late 2020 the stock of green, social and sustainable bonds had yet to reach $1tn out of a market total of $128tn. While this green exposure is rising fast from a low base, it is indisputably minuscule. The majority of this market is ethically value free. ShareAction, a nonprofit responsible investment research group, found last year that 84 per cent of asset managers had no public policy against purchasing sovereign bonds from countries under international sanction for human rights abuses. One consequence of this in the fund management fraternity is that global capital is rewarding China, the world's biggest polluter and a country criticised over human rights. Despite increasing tension between Washington and Beijing, foreign direct investment in China is running at record levels, while inflows into onshore Chinese debt reached $186bn in 2020. Even after market jitters over regulatory risk arising from Beijing's ""common prosperity"" agenda and rising default risk in the real estate sector, foreign holdings of Chinese bonds jumped about 30 per cent in 2021 to more than Rmb3.9tn, according to central bank figures. For debt investors, the bait lies in the fact that the Chinese sovereign debt market has long been offering a significantly higher yield than the US Treasury market. With much lower inflation than in the US, real yields on Chinese government IOUs are also positive. So for global investors the search for yield trumps ESG considerations. At the same time, the progressive inclusion of Chinese bonds into the big global indices ensures that passive fund managers which track them continue to pour yet more money into China. The ESG sensitivity of the global bond market is nonetheless set to increase because the advanced country central banks are committing to greening the portfolios of bonds they have acquired through their asset purchasing programmes. China's foreign exchange regulator's numbers show that central banks account for $264bn of the outstanding $512bn balance of foreign-held Chinese debt. The Chinese government debt market is relatively illiquid as the commercial banks that are the chief participants in the market buy and hold to maturity. So rising central bank exposure to it reflects a growing tendency to prioritise diversification and the search for yield over liquidity and security. It also suggests that central banks such as the European Central Bank and those eurosystem central banks that hold renminbi-denominated assets may be caught in an internal green-brown carbon conflict. Policymakers at COP26 have been looking to asset managers and owners to do much of the work on decarbonisation, both in terms of financing the overhaul of the carbon intensive capital stock and pressuring    companies to aim for net zero emissions. Yet there is a limit to what they can do given that many big emitters are state owned or private and thus not much beholden to institutional investors. In addition, fund manager Black- Rock's chief executive Larry Fink has warned that pressure on public companies to pursue net zero targets while leaving private ones out of the spotlight provides an opportunity for ""the biggest capital markets arbitrage in my lifetime"". He has a point, though the transfer of dirty assets from public to private equity also entails the biggest regulatory risk on the planet. This is because the Paris and Glasgow objectives are unlikely to be achieved without more widespread use of carbon pricing which would severely impair the value of dirty assets. Yet private equity managers know that carbon pricing and tougher regulation of heavy emitters is politically fraught. So their absorption of quoted companies' carbon intensive assets may continue for a while yet. john.plender@ft.com While this green exposure is rising fast from a low base, it is indisputably minuscule"
f2d3c35b3480b695c80b,2021-11-10,Investors need good data to navigate ESG landscape,"Letters While it is positive to see so many financial institutions looking to offer sustainable investments to the market, a number of regulatory and data transparency issues need to be considered (""Regulators step up scrutiny of investment 'greenwashing'"", Report, November 9). The sourcing of high quality and veritable environmental, social and governance data is fundamental to ensuring firms unquestionably prove to investors the sustainability of their products and decisions. In order to do this, wealth and asset managers need to pull as much data from different sources, including alternative data sources, to create as full a picture as possible. This will in turn help to navigate the ESG landscape and enable firms to prove the long-term value of their investment decisions.

ca37ce7f9fb06df8e78c,2021-11-10,Investors get tougher on climate,"Some asset managers are tiring of quiet conversations with companies about their carbon emissions and are threatening to divest, a dramatic shift for the $110tn industry that has global implications. As Covid-19 ripped through the world in 2020, a cluster of senior figures at Aviva Investors, the £262bn UK asset manager, held a series of virtual meetings over the course of six months to discuss the other big issue looming over their portfolios: climate change. Concerned that global warming would hit the long-term valuations of companies, the group decided on a rare course of action for a big asset manager. Aviva Investors warned about 30 fossil fuel intensive companies that if they failed to take radical action to slash their emissions, it would sell out across its equities and fixed income portfolios within one to three years. It was a bold move that dramatised a growing dispute within the $110tn investment industry. Many big asset managers still routinely dismiss divestment, arguing it is better to stay invested and try to alter corporate behaviour through background conversations with companies. However, there are a growing number of large, traditional investors who are taking a tougher approach with companies over global warming, a change in attitude that could have huge ramifications for businesses around the world. Big investors including ABP, one of the world's largest pension funds, and Norway's oil fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, have announced divestment plans. At the same time, some of the investors who remain as shareholders are willing to adopt more confrontational tactics ? most notably, the successful campaign by an activist investor to join the board of ExxonMobil. The shift comes as the investors are under pressure from clients, regulators and the public to use their power as shareholders to police companies' climate change efforts. Colin Baines, investment engagement manager at Friends Provident Foundation, which lobbies for responsible investment, says that in order to cut emissions, many asset managers will have to rethink how they interact with companies. Mirza Baig, global head of environmental, social and governance investments at Aviva Investors, who was involved in the discussions, predicts that more asset managers will consider tools such as divestment as the industry comes under pressure to prove it is taking climate change seriously. ""An approach where you have perpetual engagement with no real change at a corporate level will be untenable,"" Baig suggests, adding that the current ""softer approach to engagement"" favoured by the investment industry is not delivering the results needed. The climate police This potential for a tougher approach comes as report after report suggests climate change could have a catastrophic impact on investment returns and the global economy if left unchecked. In August, a landmark report    by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said ""immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions"" in emissions were needed to avert a calamitous effect on the planet. Earlier this year, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, predicted a cumulative loss in economic output of nearly 25 per cent over the next two decades if no climate change mitigation measures were taken. Its research also forecasts big falls in returns for sectors such as energy and utilities. Investors argue they alone cannot change corporate behaviour, with a need for increased regulation and government policy to force businesses to tackle emissions. But there is a growing acceptance that the investment industry too must play a role in the transition to a low-carbon economy, especially as demand for ESG investing soars. A survey by NinetyOne, the UK-listed investment house, recently found that half of 6,000 individual investors polled across 10 countries believed asset managers should use their influence as shareholders to help drive a reduction in emissions in carbon-heavy companies. Asset managers are also increasingly expected to prove their eco-credentials in order to win new businesses or keep existing clients. In the UK, a group of foundations, university endowments and religious groups has rolled out minimum standards they expect asset managers to meet around climate change. Investment firms that fail to meet those standards risk being dumped. Then there is the threat of legal action. Before it announced divestment plans, ABP had faced the threat of legal action over its fossil fuel-related investments from workers whose pensions it oversees. Groups such as Climate Action 100+, a coalition of more than 600 investors with $55tn in assets, have also been established to push companies to change. Earlier this year, CA100+ said that 52 per cent of the companies it was targeting ? which account for about 80 per cent of global emissions ? had set net zero targets. ""What you can see with the CA100+ outcomes ... is that engagement can be impactful,"" says Carola van Lamoen, head of sustainable investing at Robeco, the Dutch asset manager. But the CA100+ data also reveals the extent to which ambitions often lack substance. Only around one quarter of companies had included their most material so-called Scope 3 emissions ? the emissions from their customers. Moira Birss, climate and finance director at Amazon Watch, the US environmental group, says thanks in part to ""toothless"" engagement from asset managers, many of the net zero commitments made by companies are ""extremely vague or do little to nothing to address the need to rapidly wind down fossil fuels"". ""We need to see way more action from the fund industry,"" she adds. This is backed up by research. A study by academics at Edhec Business School found that while institutional investors claim they are actively engaging with companies on climate issues, this is not followed by an actual decrease in the carbon footprint of those businesses. ""[Investors] are unlikely to play a major role in the low carbon transition unless their active ownership becomes more effective,"" the authors wrote. Ben Caldecott, director of the sustainable finance programme at the University of Oxford Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, says a problem with the current model of engagement used by the investment industry is that few asset managers have a long-term plan around how to interact with businesses over climate change. ""There has been very little playing chess like a chess champion, where [asset managers are] thinking several moves ahead and coming up with proper strategies,"" he says. ""Very few are thinking about all the levers they have available."" These levers include backing greener companies and projects, as well as tools such as divestment and shareholder activism, including filing resolutions at annual meetings, he says. The divestment movement traces its roots back to religious groups and foundations, which typically shunned stocks for ethical reasons. In recent years, swaths of university endowments, religious groups and foundations around the world have committed to divest from some fossil fuel intensive companies, but big asset managers and pension funds have been slower to react.    A report by Reclaim Finance, a nonprofit, this year found that fewer than half of the world's 29 biggest asset managers had a policy to limit coal investments, considered one of the most polluting fossil fuels, let alone other carbon-intensive industries. Many asset managers argue that divestment will not change behaviour. ""A lot of investors still feel that in order to influence a company you have to be invested in it,"" says Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, one of the groups behind CA100+. Others argue that by selling out too early on climate grounds, investors could miss out on strong returns over the next few years. In October the FT reported that hedge funds were swooping in to buy up the shares of unloved oil and gas companies, making big profits in the process. There are also concerns that the shares of the biggest polluters could end up in the hands of less diligent investors, who care little about the global ramifica- tions of climate change. ""I'm not convinced that divesting because of climate will solve the issue. There will be people willing to take those shares forever,"" says Sébastien Thévoux-Chabuel, a fund manager at Comgest, the French asset manager. Shareholder activism Many asset managers have also been reluctant to get behind shareholder activism around climate change, such as by voting for resolutions calling for companies to set climate transition plans. As recently as 2017, BlackRock regularly argued that it preferred discussing climate change privately with companies, rather than publicly voting for climate resolutions that boards were unsupportive of. Even now, few asset managers co-file resolutions around climate change at annual meetings. One sign that this could be starting to change is the activist campaign at Exxon undertaken by Engine No 1, a small hedge fund. Despite owning just 0.02 per cent of the shares, Engine No 1 managed to win over shareholders to support its efforts to overhaul the oil major's board, with a mandate to prepare it for a future free of fossil fuels. Al Gore, the former US vice-president and co-founder of sustainable asset manager Generation Investment Management, said the fact that Exxon was now reviewing its investments in hydrocarbons was a ""direct result"" of Engine No 1's campaign, describing the activist's success as ""thrilling"". But he added that these types of campaigns are ""not for the faint hearted"", requiring a lot of time, effort and money. The US hedge fund is estimated to have spent $12.5m on the battle at Exxon, as well as dedicating months to the campaign ? something few investors could afford to do with a single stock. Still others have been inspired by Engine No 1. ""We are looking at how we can work with other asset owners to do more [like this],"" says Bess Joffe, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which manage the CofE's investment fund and backed Engine No 1. ""We see a lot of potential for ... activist stewardship to play an increasing role."" Describing Engine No 1 as the ""little engine that could"", Joffe says companies need to wake up to the fact that they could be the next target of an effective shareholder climate campaign. ""If it can happen at Exxon it can happen to any of them. We will leverage that in future in conversations with other companies."" Tougher times for companies Cary Krosinsky, a lecturer at Yale and Brown universities, says that both selling out and activism have problems when they are conducted in isolation. ""[Divestment] is largely a waste of time,"" he says, while activism can be expensive. Yet he also argues that selling out of stocks might form part of a tougher approach that is based on a ""carrot on a stick"" effort. ""[What is] not useful is a 10-year [engagement] campaign that leads to little or no change,"" he says. If a period of engagement ends with no progress, deciding to ditch a company might make sense. ""That's not divestment, that's a sell discipline."" David Blood, who co-founded Generation with Gore, says that passive giants such BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors will have a harder time divesting. ""[They] don't have a choice until you change the index or you decide to get your clients' approval to deviate from the benchmark,"" he said. ""They have to ramp up their engagement efforts significantly."" But active managers must vote with their wallets, says Blood: ""You can have engagement for a while but unless you have a clear and present commitment to divest, your engagement isn't credible. I don't think you have decades to work with companies, I think you have a couple of years.""    Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, a charity that promotes responsible investment, says investors have an obligation to manage both financial and systemic risk, adding that ""high-quality shareholder activism"" or divestment can help in this process. ""If you just engage and there is never any sanction for the company, you'll never sell, then management will just continue on doing what they are doing,"" she says. ""I think we are going to see more divestment and bold activism in the next 12 months."" Even investors who are big advocates of engagement are increasingly weighing up divestment and increased activism. Earlier this year, Robeco rolled out a new climate engagement programme that included an option to divest. ""Exclusions are a means of last resort. We prefer engagement over exclusions,"" says Van Lamoen. ""[But] if there is a lack of commitment, then we could opt for divestment."" New York State Common Retirement Fund, one of the US's biggest public pension plans, is doing something similar. It has dumped 22 coal stocks after a long assessment process and is currently reviewing its investments in shale oil and gas companies. The Church of England too is ditching stocks over climate concerns, even if Joffe says she believes that ""having a seat at the table"" is generally more effective. Last year, the church's two investment bodies restricted investments in companies including Berkshire Hathaway and Korea Electric Power Corp over climate change concerns. Joffe says a tougher approach, involving activism and divestment, ""will have to become more mainstream"", especially if asset managers and asset owners are to meet their net zero commitments. For companies, this means a tougher time from shareholders, says Tom Matthews, a partner who specialises in corporate activism at White and Case. He adds the ""narrative around climate change has shifted significantly versus where it was in 2015"", when the Paris agreement was signed. ""We're seeing companies getting targeted because they haven't woken up quickly enough."" As for Aviva Investors, Baig says he believes the UK asset manager will end up selling out of at least some of the companies it is targeting because they are not making progress quickly enough. ""We have to be bold enough to walk way,"" he says. 'If you just engage and there is never any sanction for the company, [managers] will just continue on doing what they are doing' 'I'm not convinced that divesting because of climate will solve the issue. There will be people willing to take those shares forever'"
b4e15599de7dcf6f9cbe,2021-11-09,Baillie Gifford boss should reconsider China strategy,"Letters In his interview with the FT, Baillie Gifford's James Anderson (Report, November 6) doubled down on the importance of deepening western investment in China. However, he fails to properly account for the risks both to the investor bottom line and the firm's reputation as a leader in environmental, social and governance investing. From the crackdown in Hong Kong to the treatment of Jack Ma, politics always trumps economics in China. The latest crackdown on private businesses is a strategic move before the March 2022 National People's Congress, where Xi Jinping is expected to be confirmed as lifetime chairman. Baillie Gifford's analysts may be good at finding alpha, but how many understand the drivers of Communist party politics in Zhongnanhai? The way they were blindsided by the crackdown on the education sector raises questions about whether investor funds are really safe in their hands. It was also striking that there was nothing in his remarks about ESG. As Dame Helena Morrissey pointed out a couple of weeks ago, Baillie Gifford's deep investment in China is ""hard to reconcile"" with the firm's commitment in their governance and sustainability guidelines that they expect all the firms they invest in to comply with the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. How do their ties with firms such as BGI Genomics or Chinese tech firms that helped to develop the Xinjiang surveillance state square with this? Before doubling down on China, perhaps Anderson should consider this.

c93b32f65743acce53c2,2021-11-08,Investing in energy is the way to get to net zero,"Letters In ""Third Point blasts Shell's efforts to walk the green tightrope"" (Opinion, November 4) Brooke Masters has delivered the critical messages we will need if we are to have the best chance of achieving global net zero targets. Third Point and other activists argue for the break-up of integrated energy companies into their legacy fuel and chemicals businesses, and so-called ""green arm"" operations focused on the future. Masters notes that at the same time enthusiasm for investment funds that exclude fossil fuel companies, and others that do poorly on environmental, social and governance criteria, appears to have peaked. While this may seem alarming, it hopefully serves as a wake-up call that will lead to serious discussions about how today's ESG metrics and guidance are performing. It is said that every choice has a consequence. Recently, we have been witnessing the effect of choices, which are less than well thought out. Reductions in energy investment and implementation of regulations that restrict access to oil and natural gas resources are outpacing the gradual advance of renewable fuels and other energy-related technologies. It is the reason we are now seeing energy supply shortfalls and higher prices across the globe. It may seem counterintuitive, but it is actually in our interest to support today's energy demands with our available resources. Making the choice today to apply balanced, flexible, and aligned approaches to ESG principles can ensure that energy companies continue to attract necessary investment and obtain necessary financing that will allow us to build a bridge from fossil fuels to the net zero models of the future.

66ea5b65a4e261794378,2021-11-08,Allbirds drops claim of first 'sustainable' IPO,"Personal & household goods Allbirds, the footwear brand that listed on Nasdaq last week, has dropped its claim to be the first ""sustainable"" initial public offering after the Securities and Exchange Commission objected, according to the company's chief financial officer. The San Francisco-based business's plans were an example of a recent trend among companies to emphasise their ethical credentials ahead of listing. But the move by the SEC highlights how regulators are paying increasing attention to how companies report on climateand sustainability-related issues. Allbirds announced in August that it would pursue a ""sustainable public equity offering"" that would guarantee the company met various environmental, sustainability and governance standards. However, it repeatedly weakened the proposals in subsequent updates to its IPO prospectus. In September, it removed references to a sustainable ""offering"" and said it would instead follow a ""sustainability principles and objectives"" framework. In October, it then removed half the references to the new framework, including suggestions that it could increase the cost of the IPO and that other companies could follow its ""sustainable"" approach. Mike Bufano, Allbirds' chief financial officer, said the company's commitment to sustainability remained but he added that it had been pushed by regulators to change its prospectus. He declined to give details. ""There's lots of stuff that changes because you get feedback from different stakeholders, in this case the SEC, but ... we believe [the framework] is still really useful for other companies,"" Bufano said. The SEC declined to comment. The commission has renewed its focus on climate change disclosures and nomenclature this year. In March, it requested public comments on disclosure rules ""with an eye toward facilitating the disclosure of consistent, comparable and reliable information on climate change"". Gary Gensler, SEC chair, last month told a congressional hearing that the commission was also eyeing investment funds' labels to ensure there is sufficient ""rigour"" behind sustainability claims. Companies in the US will also find it harder to obstruct climate change and human rights petitions from annual shareholder votes following reforms announced last Wednesday. Repealing the shareholder measures, which were adopted during the Trump administration, was a win for environmentalists and other socially aware investors who file resolutions to push companies to reform their business practices. Bufano said existing ESG rating systems ""are great but are biased to companies with longer track records""."
e5d20365079809b34ccb,2021-11-08,New Statesman embarks on global mission,"Media. Expansion plans Current affairs magazine seeks to capitalise on growing foreign interest in UK politics Founded by the socialist Fabian Society and long considered the in-house journal of Britain's Labour party, the New Statesman magazine is embarking on what its editor describes as the biggest expansion in its 108-year history, bankrolled by a data industry entrepreneur. The editor, Jason Cowley, has set his sights on engaging an overseas readership, with a focus on the US, Germany and France, in an attempt to triple its readership to 100,000 and emulate the international success of other UK-based publications such as The Economist. ""The UK has suddenly become quite interesting,"" Cowley said. ""Because of Brexit, because of Boris Johnson, because of the potential break up of the UK. The crisis of the British constitution is a big subject. We find these are subjects that an international audience wants to read about. ""We have convinced the owner that we are a title worthy of investment,"" he added, referring to Mike Danson, founder of the London-listed market research company GlobalData. ""We have an investment plan."" Other current affairs titles are also growing their readership, bucking a long-term decline in the wider magazine sector that has forced some publications to abandon print. The total number of print magazines sold dropped 55 per cent between 2010 and 2019 to 660m, according to research company Enders Analysis. The pandemic has accelerated the decline and circulation fell to 513m last year. In contrast, sales of The Spectator, the New Statesman's rightof-centre rival, are higher than ever. In the US, readership of The Atlantic rose 24 per cent year on year in the first six months of 2021, according to the Alliance for Audited Media, compared with an 18.4 per cent overall decline for magazines. ""We're all bombarded with informa- tion, and a weekly digest just seems to make an awful lot of sense,"" said Douglas McCabe, chief executive of Enders Analysis. ""This is a very resilient sector,"" he added, drawing a comparison with other genres that ""are all but disappearing"", such as celebrity gossip and men's interest. Since he became editor in 2008, Cowley has brought in fresh voices, published longer essays and sought to make the New Statesman more politically ""unpredictable' by loosening its ties with Labour. The title introduced a digital paywall two years ago, and the website was recently relaunched, along ca di lo ti T du pa ag w re w tit with a redesigned print title. After decades of dwinm dling circulation and under-investment, the strategy has started to bear fruit: total paid-for readership has risen from less than 20,000 when Cowley took over to 36,000. About 17,000 of these are print only, with the remainder either digital only or print and digital bundles.    Perhaps surprisingly for a title whose traditional mainstay is British politics, about a third of the New Statesman's online readers are in North America. ""The ideas and the areas we're interested in ? ESG [environmental, social and corporate governance], global economy, crisis of liberalism ? we think there's a big market for us beyond the UK,"" said Cowley. Among the positions he is looking to fill are a Brussels bureau chief, an Asia editor and a writer on China. An enlarged editorial budget is being provided by Danson, who took a 50 per cent stake in 2008 after he netted £165m from the sale of his Datamonitor business to Informa. The following year he bought the remainder from Geoffrey Robinson, former paymaster general in Tony Blair's government. His other media interests span the luxury lifestyle title Spears and the Press Gazette trade magazine, as well as a majority stake in GlobalData, whose market capitalisation has swelled to £1.6bn. But he keeps a low profile. ""He wants to run it [the New Statesman] as a business: it's not a vanity project,"" said a person close to Danson, who described his politics as ""middle of the road"". Danson's deep pockets have already financed a hiring spree at the New Statesman, adding about 16 journalists to the now 45-strong team in the past year. ""I feel like a soccer coach with a transfer budget for the first time,"" Cowley said. ""Rather than retrenching during the Covid recession, Mike invested."" The publication is moving to a new office in Hatton Garden, London's jewellery quarter, in the new year. Formed in 1913 with the stated aim of ""permeating the educated and influential classes with socialist ideas"", the magazine, much like the Labour party, has a decidedly less ideologically strident tone under its current editor. ""There were certain perceptions about the New Statesman: it was seen as a mouthpiece for the Labour party, or a rainbow coalition of disaffected leftwing voices. That didn't interest me: the journalism I admire is sceptical, open minded, high quality,"" Cowley said. The journal was highly critical of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whom Cowley described in print as resembling ""a late-Seventies, red-brick university sociology lecturer"", although he now acknowledges that the title ""misread"" his rise to the leadership. It has also been sceptical of Corbyn's successor, Sir Keir Starmer, running a special issue on Labour's ""crisis"" after the disappointing local election results this year. ""I know Starmer found it very painful,"" Cowley said of the edition. Is he even a Labour party supporter? ""Personally? Not at the moment."" He added that he still regards the publication as being ""of"" the left. Yet it all arguably sounds rather far from the Fabians' ideals. Will they not be turning in their graves? ""No. The Fabians would be delighted. We're still interested in the interventionist state and the good that government can do. That's true to the original Fabian mission. And we're as committed to quality as they were."" 'The ideas and the areas we're interested in ... we think there's a big market for us beyond the UK'"
a35ab006550d365924e1,2021-11-06,BNY Mellon severs ties with Adani's Australia coal project,"Mining BNY Mellon has cut ties with one of the world's most controversial coal mines, after Financial Times reporting revealed its Australian subsidiary was preparing to finance the Carmichael project in Queensland. The US investment bank issued a statement yesterday saying it had reviewed its relationship with Adani Group, the Indian conglomerate that is developing the Carmichael mine, and had ""decided to resign from all legacy transactions with Adani in Australia"". The bank added it would not pursue future transactions with Adani in Australia. Adani has struggled to attract funding from banks for the Carmichael mine, which is expected to produce about 10m tonnes of coal a year and has sparked protests around the world. An FT investigation into bank financing of fossil fuel projects this week revealed that BNY's Australian subsidiary, BTA Institutional Services, was preparing to work with Adani on the Carmichael project. At the same time, the bank was in talks to join former Bank of England governor Mark Carney's net zero climate initiative, which was heavily promoted at this week's COP26 climate talks in Glasgow. Emails and documents seen by the FT describe BTA as the ""financier"" on the project and ""the party lending money to Adani"". BNY responded that while contracts had been prepared citing BTA's involvement, they were not signed. It also said it was not funding the project but it did provide ""administrative services"" to Adani in Australia, including acting as a security trustee. ""BNY Mellon has determined this business is not aligned with our ESG principles,"" the bank said in a statement announcing its decision to cut ties. The bank added that it would continue to honour its contractual obligations while the transactions were unwound and until its role was terminated. It did not disclose what other services it offered to Adani outside Australia."

10e25da12f043e8c72be,2021-11-04,Third Point blasts Shell's efforts to walk the green tightrope,"T rust us to ride two horses at once, say the big western energy companies. We will drill enough oil and natural gas to keep the lights on while shovelling the profits into renewables and electric vehicle charging stations to save the planet at the same time. Shell, TotalEnergies and BP have all been touting more or less aggressive versions of this strategy for a while. Similar lines have also started to appear at ExxonMobil and Chevron amid pressure from climate activists. Now Third Point is calling them out. Last week, the activist hedge fund run by Dan Loeb took aim at Shell, arguing that it should break itself up into a legacy oil and chemicals business and a green arm focused firmly on the future. Legacy Shell would drill the oil it already has while handing most of its free cash back to investors. Future Shell wouldn't be entirely green: it would use the existing natural gasfields to fund investment in renewables and its service stations. ""You can't be all things to all people,"" is how Third Point puts it. It argues that future Shell would attract growth-oriented investors who value environmental, social and governance factors, while legacy Shell would be optimised for those who value steady streams of cash. The climate would gain because total new investment in fossil fuel would fall. It is easy to see the attraction of Third Point's argument. Lumbering oil companies are not ideal hotbeds of green innovation and they have been linked to decades of climate misinformation. They are also clearly more comfortable with drilling than renewables: Shell's 2021 capital expenditure strategy called for putting $2bn-$3bn into renewables and $12bn in oil and gas. Royal Bank of Canada analysts estimate that Shell's parts could be worth $250bn, well above its current market capitalisation of $178bn. And five months after Anglo American tried a similar trick by spinning out its South African thermal coal assets, shares in the new company have doubled. No wonder opinions are split. Just last week ABP, the huge Dutch pension fund, said it was dumping €15bn in fossil fuel holdings, including Shell, because it no longer saw the point of working with such companies on decarbonisation. But Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman warned that failure to invest in oil and gas would lead to social unrest. Shell counters that there are significant synergies among its various businesses and that keeping them together allows it to help its 30m daily retail customers and 1m corporate customers decarbonise. ""These are complete, new value chains that need to be created,"" Jessica Uhl, Shell's chief financial officer, said last week. ""We can leverage the assets ... and the people that we have, and the understanding of the energy system."" Many investors seem to be coming around to this point of view. Enthusiasm for funds that exclude fossil fuel companies and others that do poorly on ESG criteria appears to have peaked. Assets, which topped $19tn in 2018, dropped back to $15tn last year, Bernstein analysts calculated. Instead, money is flooding into funds that engage with companies or integrate ESG criteria into their financial analysis: combined assets under management hit $35.7tn last year.    More than any other oil chief, BP's Bernard Looney is trying to catch this wave. He has boldly promised the company would cut oil and gas production by 40 per cent by 2030 while boosting renewables generation 20-fold. Yet BP has devoted just 16 per cent of its $9.2bn in 2021 capital expenditure to low carbon, compared with 39 per cent for oil and 24 per cent for gas. Gas arguably makes sense as a transition fuel to help wean the world off even dirtier coal, but the company is still devoting more than half of its long-term investment to fossil fuels. Adding to the disconnect, BP said on Tuesday that it planned to use the extra profits it had gained from rising energy prices to buy back $1.25bn more of its shares. That's on top of boosting the company's dividend and repurchasing $1.4bn in shares last quarter. Before excoriating Looney for failing to live up to his green rhetoric, it is worth remembering why he feels the need to keep investors sweet. Shortly after he unveiled his transition plans last year, the share price fell to a 25-year low, and it continues to lag behind the other oil majors. He remains convinced the plan is the right one, and returning cash to investors gives them a reason to stick around while he shows that BP can execute it. The company calls this ""performing while transforming. Our job is to do less talking and more delivering,"" Looney says. ""We've just got to keep at it."" brooke.masters@ft.com Lumbering oil companies are not ideal hotbeds of environmental innovation"
d04943d439f2ac3263b6,2021-11-04,Coal miners exploit rich seam in energy crisis,"The fossil fuel might be out of favour and on ESG blacklists but a small group of businesses is reaping huge rewards Thungela Resources had a baptism of fire in June when it was demerged from FTSE 100 miner Anglo American, with its share price sinking as much as 25 per cent on its trading debut in what had been billed a test of investor appetite in coal stocks. But since then surging coal prices have helped the Johannesburg-based company thrive its shares rose more than 300 per cent before retreating in the past month and it now commands a market value of $550m. ""The conventional wisdom was this thing will get dumped and that no one is going to buy it,"" said July Ndlovu, chief executive. ""What people forgot is that market fundamentals for thermal coal were still solid and ultimately that is exactly what has played out."" Thungela is among a small group of miners emerging as big winners from the global energy crunch that has pushed the price of thermal coal, which is burnt in power stations to generate electricity, to record levels. Others include Glencore, the biggest exporter of thermal coal, Peabody Energy, Whitehaven Coal and Exxaro Resources. They are set to generate large profits for shareholders this year and could continue to churn out cash for years to come as Asian demand for the polluting fossil fuel persists and banks refuse to finance new coal mines. ""The tendering activity we're seeing from customers at the moment is very strong,"" said Paul Flynn, Whitehaven chief executive. ""I think it points to robust settings from the supplydemand perspective for the next couple of years."" He expects the Sydney-listed company to swing to a net cash position in the first half of next year. Coal prices have leapt. High-energy Australia coal, a benchmark for the vast Asian market that started the year at $80 a tonne, surged to $250 before falling back to about $150. A combination of factors has played into the extraordinary surge, from supply disruptions in South Africa and Indonesia, two important producers, to rebounding electricity demand in China and utility companies in north-east Asia and Europe switching to coal in the face of spiralling gas prices. But more broadly the advance is underpinned by supply that is increasingly inelastic because of mine closures and banks refusing to bankroll new projects. ""There is no new investment going into thermal coal supply. From my standpoint the ... fundamentals suggest that we will see a tightening of supply over the next decade, maybe decade and a half,"" said Ndlovu. Demand remains robust for coal, a reliable source of baseload power for electricity grids, especially in Asia where huge numbers of people are still living in energy poverty. The International Energy Agency has estimated that there are 140GW of new coal plants globally under construction, and the G20 leaders stopped short of agreeing to end the use of coal in their own countries ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. For investors able to own coal producers, the next year promises bumper profits and returns.    Analysts at JPMorgan estimate Glencore's coal division could report a record $8.3bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2022 when production will increase to more than 120m tonnes and the full impact of this year's price surge will flow through to earnings. This could pave the way for large cash returns to shareholders. Glencore is also set to make a healthy return on a $588m deal to buy out its partners Anglo American and BHP in Cerrejón, a Colombian coal mine. Because of the way the deal was structured, Glencore will receive all the cash generated by the mine in 2021 and until the deal closes this year or next. ""On my numbers, Cerrejón will generate $1.2bn to June 2022, or $650m to December 31 this year, so even if it closes early it's a negative cost,"" said Tony Robson of Global Mining Research. Liberum, the broker, reckons Thungela will generate more than $400m of free cash flow next year, almost threequarters of its market value. ""Given what's happened with energy networks across the world over the past three months ... Thungela is still incredibly cheap,"" said Ben Davis, analyst. Although coal producers' share prices have risen sharply, they have barely kept pace with earnings growth. As such they remain lowly valued and analysts reckon a re-rating will prove elusive. ""Many funds cannot buy these shares due to environmental, social and governance concerns and some won't buy due to the risk that thermal coal is in a long-term structural decline,"" said Christopher LaFemina, analyst at Jefferies. Peabody Energy is trading on a forward price/earnings ratio of 2, according to LaFemina. He reckons the company, where earnings surged 200 per cent year on year in the third quarter, could in theory use its free cash flow to go private. Looking ahead, the big question for producers and investors is how long the boom lasts and what they should do with the huge profits they are generating. Some traders reckon prices have peaked and while they could remain elevated throughout the northern hemisphere winter and heating season in China, they are likely to fall sharply. Industry executives, however, are more optimistic even though China has ordered its miners to go all out to lift production and bring an end to power rationing. This has already seen thermal coal futures traded on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange fall sharply. Nombasa Tsengwa, incoming chief executive of Exxaro, the South African coal producer, expects prices to remain steady for the rest of the year and into 2022. ""Strong thermal coal demand from the northern hemisphere, rising gas prices along with the slow recovery of both seaborne and China domestic supply will support the seaborne price,"" she said. Exxaro is also looking to grow in commodities that will ""support a low-carbon future"", said Tsengwa. ""We have an ambitious target to become a diversified player and for our new Exxaro Minerals business to represent 50 per cent of expected coal ebitda within 10 years. We will achieve this by targeting acquisitions in three strategic minerals manganese, copper, bauxite."" Jim Grech, Peabody's chief executive, says the US miner will use excess cash to pay down debt, expand and decarbonise its existing assets and look at mergers and acquisitions. ""I think consolidation needs to occur,"" he told analysts and investors last week. ""The industry in general is a lot healthier ... but the availability of capital is still a challenge for anyone in the coal segment."" Glencore has also made its strategy clear. The Swiss-based company plans to run down its coal business and close all its mines within 30 years. In the meantime, it will use some of the cash generated from coal to expand its significant production of battery metals, including copper, cobalt and nickel. The rest it will ""kick back"" to shareholders. ""We will continue to run down our production as per our climate commitment,"" Gary Nagle, chief executive, told investors in August.    At Thungela, Ndlovu says the company will use bumper profits to reward shareholders ""who have come with us"" and also extend the life of its seven collieries in South Africa so it can manage its eventual closure liabilities, which Boatman Capital, a short seller, says have been massively understated. ""We have had some very interesting support from overseas investors ... who understand the fundamentals of coal and realise that while the [energy] transition is going to happen it's not going to happen as quickly as everyone in the western world is shouting that it will be,"" he said.

cb37b66e3c5d87858735,2021-11-04,City struggles to achieve green finance hub status,"erhaps it pays to be realistic. POnce, the City of London was the global financial capital. Then it was merely Europe's financial capital. When it could no longer be that because of Brexit, the government wanted it to be the green finance capital. Yesterday, the UK instead settled for the title of ""world's first net zero aligned financial centre"". The diminishing ambition reflects the challenge facing the City in becoming a world-beating centre for green finance. Green finance does offer a genuine opportunity. London can no longer serve as the gateway into European markets that it once was. The compa-nies listed on its stock exchange cannot compete with their megacap counterparts in New York. Its capital markets cannot offer start-ups the valuations they would earn in the US. The City needs a new pitch to global markets. But part of the problem with green finance is that no one knows what it means. They can't measure it, or invest in it. Suspicions of greenwashing are rife and reasonable. A cynical country could claim to be a green finance capital or even a net zero financial centre without that saying very much. The way to counteract such criticism is with robust rules and credible enforcement. This is not an area where less regulation is better. Fund managers want green assets to invest in. They need rules to determine what those are. The good news is the UK is making progress. There was a flurry of announcements to coincide with COP26 finance day. Less than two weeks ago, the government published its ""road map to sustainable investing"", which will help define what counts as green. Yesterday, the Financial Conduct Authority traversed further along that road with a discussion paper tackling when asset managers will be able to label products as sustainable. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, meanwhile committed the UK to ""move towards"" forcing banks, asset managers and listed companies to publish socalled transition plans setting out how they will decarbonise. The government is setting up a task force of serious climate finance groups and scientists to set gold standards and avoid greenwashing. Provided the government does indeed ""move"", this should give investors some much-desired clarity on climate issues and greater power to hold groups to account. The bad news is that while the UK was faffing about with negotiating fishing rights, the EU has stolen a march. Brussels has been faster at setting sustainability disclosure standards and better at attracting green investment. And unlike the UK, it hosts large, pure-play renewables companies such as Orsted and Vestas on its national stock markets. Since 2007, $423bn of green bonds have been issued in euros, according to Climate Bonds Initiative data. The sterling equivalent is $46bn, and $32bn of that has been this year. While the UK dithered about issuing green gilts, France, Germany and others got there first. Though the UK claimed the mantle of the largest sovereign bond issuance in September, it was overtaken by the EU a month later. Morningstar's Sustainability Atlas puts the UK stock exchange 15th out of 48 among ""sustainability leaders"". Amsterdam scores highest.    A report by think-tank New Financial last month showed the UK was behind the EU in most sectors of ESG financial activity, including in ESG bond issuance and specialist investment funds. ""In these sectors, ESG penetration in the UK is roughly four to five years behind the EU,"" New Financial concluded. The City still has time to catch up. Overall, the green finance industry is small even if asset managers claim ever-larger sums invested in a manner consistent with ESG aims. That means it would not take that much to pull ahead. London has a big pool of financial expertise and deep capital markets. It also has large legacy companies that need to decarbonise in the form of oil and gas giants and mining groups. If government and the financial sector get their act together, the City could yet secure a meaningful title of green finance capital and once again have something to celebrate. cat.rutterpooley@ft.com Part of the problem with green finance is no one knows what it means. They can't measure or invest in it"
3ae76294e04f7a6c88c5,2021-11-01,Companies must deliver better environmental disclosure,"We are at a watershed moment for corporate environmental disclosure. Global support for mandatory disclosure regulation has accelerated in the past year, with a wave of new rules being heralded from Brazil to Japan directly shaping how companies measure and manage their environmental impacts. It's a welcome move that will drive accountability and presents a huge opportunity to accelerate the transformation of capital markets towards becoming sustainable. However, there is a risk that regulation will not go far enough to tackle the scale of the crisis we face. With more countries including the UK set to make regulatory announcements in the run-up to and during COP26, we must consider the scope and impact of that regulation. The current focus on climate-related financial and risk-based data is an important first step. But, if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, we need a clear understanding of the effects of corporate activities on both people and the planet. Regulation should adopt this approach, which is increasingly referred to as double materiality. Some regions and countries are making significant moves towards what we at CDP call ""high quality mandatory disclosure"". These include the EU, with its proposal for a corporate sustainability reporting directive, and more recently Switzerland. But, as the corridor towards avoiding a breach of a 1.5C increase narrows, it is critical that other nations follow suit fast. For regulation to have the necessary impact, forward-looking information and temperature trajectories must be incorporated alongside risks, to capture the overall potential for long-term climate performance. Companies should be required to develop and disclose climate transition plans. These should include short-, medium- and long-term targets to ensure a response to climate change with the necessary urgency and scale. Interim five-year targets are critical they allow for transition plans that can be delivered without kicking the can down the road and raising more risk. These plans must include robust, quantitative and accredited sciencebased targets outlining how companies will transition to the 1.5C-aligned business model. Companies with science-based targets in place have typically cut emissions by 6.4 per cent per year according to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), well above the average rate of 4.2 per cent needed for 1.5C alignment. This type of innovation can redefine companies' bottom lines by creating new business models and sources of value, and by disrupting currently unsustainable economic systems. Regulation must address environment-related financial disclosure, as well as effects on people and the planet. The recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) have been instrumental in forming the basis of the current wave of regulation. But their focus on climate must be built upon. Risks are not only limited to climate change around half of global gross domestic product ($44tn) is highly or moderately dependent on nature. Science has told us that we cannot solve climate change without tackling environmental challenges, such as water security, deforestation and biodiversity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report, we cannot limit warming to 1.5C without this holistic approach. Regulation should require companies to disclose these impacts. It is also in the interest of companies, by affording them a better understanding of their impacts and dependencies on the natural world.    We have so much further to go in reaching our global environmental goals and corporate action is essential. Regulation should not create a ceiling or serve as a ""tick-box"" exercise. Instead, it must be the floor: a minimum requirement that stimulates even more ambitious, broader, and deeper disclosure and action. And now is the time for companies to act and get ahead of that regulation. I urge every company to prepare to ride the incoming wave of mandatory reporting and ensure that high-quality disclosure is at the heart of its strategy. Mandatory environmental disclosure was a distant goal in the minds of those of us who were involved in developing ESG reporting more than 20 years ago. So I am proud of the progress CDP's global disclosure system has made over the past 20 years. It has led, evolved, and adapted to these developments and ensured that companies responding to our requests are already prepared for current and future mandatory disclosure regimes. We will continue to innovate and adopt the latest standards to ensure they are implemented at scale globally, paving the way for further regulation. Companies can play a massive role in accelerating the transition to a net zero economy and are leading the way in many ways. This year, more than 13,000 companies accounting for over 64 per cent of global market capitalisation disclosed through CDP, showing governments that they are ready for more ambitious disclosure. And what if you are a company not yet disclosing? You must face governments, investors and market participants, which are asking for more. Now is the time to act. The writer is the chief executive of CDP, a charity that runs the global disclosure system for organisations seeking to manage their environmental impacts Regulation should not create a ceiling or serve as a 'tick-box' exercise instead, it must be the floor"
8081665abd9aac346452,2021-11-01,Obstacles remain on pathway to global sustainability standards,"Sustainable investment these days, everyone in financial markets talks about it. But not all agree on what it means. Plenty of sustainability consultants stand ready to offer their services, yet investors and companies need more clarity: they want agreed standards for investments that depend on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Shareholders also need more information on the financial impact of sustainable practices on their holdings. Sustainability reporting covers a broad area. Standards can help companies simply meet legal requirements on specific public policy objectives in a given jurisdiction. But investors also need guidance when comparing global sustainability-related financial disclosures. As yet, no set of generally accepted standards exists. However, the process to formulate one has begun. Progress has followed two tracks: meeting the needs of all stakeholders; and meeting the needs of capital markets. So far, the bodies that oversee generally agreed international accounting principles have moved ahead more quickly than those watching over the US standards. In September 2020, the IFRS Foundation the international arbiter of accounting standards decided to establish an International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). Recently, it began a search for a chair and vice-chair. The IFRS Foundation preferred not to confuse financial accounting rules with this newer area of sustainability. That makes sense, as the latter has a fuzzier feel. Plus, sustainable investing includes a social aspect, which broadens the task of reporting greatly. It helps that the IFRS Foundation has broad credibility. It was created two decades ago as a not-for-profit, public interest organisation to harmonise the various financial accounting principles used around the world. Of course, for all the reams of information now provided in sustainability reports and ESG-related disclosures, such as carbon emissions, they do not play the same role as accounts. They will not necessarily help investors understand the health of a company as a going concern. But, while there is still a need for financial accounting guardrails on the path to sustainability, the pandemic has encouraged companies to widen their outlook and focus on all their stakeholders not just shareholders. This has not suited all parties involved in the oversight of company financial reporting, though including the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Objections to the ISSB in the US have hinged on its broad approach and the question of who has the right to set such standards for US investors. However, early this year, Allison Lee, interim SEC chair at the time, invited US investors and market participants to share their views on requirements for company disclosure on climate change. Gary Gensler, the SEC chair appointed by President Joe Biden, has since followed this up. In a speech in July, Gensler said there had been hundreds of requests from the public for guidance from the SEC on ESG. However, concerns expressed by commissioners appointed by the previous US administration, suggesting the ISSB would have too broad a mandate and consult with too many stakeholders, seem to have had an effect. Now, the new ISSB will aim to find standards that focus on the needs of investors, rather than all stakeholders.    That makes some sense, as straying too far from the material needs of capital markets could make for vague and even politically contentious standards. Also, the ISSB will start with climaterelated standards. Given the growing quantity of data made available by companies in their efforts to reduce global warming, that looks to be a sensible starting point and fits with the aims of the Biden administration. But that does not necessarily mean the US will agree to join the effort by the ISSB to establish standards. The SEC has a public mandate to regulate capital markets and facilitate capital formation. Whatever credibility the ISSB has, in the end, it can only provide guidance it has no legal powers. Still, other securities regulators, as represented by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (which includes the SEC), have backed the move by the IFRS Foundation for a global board. The SEC has also promised to provide some climate change reporting standards for the management discussion and analysis sections of companies' earnings reports by the end of this year. Many companies provide reports on meeting ESG criteria, but few publicly assess the financial risks for important areas such as climate risk, says Sue Harding, an accounting analyst. Harding knows, having contributed to a recent report by the Climate Accounting Project, an informal group of finance and investment executives, and think-tank Carbon Tracker. They found that of 107 multinational companies reviewed, more than 70 per cent provided no explicit financial analysis about climate risks. Keeping tabs on sustainable investment promises means international standards are required more than ever. Yet these will provide guidelines only on the data needed. Assessing the financial risk to companies and investors will be the necessary follow-on for any work on global sustainability standards.

2db03aa22b55e634d403,2021-11-01,'If we all make changes it can go a long way',"O verwhelmed by the magnitude of the climate crisis, many people say they feel powerless to make a difference. But, for some, even small changes whether cutting down on meat, switching to energy efficient lightbulbs or replacing a gas-guzzler with an electric car can have a positive impact on the environment. Here, we ask seven people about the personal choices and actions they are takingto help tackle climate change. From an airline chief executive and fast-food chain boss, to a ""period-pants"" entrepreneur and environmental activist, each one is already focused on sustainability at work. But they have also shared the steps are they taking at home to lead lower-carbon lifestyles. Kate Bassett Emily Shuckburgh Climate scientist and director of Cambridge Zero at the University of Cambridge On lifestyle choices: A lot of the small changes I've made in my personal life are simply about wasting less: being innovative in the kitchen so I minimise food waste; putting smart valves on to my radiators so I don't heat rooms I'm not using; and repairing things if possible or finding ways to reuse them. On making an impact: Get on your bike! I especially love my cargo bike, which I use every day to take my children to school. It was quite expensive but I've used mine so much that, in terms of pounds per mile, it has been an incredibly good investment. On leading change: I've spent 25 years studying climate change. After researching the frightening changes occurring in the polar regions and witnessing, with horror, the situation getting worse, I decided it was time to focus more of my efforts on the solution rather than the problem. Two years ago, I became the inaugural director of Cambridge Zero an ambitious climate change initiative by the University of Cambridge, generating ideas and innovations to help shape a sustainable zero-carbon future. Johan Lundgren CEO of easyJet, the low-cost airline On lifestyle choices: I've reduced my consumption of meat and stopped buying bottled water. The issue of climate change can seem too large for one person to make a tangible difference but, if we all make small changes, it can go a long way. On making an impact: Consumers need to look at what companies are doing to operate in the most sustainable way, and then vote with their feet only choosing those that are acting responsibly. On leading change: In 2019, I took the decision that easyJet would become the first major international airline to offset the emissions from the fuel used on behalf of all our customers. Since then, we've retired 3.9m credits. We selected all of our carbon offsetting projects using a rigorous selection process, choosing schemes that are either Gold Standard or Verified Carbon Standard certified. The projects we support are effectively preventing forest loss as well as delivering transformative benefits for wildlife and local communities. This is an interim step until we can become an early adopter of new zero-emission technology. Paul Pomroy Corporate senior vice-president of fast-food chain McDonald's On lifestyle choices: As a family, we try to use less, recycle more and buy from sustainable businesses. Practical things include energy efficient bulbs, smart meters, and timers on switches and appliances. My boys are learning about taking care of the planet at school and do litter picks on our family walks. On making an impact: Our big goal in the UK and Ireland is to make sure that, by 2027, McDonald's restaurant waste is given a second life so that nothing is truly wasted instead, it is recycled, reused or composted. Our restaurant teams are encouraged to complete three daily litter patrols, and we're investing in campaigns to help customers know what they can recycle. We all need to make sure we're putting our litter in the right bin.    On leading change: We recently launched Plan for Change, a sustainability strategy. By 2030, we aim to have eliminated deforestation from our supply chains and achieved net zero emissions for all our restaurants and offices. By 2040, we aim to reach net zero across our business and value chain in the UK. Tanya Steele UK CEO of WWF, the conservation group On lifestyle choices: I haven't eaten meat for more than 20 years, and now I'm reducing my fish and dairy consumption. As at work, we measure our carbon footprint at home, where we're on a green tariff for our energy. With household goods, my mantra is ""repair more, buy less"". I also walk a lot more you'll mostly find trainers on my feet and smart shoes in my handbag. On making an impact: We should all be checking that our pensions are part of the solution and that they are not invested in fossil fuels and other environmentally damaging practices. On leading change: Our Living Planet report shows that, in the past 50 years, we have destroyed nature, devastated wildlife, messed up the climate, and put people and the planet at risk. But the science shows that a different future is possible. At the UN climate summit in Glasgow, we have a historic opportunity. We can tackle the climate crisis by transforming our food and financial systems, moving rapidly to renewable forms of energy, and helping nature to recover. Governments and businesses must step up. Ruby Raut Environmental scientist and founder of reusable leak-proof ""period pants"" brand WUKA On lifestyle choices: This year, I switched to a Tesla electric car for my commute and invested in an electric bike for my weekend food shop; it's an enjoyable and convenient way to cart groceries up and down hills. We also changed our toilet to a ""smart"" bidet toilet, which has dramatically reduced our toilet paper consumption. I rarely eat meat and love making Nepalese vegetable curries. On making an impact: We all need to be mindful of how much we consume. Use less water. Turn off your lights. Use LED bulbs. Switch from single-use products to reusable products. Small habit changes can make a big reduction to your carbon footprint. On leading change: I launched the sustainable ""period pants"" brand WUKA in 2017. A pair of WUKA pants lasts up to two years, saves 200 tampons or pads from going to landfill, and produces 84 per cent less carbon emissions than disposable period products. Through periodpants.org, I'm calling on the UK government to remove the 20 per cent VAT on period pants. Sophia Mendelsohn Chief sustainability officer and global head of ESG at the technology company Cognizant On lifestyle choices: The most important change I've made is to become a more conscious consumer. Every dollar we spend is a signal to businesses about the role we expect them to play in addressing the climate crisis. Major companies are more attuned to changing customer habits and will adjust business practices and supply chains based on our expectations. On making an impact: This is today's problem not our grandchildren's. Consider climate in the context of your investments, home, and where you live. Second, read up on the science from sources you trust. Many of the same places you get your business news also have breakdowns of climate science. On leading change: For much of my career, I have been helping deliver sustainable businesses, including JetBlue Airways and multinational manufacturer Haworth. At Cognizant, I'm designing and executing a blueprint for a sustainable future, which includes our recent commitment to net zero emissions by 2030. Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim Environmental activist and president of the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad On lifestyle choices: I was raised in a nomadic community in Chad to only use what I need. I have always viewed nature as my ""supermarket"". Having seen the devastating impacts of climate change first-hand drought, floods and desertification I started a ""participatory mapping"" project. By combining technology and the traditional knowledge of indigenous people, we can map the land to better manage natural resources and reduce the risk of climate change-related conflicts. On making an impact: Use your voice to hold your government to account. Demand (and vote for) leaders who support climate safe policies, place climate change at the centre of all decisions and don't support the fossil fuel industry. On leading change: Indigenous people manage much of the world's nature, including many of the healthiest and most carbon dense ecosystems. We are just 5 per cent of the population, yet we protect 80 per cent of the world's biodiversity. There cannot be a solution to combat climate change if it does not include us.

a5f21eb9292b40654024,2021-11-01,Investors learn to exert pressure on heavy CO2 emitters,"Climate investment Many net zero pledges by businesses lack substance, writes Attracta Mooney As companies worldwide announce a barrage of commitments to reach net zero emissions by 2050, the role played by their biggest shareholders in holding them to their pledges is coming under scrutiny. A survey by Ninety One, the UK-listed investment manager, recently found that half of 6,000 individual investors polled across 10 countries believed asset managers should use their influence as shareholders of carbon-heavy companies to help cut emissions. Climate Action 100+, a coalition of big investors, earlier this year found that half of the world's largest carbon emitters had set net zero goals to cancel out their carbon emissions by 2050. But, in many cases, these pledges did not cover the full scope of their emissions. ""The decarbonisation of our economy has not even really begun and, if we wish to maintain our way of life, we need to overhaul the entire corporate ecosystem that underpins it,"" says Mathieu Chabran, co-founder of France-based Tikehau Capital. ""The financial sector is not yet doing enough."" Venetia Bell, chief sustainability officer at GIB Asset Management, says businesses are at ""different places on this journey"", with some better prepared than others for a transition to a cleaner economy. ""Decarbonising the world, as well as our portfolios, requires that we encourage the companies that are producing these emissions to make systemic improvements,"" she argues. To do this, investors need better disclosure of information to help them judge how companies are performing in cutting emissions and to see how this is aligns with their net zero ambitions, Bell argues. Asset managers are using several tools in an attempt to influence corporate behaviour around climate change. These include their ability to back greener companies or restrict investments into carbon-intensive companies. But they are also putting more emphasis on so-called stewardship and engagement, whereby investors try to influence companies through a combination of private boardroom discussions, issuing public letters, and voting at annual meetings. Asset managers such as BlackRock have begun voting against directors who they believe are not acting quickly enough to address climate change. At the same time, investor support for environmental resolutions at company meetings is on the rise. Tikehau Capital is launching specialist investment products designed to fight climate change while also applying pressure to companies in its mainstream portfolios to ""transition to a more sustainable future"". Similarly, US-based Wellington Management says it is focused on engagement rather than exiting carbon-intensive companies, as is M&G, the UK-listed asset manager. ""One of the things that some of our funds are doing is to encourage investee companies to adopt science-based targets to reduce their carbon emissions,"" says Rupert Krefting, head of corporate finance and stewardship at M&G.    M&G is working with other investors by jointly leading discussions on behalf of Climate Action 100+ members with two companies with large greenhouse gas emissions: miner Rio Tinto and chemicals company BASF. As well as launching specialist investment products that focus on encouraging moves to a lower-carbon economy, asset managers have also been overhauling existing portfolios to make them more climate-friendly. Mirza Baig, global head of ESG investments at Aviva Investors, says fellow asset managers must have a ""very clear objective"" of how their actions encourage efforts to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord. ""Simply managing a fund with a lower carbon intensity doesn't [mean] positive change in terms of Paris,"" he says. ""Whatever we do, it always needs to be driven by what is going to drive real-world change."" Others are looking beyond equity markets to try to push companies to cut emissions. Hans Stoter, global head of Axa Investment Managers Core, says the European investment house has a framework that sets out its expectations on listed fixed-income assets such as green bonds. However, despite these asset managers' growing focus on climate issues, many believe investors will have to get tougher because of the poor progress made to date. Research released by MSCI, the index provider, suggested that the goal of the Paris agreement to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C compared with pre-industrial levels was ""increasingly out of reach"". It said only 10 per cent of public companies were aligned with a more ambitious 1.5C temperature rise threshold. Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, one of the groups behind Climate Action 100+, says asset managers have made good progress on pushing companies but there is still much to do. She argues institutional investors need to be willing to square up to companies and publicly call out laggards if the world is to meet the goals set in Paris. ""There has been a real shift in the way companies are talking to us [investors] about climate change, but we are nowhere near where we need to get to,"" she says. ""We [investors] need to be doing much more."""
12a138fff71da2aa76d4,2021-11-01,Funding is needed for the transition from brown to green,"Financing Capital flows must match net zero emission pledges, writes Silvia Pavoni impact of its mining. Extracting lithium from the ground involves displacing vast amounts of groundwater and the risk of contributing to desertification. In 2050, the World Bank estimates that demand for the mineral will have grown to nearly five times the levels of production seen in 2018. Other raw materials essential for electric vehicles and renewable energy technology pose further quandaries. Cobalt, for example, is mostly produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo in hazardous conditions involving child labour, as campaign organisations have long warned. And this is something investors are well aware of, too. ""If you've ever seen a lithium mine or a cobalt mine, they're not the most environmentally friendly not to mention the social aspects around them,"" notes Robert Furdak, chief investment officer for environmental, social and governance (ESG) at Man Group. ""ESG aspects are oftentimes very nuanced, and you just have to understand the complications of some of these issues."" While technology is improving electric automaker Tesla is working on cobalt-free batteries evaluating the overall impact of investments is tricky. In addition, there are other factors that can make directing capital towards climate goals even trickier. While financing for green assets is abundant, financing the green transformation of heavy emitters is rather more arduous. Arguably, this is most evident in a jurisdiction such as the EU, which has created a green taxonomy setting clear boundaries between the ""colours"" of different companies but not guided on what is permissible, or even encouraged, in the transition from brown to green. This tension is exemplified by the still tentative market of transition bonds, intended to finance the process. ""Every time a client wants to issue a transition bond, they fear that [this will attract] a reputational risk,"" says Hacina Py, head of impact finance solutions at Société Générale. ""What is brown, according to the EU, is what is never going to become green but, in the middle, there is not enough space."" The European Commission's directorgeneral for climate action, Mauro Petriccione, admits that the EU could do ""a little better"" in clarifying its position and expectations regarding the energy sources needed in the transition to a greener economy. He says natural gas is essential in the short term, but that by 2050 it should be out of the system entirely. Speaking at a recent Financial Times conference, Petriccione added that, ""there are financial institutions that have taken the bull by the horns and gone ahead [with transition financing] and I don't think they have suffered [as a consequence]."" Though numbers remain low $4.5bn this year, according to data provider Refinitiv there are signs that transition bonds are set to grow. In February, the London Stock Exchange created a transition bond segment on its venue, expecting rising activity. Italian energy infrastructure company Snam has already tapped the market four times during 2020 and 2021, for a total of €2.35bn to help finance its 2040 net zero goals. And the supply of green bonds is still relatively low    compared with demand, leaving ESG investors looking for more the EU's debut green bond, to raise the groundbreaking sum of €12bn, was 11 times subscribed. Outside the EU, Dean Alborough, head of ESG at Old Mutual Alternatives, wishes regulators would encourage transition finance so that corporates, as well as multilateral banks, may feel inspired to tap the market. ""If there's a regulation that allows for this transition, development finance and private sector finance will be protected from a reputational perspective,"" he says. Some estimate low-carbon technologies will require over $90tn of investment over the next 15 years. Meanwhile, the financing of fossil fuel production is attracting more controversy. Many argue that green technology and infrastructure do not yet allow for the abandonment of this industry. ""There is still a lot of ground to [cover to] define exactly what transition is, and how you apply it in different sectors,"" says Demetrio Salorio, UK head of global banking and advisory at Société Générale. But he adds: ""We cannot abandon the financing of oil and gas today, it would be impossible."" As more countries and corporations declare their net zero commitments, they pose an immediate, practical question: is capital flowing in the right direction to help their pledges be met? While investment in green assets and technologies has grown, their popularity offers only part of the solution and raises new, complex problems. At the same time, if turning ""brown"" companies into green ones is intuitively beneficial, the financing of such a transition is far from straightforward. Spiralling demand for minerals such as lithium, for example, is indicative of a cleaner automotive industry as the material is integral to batteries powering electric cars. But it is also a cause of concern because of the environmental"
220a42094f3c3f6568bb,2021-11-01,ESG metrics trip up factor investors,"Green investing Adding an ethical tilt to a portfolio may not lead to better returns, writes Emma Boyde Asset managers and index providers are increasingly using scores for environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance in selecting and weighting stocks in a similar way to their application of smart beta factor metrics. But some experts now believe this approach is flawed. The first difficulty with using ESG performance scores in this way, according to Felix Goltz an academic and research director at Scientific Beta, a data provider is that there is confusion over the purpose. ""The starting point in the industry is that people believe ESG is a source of outperformance and, if it was [using the data in the same way as a factor-based approach], it would be a logical approach to follow,"" he says. However, research has shown that the correlation between a high ESG metric and outperformance declines over time, he points out. Style factors are used to construct smart beta indices of companies that score highly on persistent drivers of returns: for example, size (smaller, high-growth companies), or quality (financially healthy groups). But, even if the purpose of including ESG factors was to deliver only an ethical tilt, rather than higher returns, there are also flaws in that idea, says Patrick Wood Uribe, chief executive of Util, a UK sustainable investment data provider. Research from Util shows that, when measured against UN sustainable development goals, sustainable funds minimise negative ESG impacts at best, but have no significant positive effects. A further concern is the quality of the ESG data, Wood Uribe says. ""If you're strict about smart beta, you need very strong quantitative data and ESG, so far, is not up to that."" Mark Northway, investment manager at Sparrows Capital, agrees: ""We don't have enough knowledge or information about ESG-ranked portfolios to make an informed conclusion,"" he says, noting that, unlike for style factors, most ESG data have only been collected in a consistent fashion for the past decade. However, questioning whether it is right to use ESG alongside factors obscures the reality the practice is commonplace because the metrics generate usable numbers. ""Smart beta tends to rely on quantitative models, and it's straightforward to include a quantitative score for ESG into these models,"" says Bruno Taillardat, head of smart beta and factor investing at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager. Taillardat says it is important to recognise that ESG can have correlations to factors such as momentum (the idea that strong performance tends to persist), quality and value (when stocks are cheap relative to a company's fundamental value), but it can still be a useful tool. ""ESG is evolving, which means it has no structural bias to another factor,"" he says. ""It tends to be more correlated with quality than other factors, but it still changes over time."" To complicate the picture, though, Amundi research    has identified varied effects when using ESG alongside a factor-based approach, depending on whether it is added to a single factor or multi-factor portfolio and where the investments are. This research, published in May 2020, found that introducing ESG in a multi-factor US portfolio that was already well-diversified added little value, but that it was a significant diversification factor in a eurozone multi-factor portfolio. Goltz maintains, however, that while ""the trend is definitely to use ESG scores and try to use them alongside other factor considerations"", it was not appropriate to do so. ""Most, in fact, use the ESG score as a factor even though there is no evidence that it is a factor,"" he says. He says using ESG scores is easy, but it should be a separate consideration. Northway says that it might infuriate proponents of sustainable investing that ESG metrics were deemed unsuitable for use in a factor-based approach. But he suggests that they keep in mind the potential risks of doing so. ""It's more prudent for investors to assume that reducing the investment universe will have the effect of increasing concentration and tracking error, without necessarily improving performance"" he says. ""That doesn't take anything away from ESG investing, which is a socially responsible approach,"" he adds. ""But it does underline that the primary motivation for doing so should be social conscience rather than the naive expectation of higher returns."" The motivation for [ESG investing] should be social conscience rather than naive expectations of higher returns"
0e602b7966c1a8a4f9dd,2021-11-01,"Simple, low-cost ETFs lead race for investors' cash","Fund inflows Vanguard's easy to explain funds have found broad appeal, writes Rheaa Rao Vanguard's smart beta offerings are winning the race for investors' cash this year, even as BlackRock's iShares funds remain the market leaders. iShares' smart beta ETFs posted assets of $491bn as of September 30 — the highest among US fund providers, according to data from Morningstar Direct, the research group. However, iShares' flows in the first nine months of 2021 were less than half the level that Vanguard's smart beta funds garnered over the same period. Vanguard's $315bn smart beta line-up — the second largest among ETF providers — raked in $31bn over the nine months to September 30. iShares funds, meanwhile, drew in $11.7bn. Together, iShares and Vanguard's assets accounted for 65 per cent of the $1.24tn in US smart beta ETF assets, according to Morningstar. Their combined inflows made up nearly half of the $91bn that went into smart beta ETFs in the first nine months of 2021. Vanguard has been successful in smart beta because its lowcost offerings are straightforward compared with those of its rivals, reckons Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. Many smart beta funds are complex to explain to investors and are targeted at delivering exposure to specific stockpicking factors — such as growth, value or momentum — which may go in and out of favour as markets shift, he points out. But Vanguard's funds tend to make smaller factor bets and are usually tilted towards a single factor, Johnson explains. ""Vanguard's funds are easier to understand, easier to own,"" he says. ""You're not going to see the same level of volatility, same level of tracking error than if you were to invest in pure growth or value funds."" BlackRock, meanwhile, maintains its foothold in smart beta by identifying untapped niches, says Lukas Smart, head of US sustainable and factors at its iShares division. In October, iShares launched its USD Bond Factor ETF (USBF), which selects bonds based on macro, quality and value factors. The asset manager also plans to launch an ESG version of its $27.7bn USD Bond Factor ETF. That fund will invest in US companies that have lower volatility characteristics, as well as reduced carbon exposure and improved environmental, social and governance characteristics compared with those in its MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Extended ESG Reduced Carbon Target Index (MVEA). The intersection of sustainable investing and factor-based investing is rife with opportunity, Smart believes. Despite BlackRock and Vanguard's dominance, data suggest that rivals are catching up. Invesco's $106.9bn smart beta ETF line-up, which is the third largest in the sector, brought in $11.4bn during the first nine months of 2021, according to Morningstar. Charles Schwab's $80bn smart beta ETFs drew a combined $12.8bn over the same period, and the group is the fourth-largest provider of such funds.    Providers are attempting to gain market share by putting smart beta ETFs into the context of a diversified portfolio, Morningstar's Johnson says. ""Asset managers are increasingly building factor variants of model portfolios,"" he notes. Charles Schwab has made inroads with registered investment advisers through its ETF model portfolios that include its smart beta funds, says David Botset, head of strategy and product for Schwab Asset Management Solutions. Its models are available to advisers in paper form and through wealth management platforms such as Envestnet and Riskalyze, he adds. Schwab differentiates its smart beta line-up by showing clients how its funds can provide them with income that they may be challenged to find through fixed income funds in the current low-interest rate environment, Botset says. The fund manager, like BlackRock, also looks to add products in underserved niches, he adds. In April, Schwab Asset Management launched its Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF (SCHY), and the fund had brought in more than $130m by mid-October. Meanwhile, First Trust aims to differentiate itself from larger rivals through multifactor ETFs, instead of factor tilts or single-factor strategies, says Ryan Issakainen, senior vice-president and ETF strategist at the asset manager. First Trust identifies factors that work together at differenttimes, he says. ""We have acomplementary factorapproach, where we may lookat value alongside quality with each [factor] having the""potential to enhance theother,"" he says. First Trust is the fifth largest smart beta ETF provider with$60bn in assets as of September 30, according to Morningstar. Its line-up brought in$8.2bn in the first nine months of 2021. iShares' smart beta assets of $491bn are the highest among US fund providers"
5c054473faa0266fa0e9,2021-10-30,The world of finance will be judged on the $100tn climate challenge,"F inance is a service, a means to an end. It helps people achieve their goals whether buying a home, paying for their children's education, expanding their businesses, or saving for their retirements. To these ends, financial institutions are disciplined by hard numbers: debit and credit, profit and loss, return on investment, value at risk. Now people around the world are demanding sustainability in the face of the enormous climate challenge, and 192 governments have turned that somewhat amorphous goal into a specific objective limiting global temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This mission is also disciplined by numbers. Getting on track for 1.5C requires emissions to fall by 7.6 per cent every year throughout this decisive decade. So where do we stand? Since the UK assumed the presidency of COP26 in partnership with Italy last year, countries' net zero commitments have risen from covering one-fifth to over fourfifths of global emissions. That's huge progress but it's far from enough. Now we need ambitious climate policies by governments, aggressive climate actions by companies, and enormous financing from the mainstream financial system if we are to deliver on the numbers. That's why our COP private finance strategy has devised 24 major initiatives to build a financial system in which every decision made takes climate change into account. To supercharge these reforms, the UN and the COP26 presidency have created the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. GFANZ brings together the most ambitious firms in every sector of finance, from every continent. This is not another well-meaning but vague commitment to sustainability. As much as we might wish, we can't get to net zero by flipping a green switch. We need to rewire our entire economies. GFANZ members don't seek to be judged on style or by black box ESG ratings. They're disciplined by the hard numbers of the shift to net zero. And they haven't just committed to net zero financed emissions by 2050 at the latest. They also target their fair share of the 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that is needed by 2030 if we are to keep the world on track for 1.5C. They're developing detailed reduction plans, and will report all the emissions of their borrowers and investee companies annually. Hard numbers for true sustainability. To make all this add up, we must build a financial system entirely focused on net zero. That means defining bestpractice, science-based transition plans for companies and financial institutions. It means robust assessments of the portfolios of financial institutions. It means developing approaches to wind down stranded assets that could reach four-fifths of coal reserves and up to half of proven oil and gas reserves transparently and responsibly. And it means mobilising trillions of dollars of capital to finance decarbonisation in emerging and developing countries a hitherto unimaginable number but without which real sustainability is not possible. Given the enormous resources of GFANZ, a radical new approach to mobilising private capital investment in emerging market and developing economies can be developed. Specifically, we need a country platform for each nation to achieve its emis- sions reductions goals including the phasing out of coal generation and other fossil fuels by deploying a blend of public and private finance and technical assistance. At Glasgow, look for specific proposals and financing commitments consistent with this approach, and remember that if something cannot quickly scale to $100bn a year, it is a soft number that will not change the climate.    The imperative of a just green transition underscores the reality that finance never acts in isolation. Governments must back their net zero commitments with clear, credible, and concrete policies. Our alliance has set out what we believe are the necessary policies. This includes carbon pricing, bans on internal combustion vehicles, national targets to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and mandatory climate-related financial disclosures. The more these are implemented, the more finance will have the certainty and confidence to invest early, which will smooth the shift to zero carbon, drive growth and jobs upwards and help force emissions downwards. All of this points to a final hard number: $100tn. This is the minimum amount of external finance needed for the sustainable energy drive over the next three decades if it is to be effective. Next week in Glasgow, look for who is part of the $100tn solution. Does it include your bank, insurer, mutual fund manager, or pension fund? Your money matters. In the months and years ahead, judge all financial institutions not by what they say but by their numbers: the total dollars of transition financing, the amount of polluting, the stranded assets retired, the emissions eliminated and the timelines to get to net zero. Hard numbers in service of all people and our planet that's the real bottom line. The writer is the UN's special envoy on climate action and finance and was the governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020 We can't get to net zero by flipping a green switch. We need to rewire our entire economies"
81b878a967a5812696b0,2021-10-29,T Rowe Price to buy Oak Hill for $4.2bn,"Financials Acquisition allows asset manager to seek growth in private credit, says chief T Rowe Price is buying credit manager Oak Hill Advisors for up to $4.2bn in cash and shares, in a deal that marks the latest example of consolidation in the asset management industry and illustrates growing appetite for alternative strategies. Bill Stromberg, T Rowe chief executive, said that the acquisition was the Baltimore-based group's largest dollar deal to date. He said it would allow the group to pursue growth opportunities in private credit as more institutions and even wealthy individuals to mass affluent clients seek exposure to the sector. T Rowe, which has $1.61tn in assets under management and is one of the world's top active managers, said yesterday that it would acquire 100 per cent of the equity of New York-based Oak Hill, which has $53bn in assets under management across private, distressed, special situations, liquid, structured credit, and real asset strategies. Under the terms of the acquisition, $3.3bn is payable at closing, about 74 per cent in cash and 26 per cent in T Rowe common stock, and up to an additional $900m in cash is payable if business targets are reached. The high price reflects demand for private capital and the competition for deals in the sector. Rob Sharps, president and head of investments at T Rowe who takes over as chief executive in January, said: ""There are three areas that investors are allocating their money towards. Passive, ESG and private markets. Passive is not a strategic aim for us,"" he added. ""We are building our ESG presence, so that leaves private markets."" When asked about the mid to high teens multiple on the deal, Sharps said: ""We think it's a fair deal."" T Rowe's funds focus on equity, fixed income and multi-asset strategies, and it said it had limited overlap with Oak Hill in terms of investment strategies and clients. Oak Hill will become its private markets platform with the two firms planning to explore expansion into other alternative strategies in time. Analysts highlighted that T Rowe was seeking to shift from being an active asset manager focused mainly in equities. Kyle Sanders, analyst at Edward Jones, said that T Rowe had ""needed more diversification"" and that Oak Hill provided ""immediate access to fast-growing private credit markets, instantly filling a hole in their product line-up to meet client demands"". The acquisition comes as investors turn to private capital strategies in their search for yield in a low-return environment. The overall industry, which includes sectors such as private credit, private equity and infrastructure, grew to $7.4tn at the end of 2020 and is expected to hit $13tn by the end of 2025, according to Morgan Stanley. Oak Hill will operate as a standalone business within T Rowe. Its founder and chief executive Glenn August will continue in his role and is expected to join the acquirer's board of directors and management committee. The deal is set to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval.    '[The deal] gives access to fast-growing private credit markets ... filling a hole in their product line-up'"
951bc6493a47d7f7e0bf,2021-10-29,"A MINEFIELD OF METRICS IN THE VAST POOL OF DATA ON ESG PERFORMANCE, HOW CAN INVESTORS SEE THE IMPACT THEIR MONEY IS MAKING?","Sustainable investing may be gratifying for wealthy individuals and families, but it is far from simple. A lack of standards in the measurement and reporting of ESG (environmental, social and governance) products and funds can leave investors confused. And when it comes to impact investments, capturing the right data takes time, effort and, often, a hands-on approach. The problem for ESG investors is not a lack of data but an oversupply of tools and frameworks. ""There is a plethora of standards and different levels of disclosure in the market,"" says Amy Clarke, chief impact officer at London-based Tribe Impact Capital, a wealth manager. ""It can be really challenging to understand what measures are meaningful."" Julia Paino, co-chair of impact investing at Nexus, an international network of young investors and philanthropists, describes a frustration she shares with her peers: ""When you peel back the layers, a lot of the third-party agencies measuring for ESG are compiling metrics that reward fundamentally unsustainable companies,"" she observes, from her base in Boston. To add to investors' confusion, different providers often come up with different scores for the same company. For example, California-based investment manager Research Affiliates last year found that, with the exception of environmental scores, two rating providers assessed every dimension of Wells Fargo's ESG performance differently, one giving the bank a far better result than the other. ""Buyer beware,"" says Liesel Pritzker Simmons, who with her husband Ian Simmons runs US-based Blue Haven Initiative, an impact investing-focused family office. ""With some ratings, you get an A-plus just for putting out a climate report, and with others you actually have to produce a good climate report."" Darshita Gillies, founder and chief executive of Maanch, a digital impact measurement platform based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals, identifies a more fundamental problem. ""Before you even get into how to navigate the ESG landscape from a private wealth or family office perspective, there is no standard definition of what an ESG product is,"" she says. Another challenge for investors is that dozens of standard setters have emerged in recent years, each with a different acronym and measurement methodology ? something known as ESG's ""alphabet soup"". As concerns mount about greenwashing in sustainable finance, the EU has introduced rules to establish what can be considered a sustainable investment fund, setting tough disclosure requirements for asset managers that want to market a fund as a sustainable product. More developments in standards are on the horizon. One of the most significant could be the launch next month by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (which oversees international accounting standards) of the International Sustainability Standards Board, which will set standardised ESG reporting metrics.    However, for wealthy individuals and families whose investment choices are driven primarily by the desire to make a social or environmental impact, standardised measurement tools and tick-box approaches may not always yield the information they are seeking. ""There is a desire to have an easy-to-use framework,"" says Diane Seymour-Williams, a partner at London-based Acorn Capital Advisers. ""But what is really important is what is behind the ticking of the box and the resources that have been deployed by asset and wealth managers to understand what is going on in a company."" Finding the right approach depends on whether investors are putting their money into public equities and funds or are making direct investments into privately held assets through venture capital and private equity deals. ""Family offices and individual investors manage a lot of their direct investing portfolio in house and have stafflooking at impact metrics for those direct deals,"" says Naina Batra, chief executive of AVPN, an Asian network of philanthropists and social investors. ""But they farm out the public market investments to private banks and asset managers."" In some cases, family offices with sufficient resources track the impact of their public market investments in house, says Batra. She cites Singapore's Tsao Family Office, which focuses on responsible investments through public and private equities and fixed income investments, and which, she says, has developed its own measurement capabilities for all these assets. For those who outsource impact management and measurement, selecting the right manager is critical, says Pritzker Simmons. ""In our public-equity portfolio, we have been split between active and passive managers,"" she says. ""Our active managers have been chosen because of their point of view on sustainability."" These professionals, she says, can push for improvements in the sustainability performance of companies in the portfolio. ""They work with management teams to move them from moderate to good or from good to great,"" she says. ""We trust those managers."" This is the approach taken by US-based Veris Wealth Partners, which specialises in impact and sustainable investing. ""We select best-in-class managers in all asset classes, so a lot of our due diligence is of how the manager does diligence around E, S and G metrics,"" says Stephanie Cohn Rupp, Veris chief executive. As stock markets offer families and individuals fewer opportunities to personally influence the performance of their investments, many prefer to focus on impact investing through private holdings. Unlike listed equities, private equity or venture capital investments make it possible for investors to gain direct insights into the difference their money is making. However, this requires some effort. ""You have to work really hard to find the information to make the right judgment calls on whether the business is going to deliver the type of change we are collectively looking for,"" says Clarke at Tribe Impact Capital. Social impact projects are diverse and difficult to compare, which means impact-focused private equity or venture capital investments do not lend themselves to being assessed through ESG rating systems or the frameworks of organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (see panel, right). ""On the private side, it is really about how the manager assesses impact,"" says Cohn Rupp. Rather than presenting raw data to its clients, the firm provides impact reports to show how their money is making a difference. ""You never show pure ESG scores to clients because they are meaningless and they don't really tell a story,"" she says. There has to be a degree of pragmatism in impact investment, says Acorn's Seymour-Williams, ""because a framework doesn't necessarily address the precise circumstances of an investment"". But precise metrics are something Boston-based investor Paino sees as becoming more important to impact investors. ""Five or 10 years ago, it was acceptable to talk about ESG impact broadly, but now it's getting more granular,"" she says. Paino is a partner in Desert Bloom Food Ventures, a fund that invests in and supports the growth of sustainable food companies. She cites Hungry Harvest, one of Desert Bloom's portfolio companies, which reduces food waste by recovering and selling fresh produce ? more than 12,000 tonnes to date ? that would otherwise be discarded. Hungry Harvest tracks exactly how much produce has been recovered, she says, and ""those kinds of underlying metrics are of the utmost importance to understanding a company's positive impact"".    To make sure they are using the right metrics, investors or their advisers must engage directly with companies they are investing in. ""Usually, we work with the management teams, whether it is a fund or a company, to determine what those metrics should be,"" says Pritzker Simmons. The complexity of social problems and variation in local market conditions mean the resulting data are not always easy to compare, nor can the same measurement methodologies be applied to every impact investment. This is something Blue Haven has learnt through trial and error. ""When we tried to roll everything up into one pretty dashboard, it didn't work and it didn't tell us anything useful,"" says Pritzker Simmons. ""Trying to compare a pay-as-you-go solar company in Kenya with an online platform for early childhood development in California doesn't make any sense. They're really different and doing different things in the world."" Even so, efforts are being made to add rigour and standardisation to the measurement of impact investments. For example, TPG Capital's The Rise Fund, co-founded by Bono, the Irish rock star, and JeffSkoll, the first president of eBay, developed the Impact Multiple of Money process, which was spun offas Y Analytics. The process includes screening out companies with low potential for impact; examining a company's social or environmental goals and whether they are measurable and achievable; and research that puts a dollar value on the intended social or environmental impact. Meanwhile, the Impact Management Project (IMP), a global consensus-building forum, has identified five dimensions that investors can use to measure the social and environmental performance of assets in their portfolios. The first three ? ""What"", ""Who"" and ""How Much"" ? help investors build a profile of the companies in which they are investing by asking questions about the gap or shortfall an enterprise is seeking to fill, who is benefiting from its products and services, how many people are being served and the level of change they are experiencing as a result. The fourth and fifth dimensions ? ""Contribution"" and ""Risk"" ? enable investors to assess whether their investments are generating positive changes that would not have occurred otherwise and to highlight the risks to that impact, as well as the potential consequences to society and the environment of those risks. To gain insights into how investments portfolios are contributing more broadly to people and the planet, the IMP suggests using the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a framework. It is not alone in seeing the SDGs as a tool to assess the impact of sustainable investments. ""The beauty with the SDG framework is that you have the targets that are set and you have the key performance indicators behind those targets,"" says Clarke. ""Those are very translatable for an investment manager."" She argues, however, that while the metrics will improve, investors who care about making a difference with their money must keep on asking tough questions. ""Impact investing is a bit like investigative journalism ? you are peeling back the layers all the time to get to the essence of the story and find out what has happened,"" she says. ""So we tell clients, 'Don't be afraid to ask those questions.'"" PHOTO: ALPHABET SOUP: A GUIDE TO ESG REPORTING BODIES The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) launched its sustainability-focused reporting guidance in 1997 (its Global Sustainability Standards Board sets standards for sustainability reporting). Organisations such as the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) and B Lab later developed impact assessment methodologies. Some organisations provide reporting guidance on an industry basis. For example, in 2018, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) launched a set of standards covering financially material issues for companies in 77 industries. Others take a single issue as the focus for reporting guidance ? such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which has become the leading framework for corporate climate change disclosure. Efforts to streamline and standardise ESG reporting have led to collaboration that could make life easier for companies, investors and their advisers. In April, B Lab and the GIIN, for example, aligned their impact assessment tools, enabling investors to use B Lab's tool, the B Impact Assessment, and the GIIN's Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (IRIS+) together. In June, the SASB and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) merged, to become the Value Reporting Foundation.

1849a1e45cbc7ebf4961,2021-10-29,EDITOR'S LETTER FEARS OF BOTH HIGH INFLATION AND LOW RATES VEX THE RICH,"Are the rich worried about inflation? Or about persistently low interest rates? The answer is both. In a Goldman Sachs survey of family offices, two-thirds of respondents said they were looking closely at inflation. And the same share said they had their eyes on ultra-low rates. You might conclude that the wealthy and their investment managers are uncertain about the future, just like the rest of us. Or that they are just being cautious, making sure that they are ready for a range of monetary scenarios. But where the rich stand out from less well-off investors is in the range of investments they can access, especially in private markets. So, family offices that are particularly concerned about inflation risks are piling into hard assets, notably real estate. It is a sector where the rich often feel comfortable, not least because many have dealt in property already, as buyers of homes and offices for themselves and their families. Or as Goldman's report, published this summer, puts it: ""We see family offices exhibiting a more hands-on approach, particularly if they have ample experience in owning and operating real estate."" Meanwhile, family offices more focused on the low-rate environment are investing in operating businesses, where profits and cash flow are less dependent on financial markets than portfolio investments. More broadly, family offices invest a much bigger portion of their portfolios in alternative that is, unlisted investments: fully 45 per cent on average in the Goldman survey of 150 family offices around the world. Among less-rich investors, even 20 per cent is seen as a high figure. For ordinary retail savers, the levels are negligible. This disparity is one reason why the ultrawealthy have seen their investments rise faster in recent years including during the pandemic than even the averagely rich, as price rises for these assets have outstripped public markets. LETTER BOTH RATES RICH A bigger risk appetite is part of the story. If you don't rely on your savings for a pension, it's easier to take a few gambles, though nobody wants to lose money, as was discovered by those clients of Credit Suisse whose money was advanced to the failed supply chain finance company Greensill Capital. Another factor is the high threshold needed for many kinds of private equity, private debt and venture capital investment. If the minimum is $100,000 or more, and you need to make several such investments to spread your risk, then only the very rich can participate. Wealth managers would naturally add that their advice also plays a valuable role in sourcing the best opportunities and smartly executing deals. There are doubtless brilliant investment managers around but track records are hard to judge as the publicly available data is rarely sufficiently robust. At the same time, many family offices are taking account of ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues, though they vary widely as to how far they apply these concerns. While 60 per cent of survey respondents said they were extremely or moderately focused on ESG in their investment strategy, that still left 40 per cent who were not, with 19 per cent saying they were ""not at all focused on ESG"". Plenty of work to be done there by ESG lobbies and by the many wealth managers who boast of their commitment to the cause. Finally, the rich seem as uncertain as the rest of us about cryptocurrencies. Only about 15 per cent of those polled reported crypto exposure. Still, with many wealthy investors worried about currency debasement given the flood of central bank liquidity, nearly half of respondents indicated they may be interested in crypto in future.    Among those with doubts, the most common reason was a view that they ""are not a good store of value"". In this debate, it seems, the very rich are little different from the rest of us.

f29a6ca4bcab95920859,2021-10-28,Embrace high fossil fuel prices because they are here to stay,"F or some energy watchers, higher prices for natural gas, coal and oil will be ""transitory"" to use the language of the US Federal Reserve. They are wrong. High prices are here to stay for years. The seeds were sown in oil's golden era between 2010 and 2014 when oil prices averaged above $100. Booming US shale production over that period and predictions of impending peak oil demand have left the market severely short of investment in conventional oil since 2015. Indeed, the number of oilfield discoveries between 2016 and 2020 fell to a record low while new LNG export projects slowed after a decade of low gas prices caused by a wave of new supply. Traditionally, higher prices balance the market by encouraging more supply and curbing demand. An inventory and spare-capacity cushion acts as a global shock absorber until higher prices spur production to balance rising demand. But the energy transition is changing the rules of engagement. So far, the supply response to elevated prices has been muted. Global upstream capital expenditure averaged $320bn-$350bn in 2020 and 2021. This is half the level of 2011-14 and 25 per cent short of what is needed to hold oil production steady at 100m b/d, the level global demand has now surpassed as mobility restrictions ease. ESG considerations account for much of the decline in capital expenditure by international oil companies in recent years and the investor exodus out of oil and gas markets. It will not end with higher oil and gas prices. Today, investment in fossil fuel is vilified and financing has become sparse as big western banks withdraw. The International Energy Agency is calling for an end to all oil, gas and coal funding if the world is to reach net zero by 2050. Due to long lead times between investment and supplies, we are yet to see the full impact of this slowdown in spending on conventional oil and gas production. In other words, supplies will continue to lag behind demand for the next few years. This is particularly true as US shale producers are focusing on shareholder returns and preserving cash flow a significant change from the past 10 years. But the focus on ESG hasn't had the same impact on demand. Oil demand and energy demand in general is extremely sticky. Fossil fuels accounted for 84 per cent of global energy demand in 2020, unchanged from 1980. The only real change was a slight shift from coal to gas. Renewables are making inroads but largely in developed economies. From a global perspective, hydrocarbons remain in pole position. Energy demand will continue rising as the world's population grows. During the peak of lockdowns last year, oil consumption fell 20 per cent year on year but it is expected to return to prepandemic levels in the second half of 2022. The IEA and OPEC secretariat agree on this timeframe.    Anyone who three years ago thought Elon Musk would have made oil obso- lete by now must feel a little confused. The truth is, global demand is responding far more slowly than supply to environmental concerns. This means sharply higher prices for fossil fuels coal prices today are at a record high. Technological leaps aside, higher prices are the most effective catalyst of changes in demand-side behaviour. After all, there is always a price that ensures demand equals supply. True, this can lead to pain for consumers and prompt panic among governments. Already, China, Germany and the US are designing measures to ease the green energy burden. The US is even considering tapping into its strategic petroleum reserve to ease oil prices at the pump. But keeping oil, gas and electricity prices artificially lower prevents consumers from adjusting their demand patterns and implies a slower shift to green energy. Shifting capital from hydrocarbon production is crucial for a successful transition. But global emissions will not drop if fossil fuel demand does not decline and prices will be high so long as demand is high. So, if governments are serious about climate change, the focus cannot just be on legislation that shifts supply. They must tackle demand. High energy prices, even if unpopular with voters, will be needed if we are to have any chance of meeting the ambitious energy targets set by governments. Complex debates surround the transition but there are two certainties: the transition is inflationary and achieving it will require stark trade-offs. Tackling climate change will be costly.

fe34ef574e66b888d752,2021-10-28,Apple resists shareholder votes on use of forced labour,"? Pressure builds over ESG standards ? Activists allege 'tainted' supply chain Apple is fighting to prevent shareholder votes at its next annual meeting on issues ranging from calls for more transparency about the use of forced labour in its supply chain to how it decides which apps to delete from its App Store. The sensitive issues are among six petitions from shareholders that also call for the company to take action on how easy it is for its devices to be repaired, its use of non-disclosure agreements and on incorporating more sustainability measures in its business. The number of petitions is the highest Apple has faced since 2017, suggesting that pressure over governance and sustainability issues is growing. A record 12 proposals on environmental issues filed at US companies have gained majority shareholder support this year, says law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, as big asset managers including BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard agitate for environmental, social and governance issues. The Securities and Exchange Commission published the proposals and Apple's rebuttals this week. Companies routinely challenge shareholder proposals at the SEC, and the agency will determine which of the Apple proposals go to a vote next year. The SEC has indicated that it is taking ESG issues more seriously, issuing a ""risk alert"" in April saying that ""disclosures"" and ""marketing claims"" around ESG issues needed to be ""accurate and consistent with internal firm practices"". Apple's challenge to the proposals did ""risk jeopardising ESG goodwill"", said Jackie Cook, director of sustainability stewardship research at Morningstar. Activist group SumOfUs is calling on Apple to be more transparent over allegations that it has relied on forced labour in China. The Campaign for Accountability, a non-profit research group, has filed a formal complaint with US Customs and Border Protection alleging that Apple's supply chain was ""tainted"" with forced labour in China. Eli Friedman, who spent three years advising Apple on ethical working conditions in its supply chain, said: ""For a long time Apple has had pretty rigorous standards, on paper, related to labour rights, environmental rights and freedom of association, but the reality is they are not rigorously enforced."" Apple told the SEC that it had already ""substantially implemented"" what SumOfUs had requested. Another proposal, from Nia Impact Capital, alleged that Apple was exposing itself to risks by extending its culture of secrecy beyond intellectual property to ""workplace culture"" issues such as discrimination claims. Nia asked Apple to assess potential risks from its policy, reminding the tech group that Alphabet paid $300m last year to settle shareholder lawsuits alleging a toxic work environment. The proposal comes after hundreds of Apple workers have organised under the banner of #Appletoo to describe ""patterns"" of mistreatment and to call for accountability.    Two prominent Apple employees, Ashley Gjovik and Janneke Parrish, have also alleged that they were fired in recent weeks for speaking up about workplace issues. Apple told the SEC that the proposal was moot, as recent employees already had the ""right to speak freely about your wages, hours, or working conditions"". 'Apple has had pretty rigorous standards, on paper ... but they are not rigorously enforced'"
d9425734622ed33accff,2021-10-28,ESG version of $200bn ETF launched with lower weightings for tech titans,"Equities A new version of one of the world's biggest exchange traded funds will manage holdings adhering to environmental, social and governance criteria, and one feature will be lower weightings for some technology titans including Tesla, Facebook and Amazon. The $200bn QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 stock index, is the secondmost actively traded exchange traded fund. Yesterday, the fund manager Invesco launched ESG versions for investors in the US and Europe based on a new form of the index created by Nasdaq in June. Some of the new weightings may come as a surprise, as many tech groups typically score high on ESG measures. Yet the likes of Amazon, Google, Tesla and Facebook have lower ESG-weighted rankings than their current Nasdaq 100 weights based on market capitalisation. The new weights gauge how effectively companies are managing their ESG risks and are based on data collected by Sustainalytics, a unit of Morningstar. The electric car pioneer Tesla's ""management of human capital and product governance risks reveals significant shortcomings"", said Sustainalytics. Meanwhile, the tech groups Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia will become more dominant members in the ESG version of the Nasdaq 100 index and the Invesco ETF. ""The management of ESG issues is part of the ratings process,"" said Lauren Dillard, head of investment intelligence at Nasdaq. Six companies that comprise the Nasdaq 100 are not present in the ESG version of the index because of a methodology that excludes companies deriving revenues from sources that include military weapons, nuclear power, oil and gas and thermal coal. Among the excluded companies are Exelon, American Electric Power and Xcel Energy all utilities as they derive more than 4.9 per cent of their annual revenue from electricity generated by nuclear or coal plants, according to the index methodology. Removing these groups ""improved the already low ESG risk rating [of the Nasdaq 100] by 10 per cent"", Invesco said. Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research, said: ""We're seeing a growing number of ESG alternatives to popular index-based strategies, and these provide investors and advisers with an alternative.""    Investors have increasingly focused on ESG funds in the past two years, rewarding fund providers such as Black- Rock and Invesco. Passively managed ETFs with a primary ESG mandate had received $24bn for the year to October 22 after a record inflow of $27.5bn during 2020, according to FactSet."
884f021599ee7a2fb418,2021-10-26,Not all green jobs are safe and clean,"I n a decarbonising global economy, metals may be the new oil. Demand for copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium is likely to surge in the next two decades because of their importance to clean energy technologies, according to the IMF. This will have wide-reaching implications for the countries that produce them. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, accounts for about 70 per cent of global cobalt output and 50 per cent of reserves. Yet cobalt mining there also has well-documented problems with dangerous conditions and child workers, raising questions about the human labour required to help turn the global economy green. Politicians are promising a ""green jobs"" bonanzaas they prepare to meet in Glasgow for the UN Climate Change conference at the end of this month. It is smart politics, not least because the term ""green jobs"" summons up images of people planting trees, insulating homes and working in spotless factories to build electric cars. The investment industry also has a tendency to conflate ""good for the environment"" with ""good for employees"", for example by lumping the categories together in corporate ESG ratings. But if the term ""green job"" means any occupation which helps to restore or preserve the environment, then it applies just as much to someone scrabbling in a hole for cobalt as to someone making wind turbine blades. The truth is that some jobs involved in greening the economy are dirty and dangerous, and not just the ones in mines. As the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has put it: ""We tend to associate the word 'green' with safety but what is good for the environment is not necessarily good for the safety and health of workers who are employed in green jobs."" The recycling industry is another example. While it is important to reduce the amount of goods going to landfill, recycling jobs can be hazardous, low paid and insecure. Statistics from the Health and Safety Executive, the UK regulator, show the rate of fatal injuries in the waste and recycling sector is 17 times higher than the average across all industries, second only to the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector. Many big recycling centres use both machines and humans, who stand at conveyor belts in ""sorting cabins"" and pick through the moving waste. An HSE study, which involved visits and air sampling in seven Materials Recycling Facilities, found some workers exposed to high levels of dust and endotoxins. The researchers surveyed 100 of the workers; 84 per cent reported health problems which they attributed to their job, such as skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms. This is not an argument against greening the economy. Many carbon-intensive jobs are dirty and dangerous too, and we will all suffer if we don't tackle climate change. But smarter planning could make some of these ""dirty green jobs"" safer. Electronics recycling is a case in point. There are valuable metals to be extracted from the mountains of electronic gadgets people are discarding (some people call this ""urban mining""). But the processes involved in recycling e-waste can release a number of toxic chemicals such as lead, mercury and brominated flame retardants. This is a particular dangerwhen waste is sent to developing countries such as Ghana, where it is recycled informally, but even in formal settings it can cause problems. Researchers in the US have found workers in e-waste recycling centres with overexposure to lead and cadmium. In one case, a worker's small children suffered    lead poisoning after he inadvertently brought lead home on his clothes and in his hair (his employer did not provide showers). These problems could be improved by encouraging manufacturers to change the design of new products so that they can be disassembled and recycled more safely. Recent moves by the US, UK and EU to require manufacturers to make their products more repairable should also help. That means designing products so they can be repaired independently, providing manuals and making spare parts available. Done correctly, these laws should help reduce waste as well as provide new skilled jobs. Health and safety and employment regulators need to step up scrutiny of those occupations which are set to expand quickly as the world takes on the task of reducing its carbon emissions. There is plenty to be gained from the transition to a low-carbon economy, but it would be a mistake simply to assume green jobs will be good jobs. As Guy Ryder, the director-general of the International Labour Organization, has put it: ""Green jobs will be made 'decent' not by default, but by design."" sarah.oconnor@ft.com 'What is good for the planet is not necessarily good for the safety and health of workers'"
c475be45e083ec2f0774,2021-10-26,Canadian pension fund set for $12bn Europe spree,"Fixed incomes One of Canada's largest pension fund managers has unveiled plans for a C$15bn ($12bn) spending spree on private assets in the UK and Europe in a significant expansion of its efforts to drive up returns offshore. Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec (CDPQ), the C$400bn global investment group, told the Financial Times that it planned to deploy around those funds to the region over the next four years, with the UK standing out because of its ""pro business"" stance. The investment manager's allocation to Europe stands at roughly 14 per cent of its portfolio and is ""concentrated in the UK and France"", said Charles Emond, president and chief executive. ""We anticipate growing this figure in the coming years mainly due to opportunities we see across Europe for private investments in our sectors of expertise and interest, including financial services, financial technology, private credit, infrastructure, real estate, healthcare and the energy transition."" CDPQ, which invests on behalf of pension and insurance plans with millions of members and policyholders, said that it would continue to invest in the UK and France, but was also ""looking closely"" at other European countries such as Germany, Spain and those in the Nordic region. Over six months to the end of June this year CDPQ posted a return of 5.6 per cent, above its benchmark index's 4.4 per cent return. CDPQ revealed its European ambitions as cash-strapped governments around the world court foreign capital in an effort to tap finance for infrastructure programmes and fund their switch to low-carbon economies. Emond was one of dozens of global asset management leaders who attended a UK government investment summit in London last week. ""I was impressed with the sales pitch"" said Emond. ""They really stand out as pro-business."" CDPQ is also one of the biggest investors in the world in renewables, such as wind farms and solar power areas that the UK and other governments see as prime targets for private investment. In September, CDPQ announced plans to accelerate its climate strategy by taking measures including offloading oil producers from its portfolio by the end of 2022 and holding C$54bn of green assets by 2025. Emond said that it was getting harder to find green assets at a good price: ""ESG inflows is record on record, so buying existing renewable assets you are paying through the nose,"" he said. Similarly he said infrastructure was ""a crowded space"" with supersized institutional investors, including Australian and Dutch pension funds, vying for the same deals.

Had KKR been in the S&P 500, the cousins would have been in a small group scaling heights alongside nine other CEOs including Tesla's Elon Musk, Fabrizio Freda of Estée Lauder and MSCI's Henry Fernandez. With business leaders facing economic disruption, unsteady supply chains and an increased ESG focus, delivering for shareholders has become a tricky balancing act. It has opened the door to activist pressure. According to Lazard, capital deployed in new campaigns hit $8.5bn this quarter, up from $4.7bn last year, with more than 15 new campaigns started in the past three weeks. This analysis looks at which chief executives of listed companies have created value and which have not by calculating annualised returns during their tenures. It is easily understood and hard to distort. Of 660 bosses across three indices the S&P 500, FTSE 100 and Stoxx 600 excluding UK constituents 49 were found to have negative annualised returns. Four CEOs exceeded average annual returns of 100 per cent; each only just met the three-year tenure mark. Patrick Mathurin and Chris Campbell"
5be785fee68b3153d49d,2021-10-23,Shareholders turn up the heat on climate debate,"Retail investors can make their voices heard and push for change if they band together, writes Alice Ross D avid Gowenlock, a financial services professional, was at his office near London's Old Street when he got an email from his father, who was feeling a bit emotional. ""It looks like you were successful,"" his dad wrote. Attached was the news that HSBC was phasing out its financing of coal companies, after a campaign by the bank's shareholders including Man Group, the biggest listed hedge fund in the world, and Amundi, the largest asset manager in Europe. Another of those shareholders was 35-year-old Gowenlock. He was an electronic engineer when he decided to switch career to work in a field combating climate change. After studying for an MBA he got a job as an adviser to venture capital and private equity fund managers on impact investing strategies. Then he came across ShareAction, a non-governmental organisation that has brought high-profile resolutions at some of the UK's biggest companies, from HSBC to Barclays and Tesco, to push them to become more environmentally or socially responsible. Through them, he added his name to the HSBC resolution. ""I saw the power of money can be a force for good,"" he says. Gowenlock is one of a growing number of small shareholders who are trying to use their position as investors to help bring change at large corporations. With the UN's COP26 conference on climate change Glasgow starting on October 31, awareness of the risks that rising temperatures are posing to companies across the world has been growing. While some retail investors are choosing to ditch oil and gas companies in their portfolios, others are teaming up with institutional investors to push boards to take action. Retail investors who want to get more involved largely have to rely on their own initiative. They can make sure they are registered to vote at AGMs, where companies are increasingly putting climate change proposals on the agenda. Or, they can contact pressure groups such as ShareAction for free and offer to get involved in shareholder resolutions. There are more and more opportunities for investors big and small to have their say on the climate risks facing the companies they invest in. Climate change votes have been an increasing feature of annual general meetings across the world's largest companies in the past year. In October 2020, Spanish airports operator Aena became the first company in the world to give its shareholders an annual vote on its plans to tackle climate change. That was in a response to an initiative from one of its largest shareholders, billionaire UK hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Hohn, through his TCI Fund Management group. A campaign by Hohn called Say on Climate urges companies to disclose emissions, present a plan to reduce them and give shareholders a yearly vote on it. In July, more than 50 investors including JPMorgan Asset Management and M&G built on the ""say on climate"" campaign by demanding that companies disclose their plans to cut emissions and allow shareholders to vote on them every year.    Unilever, Glencore, Moody's and Nestlé all said they would introduce a vote on climate plans this year. And support for shareholder resolutions on climate change has hit a record high with more than half of investors on average backing such resolutions against just a third in 2020, according to Proxy Insight, a data provider. Activist groups that collect retail and institutional shareholders to bring resolutions to companies have sprung up around the world. In the Netherlands, Follow This brought a resolution to Shell at its annual general meeting in May, calling for the oil and gas major to set more ""inspirational"" targets for cutting its emissions. While the motion did not pass, it attracted the support of nearly a third of shareholders more than double the amount from a similar vote the previous year. As You Sow, a US non-profit, petitioned Microsoft this summer calling for it to look at the environmental and social benefits of making its products easier to repair. Australian shareholder group ACCR filed resolutions at BHP, the mining group, over climate-related lobbying. In the UK, 100 shareholders need to file a resolution if they collectively hold less than 5 per cent of the company, meaning that retail investors are often key. Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, a registered charity that receives most of its funding from restricted grants, says: ""The role of the retail investor in all this is so crucial. There's literally nothing more impactful you can do if you're interested in investing."" Yet shareholder resolutions are far more common in the US than the UK, where only a handful of shareholder resolutions are filed each year. Companies tend to view them as damaging to their reputation and prefer to avoid them, Howarth believes. ""They really don't like such a visible expression from large institutional investors on disagreement with the board of management's position on something. Companies manage their reputation in the ESG space incredibly proactively at the moment."" Because of this, boards will often seek to resolve issues directly with shareholders, rather than allowing things to get to the resolution stage. Frequently this can have the same outcome. At HSBC, where David Gowenlock was involved, ShareAction withdrew its resolution this year after the bank promised to put forward its own proposal on curtailing lending to coal companies something the shareholders pushing for change had agreed in advance. Still, getting institutional investors involved in shareholder resolutions can be hard work, Howarth says. ""It's months of tiptoeing round trying to reassure them all, saying it hasn't come of the blue, but is after a long period of dialogue with the company."" The Investment Association, the UK asset management industry's trade body, says resolutions can be ""an important stewardship tool"" and expects they will become more common as climate change rises further up the agenda. But it believes that engaging with boards before taking things to the resolution level can often be very effective. One issue shareholders need to balance is requiring the board to take action but not telling them exactly what to do, which is not their role. And different shareholders may disagree on what constitutes a material long-term risk to a company. Certain large investors are more willing to get involved. LGIM, a large passive investor, has been stepping up its participation in shareholder resolutions both in the UK and the US, often teaming up with smaller shareholders. John Hoeppner, head of US stewardship and sustainable investments, says: ""Small shareholders filing resolutions is a growing trend."" However, he cautions that filing resolutions is time consuming. ""We try to pick them sparingly and use them strategically."" One problem for retail investor engagement, however, is that the vast majority remain uninvolved. Most do not vote at all on proposals at AGMs by the boards themselves, even when they concern executive pay, a topic which tends to stir emotions. Cliff Weight, a director at ShareSoc, which represents UK individual shareholders, says that despite owning 28.4 per cent of the UK stock market, ""it's almost impossible"" for retail investors to vote at AGMs. Often this is because they own their shares through investment platforms rather than directly, and investment platforms do not always make it straightforward for their clients to educate themselves. ""I think the industry should make it a hell of a lot easier,"" Weight says. ""It's a shocking abuse of democracy: we wouldn't allow it if 20 per cent of the country weren't allowed to vote in general elections."" A report last year from the Law Commission recognised this problem, noting that while so-called intermediated securities made trading a lot quicker and cheaper, they raised issues of transparency and corporate governance.    Because end investors, or ""ultimate"" investors, are not named on the shareholder register of companies they invest in, they must rely on their investment platform to help them to vote. One of the report's proposals is that intermediaries should be obliged to help retail investors exercise their voting rights. Interactive Investor, one of the largest investment platforms in the UK, recognises that it is not easy for retail investors to vote on their shares, and admits that a tiny proportion of them do. But, with an eye to keeping their customer base engaged and active, it is trying to encourage them to do more. Moira O'Neill, head of personal finance, says: ""The platform industry can do more to aid and empower their customers to lobby for change."" Since the start of this year it has encouraged customers to sign up for its free online voting service, with numbers opting to do so ""slowly creeping up"", she says, mostly among older clients. But the movement is in its early stages. ""With shareholder voting we're at the beginning of our journey. There's a lot of jargon that people who want to vote have to wade through."" For reform-minded investors such as Gowenlock it is worth the effort. ""Imagine if I called up HSBC as a customer and said: I want you to phase out coal,"" he says. ""I'm not going to have the slightest chance to make change. But when you hear that the campaign's been successful, that's an amazing feeling."" Alice Ross is deputy news editor of the FT.

4c5f06b271ed83f3261a,2021-10-22,Today's shortages are revenge of the 'old economy',"I t is tempting to blame today's shortages in the ""old economy"" everything from energy to other basic materials, and even agriculture on a series of temporary disruptions driven largely by Covid-19. But outside of a few labour issues, these bottlenecks have little to do with the pandemic. Instead, the roots of today's commodity crunch can be traced back to the aftermath of the financial crisis and the following decade of falling returns and chronic underinvestment in the old economy. As infrastructure aged and investment waned, so did the old economy's ability to supply and deliver the commodities underpinning many finished goods. After years of neglect, today's rising gas prices, copper supply shortfalls and China's struggles with power generation are the ""old economy's revenge"". In the economic stagnation following 2008, policymakers focused recovery efforts via central bank quantitative easing programmes to support markets. Lower income households faced sluggish real wage growth, economic insecurity, tighter credit limits and increasingly unaffordable assets. Higher income households, on the other hand, benefited from the financial asset inflation caused by QE. This disparity in outcomes hit the old economy hard. In the old economy, price appreciation results when the volume of demand outstrips the volume of supply. Higher income households may control the dollars but lower income households control the volume of commodity demand given their greater number and propensity to consume physical goods over services. As the volume of demand for commodities waned, so did the returns for old economy sectors. Lower returns led to less long-cycle old economy capital expenditure which traditionally requires a five to 10-year horizon of sufficient demand in favour of shortcycle ""new economy"" in investment in areas such as technology. By 2013, this weakness backed up into China. As the world's manufacturing engine slowed and commodities began their historic slide, the old economy's capital flight intensified. Indeed, the old economy was overbuilt, debt-laden and over-polluted. While the old economy only represents about 35 per cent of global gross domestic product, it generated at least 2 times the corporate losses, had about 90 per cent of the non-financial debt and created 80 per cent of the emissions. It is no wonder why investors preferred Big Tech to oil and copper. After the oil price collapsed in 2015, markets were fed up with wealth destruction, nearly halting deal flows across the old economy. China stopped aggressively stimulating lossmaking enterprises such as coal mines. And as climate change became top of mind, investors put greater weight on environmental, social and governance issues, further restricting capital. The resulting decline in investment prevented capacity growth in commodities. This has been particularly the case in hydrocarbons where divestiture by investors for ESG reasons compounded a growing under-investment problem.    The severity of these supply constraints has been underlined as countries have moved into recovery mode from the pandemic, exposing just how stretched the old economy has become. The pandemic also had a further effect, placing social needs more at the centre of policymakers' agendas. Such inclusive growth has only accentuated the demand for physical commodities. Shocks to one part of the system are now creating ripple effects elsewhere. Reduced coal output in China hit aluminium smelting capacity, creating shortages in aluminium. Reduced gas availability forced gas-to-oil substitution, generating shortages in oil. The rolling impact of smaller, frequent shocks on a stretched system generates the emergent phenomenon in which transitory shocks lead to persistent physical price inflation the start of which we are seeing today. This is where the revenge of the old economy will leave its mark. Periods of commodity price pressure will reoccur as broad-based demand meets inadequate infrastructure. If policymakers' goals of broad-based prosperity and a massive buildout in green infrastructure are to be met, commodity prices will need to significantly overshoot to the upside to provide the incentive for investment. This is needed to compensate for the growing risks involved in long-cycle capex projects and the inherent complexities surrounding the green energy transition. As we argued a year ago, a new commodity supercycle is upon us. Jeff Currie is global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs The roots of the commodity crunch can be traced back to chronic under-investment"
2cb7ed2532724e618d0e,2021-10-21,Flood peril threatens prices in $4tn US muni debt trade,"Fixed income. Local creditworthiness Default rate at risk of rising as cash-strapped cities struggle with extreme weather events About a quarter of all US infrastructure is at risk of serious flooding, new research shows, which could hit prices in the $4tn municipal bond market and jeopardise the creditworthiness of city and state issuers. New York-based climate research firm First Street Foundation last week published data showing that US infrastructure including roads, hospitals and power stations is at a greater risk of flooding than has previously been estimated. This has serious implications for state and city coffers, for property values, and for mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds. Louisiana, Florida and West Virginia have some of the worst flood prospects in the contiguous US, the First Street Foundation data show. In Louisiana, 45 per cent of all critical infrastructure facilities, a category that includes hospitals, fire stations, airports and power plants, are at risk of being rendered inoperable by flooding this year. Also at risk of shutdown are 39 per cent of roads and 44 per cent of social infrastructure schools, government buildings and houses of worship. In some cities in Louisiana, such as Metairie and New Orleans, the risk for those categories is nearly 100 per cent. Municipal debt has long been a haven asset class, popular with long-term investors including pension funds and insurance companies. While the default rate on muni bonds has historically been low, it could rise as cash-strapped cities struggle to keep up with extreme weather damage costs. Muni bonds also tend to have maturities between 15 and 30 years; the average muni maturity issued last month was 18.6 years, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. With the climate changing so quickly, that leaves a lot of time for disaster to strike. Investors also face the risk of geographic concentration. Owning munis issued by the state in which you live affords investors certain tax benefits, so muni investors tend to have high degrees of exposure to certain regions. A severe weather event could therefore quickly wipe out a huge amount of value in a muni portfolio. ""It is clear [climate] is a risk factor"" in the municipal debt market, said Peter DeGroot, head of municipal bond research at JPMorgan. ""The increasing frequency and intensity of weather events is a costly and complex issue for the federal government and for state and local governments as well.""    Flooding can affect municipal debt in various ways. There's the direct effect a muni bond issued to fund the construction of a hospital could fall in value or risk default if its revenue stream ends abruptly when the hospital is destroyed in a storm. Natural disasters can also drive people and businesses away and lower the value of existing property, diminishing a state or city's tax base, another way that muni bonds are paid off. Widespread flooding is also enormously expensive. Between 1980 and 2020, natural disasters caused $1.8tn worth of damage, according to the Government Accountability Office, roughly half of which was related to hurricanes and tropical storms. Municipalities have to borrow more in order to pay to rebuild, and to build new climate adaptation infrastructure, raising the credit risk of existing bonds as well as the cost to borrow new funds. Research led by Paul Goldsmith- Pinkham at Yale University shows that municipal bond markets have already begun to price in the risks of higher sea levels. The federal government has until now stepped in to help cities rebuild after major disasters. But as these events become more frequent, resources can be strained and local governments may bear more responsibility for funding recovery efforts. Of the top 10 states with the greatest infrastructure flood risk, two are also among the most indebted: Connecticut and New York. Connecticut has the highest net taxsupported debt per capita out of all 50 states, the second-highest net tax-supported debt as a percentage of personal income and the second-highest net taxsupported debt as a percentage of state gross domestic product, according to credit rating agency Moody's. New York is within the top 10 in each of those categories as well. There is anecdotal evidence of an overlap between indebted municipalities and those with high flood risk. Adding climate to a list of credit risks could exacerbate a difficult situation for these states and cities, making it even harder and costlier for them to borrow. One of the two municipal debt defaults in 2020 albeit not driven by climate costs was in New Orleans, the city with the second-highest flood risk in the country. In Stockton, California, one of the largest cities to declare bankruptcy, 75 per cent of critical infrastructure facilities and 94 per cent of its social infrastructure is at risk of flooding this year. ""With a lot of these climate risks, we might not want to buy a small city on the coast that has a high risk of flooding but we might be comfortable with owning a larger name with a better balance sheet for a shorter period because we have to think about how to actually price that calculated risk,"" said Alexa Gordon, a portfolio manager and head of muni ESG at Goldman Sachs. All three major US rating agencies Moody's, S&P and Fitch have begun to incorporate climate risk into their municipal debt evaluations. ""Our analytical view has been that flooding is akin to other risks that a state or local government could be challenged with,"" said Marcy Block, senior director of sustainable finance at Fitch Ratings. ""To the extent the risk of flooding becomes a credit risk as it's beyond management's ability to effectively control, that would be reflected in our ratings and our ESG relevance scores,"" she added. 'The increasing intensity of weather events is a costly and complex issue'"
69f5044d5b89a0a0dcce,2021-10-20,PwC agrees $2.2bn sale of mobility advisory unit to CD&R,"Financial services PwC has agreed to sell its global mobility services business to the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for about $2.2bn, in its biggest disposal for almost two decades. The unit, which advises companies on tax and immigration issues when they move staff overseas, operates in a market hit by the pandemic. The buyout group hopes the business is well placed to benefit from a rebound as travel restrictions ease. Peter Clarke, global managing partner for global employee mobility at PwC, will be the newly spun-off company's chief executive. Russ Fradin, former chief executive and chair of Aon Hewitt and a partner at the buyout group, will be its chair. ""The return of business travel, emerging mobile work patterns, and the heightened need for compliance in a complex business and regulatory environment will drive significant need"" for its services, Fradin said. The sale is the largest by PwC since it disposed of its consulting division to IBM for $3.5bn in 2002 as audit firms reacted to calls for greater independence in the wake of the Enron scandal. It later rebuilt its consulting practice. The company does not disclose revenue or profit figures for the global mobility business, which sits in its tax and legal division. CD&R also declined to provide the figures. PwC reported global revenues of $45.1bn for the year to June 2021 and employs 295,000 people. The sale is the latest in a string of disposals to private equity firms by PwC and its consulting rivals as they prioritise investment in fast-growing sectors such as technology and advising companies on environmental, social and governance matters. PwC, one of the Big Four consultants alongside Deloitte, EY and KPMG, offloaded its US government services division to Veritas Capital in 2018. It sold fintech business eBam, now called LikeZero, in December and used the proceeds to hand UK partners a record average payout of £868,000 for the year to June. Deloitte and KPMG have both sold their UK insolvency businesses in private equity-backed deals this year to head off pressure over conflicts of interest. Some of the Big Four's star partners have also calculated that they will be able to earn more elsewhere as they will not have to share their earnings with other less profitable parts of the firms, according to people in the industry. PwC's global mobility business, which operates in about 40 territories worldwide, would be rebranded after the transaction completed, CD&R said. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2022, it added. Bob Moritz, PwC's global chair, said the transaction would allow increased investment in line with the group's strategy. PwC plans to spend $12bn over five years as it focuses on advising clients on technology and ESG matters.

e74711b4bdaf9b8ba87d,2021-10-20,Stock market indices cannot be murky,"Discretion may have a role in forming benchmarks, but clarity is vital Of the many changes wrought by the global financial crisis in 2008, one of the largest has been the huge shift away from active asset management and towards passive, index-tracking funds. The indices that these funds follow have in turn gained enormous power, becoming gatekeepers to the flow of trillions of dollars. Names like S&P Dow Jones, FTSE Russell and MSCI are formidable brands in their own right, earning record revenues from charging funds licensing fees. The Financial Times itself has recently re-entered the index business, through a partnership with Wilshire, 10 years after selling its stake in FTSE to the London Stock Exchange. Nikkei, which owns the FT, compiles its own index of companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. But a scandal that questions the integrity of the provider of one of the most commonly followed indices has outsized implications for investors big and small. A working paper recently published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that companies that bought credit ratings from S&P Global's rating business were statistically more likely to be included in the S&P 500, the benchmark index of US blue-chips run by another S&P subsidiary. S&P argues that the paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, is ""flawed"" and misleading about the index's eligibility rules and methodology. S&P also insists that it has a strict separation of business lines. To be sure, some of the paper's claims may seem overdone, given that S&P is a major player in both the credit rating and index-provision business. A company may naturally seek a credit rating to assist in its expansion efforts that would in any case propel it into the index. But accusations of conflicts and payto-play in indices are particularly problematic for S&P, whose ratings business was tarred with similar allegations during the financial crisis, along with other major credit rating agencies. S&P paid $1.4bn to settle with the US justice department in 2015 after being accused of inflating the ratings it gave. Pay-to-play allegations would have no traction if indices operated in a formulaic fashion. While it may be well known that the S&P 500 is not an index of the 500 biggest stocks listed in America rather, of ""leading companies from leading industries"" just how much discretion is allowed in the process is perhaps the most thorny problem that the paper highlights, which now ought to be addressed. S&P has argued that discretion allows it to retain a balance of sectors, as well as the element of surprise, which impedes hedge funds from frontrunning decisions around new members. S&P also points to the case of AIG, the insurance behemoth bailed out by the US government in 2008. AIG should have then left the index but S&P has claimed retaining the insurer's membership headed off more panic. S&P allows more subjective judgment than other indices. The paper found that S&P eligibility criteria alone only explained 62 per cent of index composition between 1980 and 2018, and just 3 per cent of new additions. That leaves a lot of money chasing a committee's view of what constitutes the ""right"" composition of its index. Allegations of capture, either by industry or politics, are almost inevitable. Transparency is key as questions over the composition of indices become more pertinent. This will be particularly true in areas of growing importance, such as ESG investing. It may be impossible to remove the element of    judgment entirely. If that is the case, it is important that index providers are not discretionally transparent, but rather transparently discretional."
045b48309fe721143788,2021-10-20,Discipline is needed in the shift to net zero,"A wall of money is driving equity valuations to record highs across broad markets, spurred by pandemic stimulus programmes and low interest rates. Stocks targeted by investors for environmental, social and governance reasons have been particular beneficiaries from the deluge. The pool of assets under management with an ESG mandate is expected to rise to $50tn by 2025, from $35tn last year, according to a survey by Bloomberg Intelligence. High volumes of capital pursuing environmental initiatives in itself is not a risk but big fund flows without traditional investment rigour and discipline can damage financial markets by creating price bubbles, and undermine efforts to achieve net zero emissions and a low-carbon future. In particular, with pressure to invest into the ""clean energy"" asset class comes the risk that capital is misallocated, as investors prioritise urgent societal imperatives and optics over pure business nous and discipline. This approach of ""demonstration investments"" to back environmental causes may be justified in the short term but can be counterproductive in the long term, for several reasons. First, large, undisciplined financial flows into renewables can lead to mispricing, by inflating the price of assets so the market loses sight of what fair value is. This distortion in company valuations in turn affects how companies in the sector issue debt and equity, pay dividends, reinvest and pay employees. It can also harm mergers and acquisitions as it increases the risk that companies overpay in transactions. Already, anecdotal evidence indicates that start-ups at the early fundraising stages are being valued with multiples as high as 15 times revenues. The listed companies that the Renewable Energy Producers Exchange Trades Fund has invested in are valued, including debt, at a steep average multiple of 17 times their reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to advisory firm Finerva. And just as the market is placing a substantial premium on ""renewable"" assets, it is also aggressively discounting traditional energy sources. Of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, only energy and utilities have not yet recovered to prepandemic levels. The US energy sector is trading on a price equivalent to about 13 times the consensus forecast earnings for it over the next 12 months, compared with about 20 times for the broader S&P 500 index members. This perhaps explains why the energy sector represents just 2.3 per cent of the S&P 500 today, down from 11.3 per cent in 2007. The trend in part reflects how larger investors such as university endowments and pension funds are exiting these investments in part to demonstrate their green credentials to their stakeholders. In essence, new patterns of investment flows are buttressed by a new market doctrine that ""everything renewable is great and everything fossil-fuel-related is awful"". As a consequence, disinvestment in conventional energy companies and assets could lower investment in the global energy supply, create shortages and drive inflation    up. Essentially, this would worsen living standards and add to the estimated 1bn people who already live in energy poverty. The surfeit of money can also (inadvertently) hold back innovation, as many investors are neither willing nor incentivised to allocate capital to more innovative areas that would enhance existing energy sources such as carbon capture. Innovation is vital if the world is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and part of it should be to enhance the sustainability of existing fossil fuels. After all, fossil fuels will remain a key component of the global energy equation over the next three decades. According to the IEA, for example, even under its most aggressive energy transition scenario to reach net zero by 2050, fossil fuels will still contribute 20 per cent of global energy in 2050, compared with about 80 per cent today. In financial terms, if demonstration capital flows continue at pace there is the real prospect of the ESG bubble bursting in much the same way that we have seen similar episodes end in technology and property markets. Ultimately, a successful clean energy transition is one that is cost effective and affordable to all.

Other factors include a rise in the alumni pre-EMBA work experience rank from 11th to fifth. Alumni praised the leadership training and lectures by professors with international experience. There are opportunities to take part in courses with elite military forces, which one surveyed alumnus described as ""extraordinarily rich and moving"". TATJANA MITEVSKA Highest salary Kellogg/HKUST The Kellogg/HKUST EMBA, taught in Hong Kong, lost the top spot but is joint second. As in previous years, the programme's alumni have the highest average salary three years after completing their studies, at $508,964. The EMBA also received positive feedback for the career and networking opportunities it offered. ""All the knowledge I learnt from the EMBA has increased my influence not only in my company but also the whole industry,"" said one graduate. LEO CREMONEZI FT EMBA ranking tiers l-lV and table notes (for methodology see page 27) All the EMBAs in the ranking are of high quality. Some 196 points separate the top programme, at HEC Paris, from the school ranked 100. The schools are divided into four tiers. Those in tiers l and ll score above the average for the cohort, and tiers lll and lV are below it. The difference in scores between schools ranked consecutively is greater within tiers l and lV than in tiers ll and lll. Tier l includes 13 schools, from HEC Paris to Fudan University School of Management. Tier ll runs from IE Business School, ranked 14, to University of Toronto: Rotman at 43. Tier lll, headed by IBS-Moscow Ranepa, spans schools ranked 44 to 82. Tier lV includes schools from Frankfurt School of Finance and Management at 83 to Sabanci Business School at 100. * Programme not fully available in English. ** Data in this column are for information only and are not used in the rankings. The ESG rank may not be representative of some EMBAs due to the factors listed below. No data available. School did not have student enrolments during the specified time frame from July 2020 to July 2021, due to the pandemic. This also means the school was unable to provide the number of teaching hours devoted to ESG for the core courses for its recent class. § No ESG data available for MIT: Sloan's current and completing classes and for Emory's current class.

FT RANKING TIER: schools are divided into four groups, from tier one to four. Includes data for the current year and the one or two preceding years where available. For the three gender-related criteria, schools that have 50:50 (male: female) composition receive the highest possible score. FT Executive MBA 2021 Methodology (continued on p29) This is the 21st edition of the FT's annual ranking of the world's top 100 executive MBA programmes for senior working managers. Participation in the ranking is voluntary and at the business school's request. EMBA programmes must meet certain criteria to be eligible. First, the school must be accredited by either the US Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business or Europe's Equis. The EMBA must be cohort-based, with students enrolling and graduating together, and with at least 30 graduates each year. A total of 136 programmes took part in the 2021 ranking process, including 14 joint programmes delivered by more than one school. Two new schools feature in our table Moscow's Skolkovo at 58 and Zhejiang at 65. Data for the ranking are collected using two online surveys, the first completed by participating schools and the second by alumni who completed programmes in 2018. Normally, for a school to be eligible for the rankings, at least 20 per cent of its alumni must respond to the FT survey, with a minimum of 20 responses. Due to the Covid-19 crisis, this year the FT considered schools with a lower response rate. A total of 4,770 alumni completed the survey an overall response rate of around 47 per cent. Alumni responses inform five ranking criteria: salary today, salary increase, career progress, work experience and aims achieved. Together they account for 55 per cent of the ranking's weight. The first two criteria about alumni salaries each count for 20 per cent. Biggest riser Neoma Business School The French school Neoma rose furthest, climbing 16 places to joint 70th. Its EMBA is taught in France, China and Iran. The improvement is a result of better alumni career progress and their level of pre- EMBA work experience. The school's research rank also rose, a category based on the volume of research published in 50 selected journals. Alumni commended the school on its ability to improve their confidence and networks. SS Highest new entrant Moscow School of Management Skolkovo The highest new entrant is Russia's Moscow School of Management Skolkovo, at 58. The school has a high international course experience rank (37th), based on the number of teaching hours overseas. Alumni have gone on to earn high salaries, with its average of $394,252 in the top 10 of all ranked schools. Surveyed graduates reported Skolkovo offers high-quality teaching that helps students progress in their career. SS PHOTOS: ALAMY Back in the top 10 EMBA-Global: Columbia/ London Business School The EMBA from Columbia, in New York, and LBS, returns to the top 10 in eighth place. Alumni praised good teaching from a variety of experts. One alumnus said it had ""given me the confidence to network with people I    would normally consider out of my reach and equipped me with an understanding of generalist management topics that I would otherwise not learn through the course of my career"". WAI KWEN CHAN FT Executive MBA 2021 Methodology (continued from p27) Salaries of non-profit and public-sector workers, as well as full-time students, are removed. Remaining salaries are converted to US dollars using the latest purchasing power parity (PPP) rates supplied by the IMF. The highest and lowest salaries are then removed and the mean average ""current salary"" is calculated for each school. Salary increase is calculated according to the difference in average salary before the EMBA to three years after completion. Half of the ranking weight is applied to the absolute increase and the other half to the percentage increase relative to pre-EMBA pay. When available, alumni criteria are informed by the past three surveys. Responses from the 2021 survey carry 50 per cent of the total weight and those from 2020 and 2019 each account for 25 per cent. Excluding salary-related criteria, if only two years of data are available, the weighting is split 60:40 if data are from 2021 and 2020, or 70:30 if from 2021 and 2019. For salary figures, the weighting is 50:50 for two years' data, to avoid inflation-related distortions. Information provided by the business schools informs 10 criteria that collectively account for 35 per cent of the final ranking. The ESG category is based on the proportion of core courses dedicated to environmental, social and governance issues. It carries a weight of 3 per cent. The weight of faculty and student gender diversity is 4 per cent each. For these gender diversity criteria, schools with a 50:50 (male: female) composition receive the highest score. The international diversity calculation is based on the overall percentage of students and faculty from abroad as well as the spread of these individuals by citizenship based on the Herfindahl index, a measure of concentration. The final criterion, the FT research rank, accounts for 10 per cent of the ranking. It is calculated according to the number of articles published by schools' full-time faculty in 50 internationally recognised academic and practitioner journals. The rank combines the absolute number of publications from January 2018 to May 2021 with the number of publications weighted relative to the faculty's size. The FT rankings are relative. Schools are ranked against each other rather than against set standards. The FT calculates the Z-scores for each criterion. (Z-scores show how far a school's data is from the mean and are unitless, so they allow the ranking to be based on very different criteria salary, percentages and points.) These scores are then weighted as outlined in the ranking key and added together for a final score. After removing the schools that did not meet the minimum response rate from their alumni, a first version is calculated using all remaining schools. The school at the bottom is removed and a second version is calculated. This action is repeated to find the top 100. Judith Pizer of Pizer-MacMillan acted as the FT's database consultant. The FT research rank was calculated using Clarivate data covering 50 journals selected by FT from the Web of Science, an abstract and citation database of research literature."
35016db5187f94ab1750,2021-10-18,Boards feel pressure from shareholder petitions,"Governance Asset managers are ever more willing to back activist investors, says Patrick Temple-West After an unprecedented year of investor support for environmental, social and governance (ESG) petitions at companies worldwide, board members are bracing themselves for more pressure in the months ahead. A record 12 proposals on environmental issues filed at US companies in 2021 were passed with a majority of shareholder support, according to law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, which has analysed voting patterns in annual general meetings. And data provider Morningstar has calculated that the average level of shareholder support for all environmental and social petitions increased to a record 34 per cent in the 12 months to July 2021. Diversity, equity and inclusion resolutions won an average of 43 per cent backing and nine petitions passed. But perhaps the most notable example of shareholder activism this year was at ExxonMobil, where a small hedge fund investor succeeded in having three new members voted on to the oil major's board. The support given to such a small stakeholder in Exxon underscored the vulnerability of boards that are not seen as taking ESG concerns seriously enough. For the environmentalists and religious organisations that traditionally file shareholder proposals, these successes mark a dramatic shift in fortunes from even just a couple of years ago. For decades, activists struggled to win any significant support for their causes. The largest asset managers — BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard — rarely sided with them, allowing companies to shrug off ESG concerns. But the big asset managers are no longer asleep. Vanguard's support for environmental and social proposals put before boards by shareholders jumped to 20 per cent in January-June this year, from 6 per cent for the same period in 2020, the firm said in September. Its support for workforce diversity proposals — asking companies to disclose more information about their gender and racial composition — shot up to 50 per cent from 17 per cent the year before. Meanwhile, rival BlackRock says that it doubled its support for shareholder proposals in 2020-21 compared with the previous year. Italso recently announced that it willallow big institutional clients tovote directly at AGMs, potentiallyincreasing the constituency thatboards must answer to. Investors also revolted against bigbonuses for executives. A record number of ""say-on-pay"" votes —non-binding votes on executive paymandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frankfinancial regulations — went against the companies in 2021, according to ISS Corporate solutions . The last few months of the year are typically a time when companies and investors talk through shareholder concerns before petitions are filed. Now, following record support for ESG proposals, companies seem more accommodating towards activist investors, worried that a proposal could lead to an adverse vote and a reputational hit. Companies that take a flippant approach to investors' ESG concerns are 'a dying breed'"", says one lawyer familiar with such boardroom discussions, who requestedanonymity to speak freely. These days, boards are meeting totalk about their climate strategy andhow to roll out a net zero emissionsplan that does not come across asgreenwashing, the lawyer adds. Companies are also hiring specialists to check    asset manager's voting records to see where pre-emptive shareholder reassurance may be needed. ""Forward-thinking companies have been preparing for these continued discussions by putting together better and more disclosure,"" says Marc Treviño, co-head of Sullivan & Cromwell's corporate governance practice. ""As they did in 2021, I expect that companies will continue to prefer to negotiate the withdrawal of climate-related shareholder proposals as opposed to risk being seen as anti-climate by investors and other stakeholders."" Engaging with investors before a potentially damaging vote ""will be the number-one issue of the 2022 season,"" he suggests. As You Sow, a California-based non-profit that is one of the largest filers of shareholder proposals on behalf of endowments and other investors, says a record five of its petitions won majority support in 2021.But it prefers to engage with compa"",nies before any petition is filed. Thaim is to get managers to makechange's without having to go to ashareholder vote. ""Ultimately, we help these companies reduce risk and improve theirbrand,"" says Andrew Behar, As YouSow's chief executive. ""Lookingahead, the question now is how companies will implement changes totheir policies and practices inresponse to these high votes, and howinvestors respond if they don't."" The big asset managers have historically been reluctant to defy companymanagers on ESG proposals. But theseinvestors have felt pressure themselves from the world's largest pension funds to prioritise ESGconcerns.Neuberger Berman, an asset manager overseeing about $429bn, has taken a novel approach by disclosinghow it will vote on some shareholderproposals before the vote takes place.Most asset managers do not disclosetheir votes until afterwards. But Neuberger's pre-vote disclosure, whichstarted in 2020, aims to driveprogress on environmental and .social matters, the firm has said. ""We are increasingly hearing froour clients that they want more transparency around proxy voting overall,"" says Caitlin McSherry, director ofinvestment stewardship at Neuberger Berman. She adds that companies are now getting in touch with thefirm proactively to ward off potentialinvestor discontent. ""I see it escalating this fall,"" she says. Companies that take a flippant approach to investors' ESG concerns are 'a dying breed'"
11e5da979bb6f5ac65cc,2021-10-18,Regulators place branding under the microscope,"Marketing Finance watchdogs are cracking down on greenwashing, says Mariana Lemann Can you have too much of a good thing? For regulatorslooking at the recent proliferation of funds sold with an environmental, social and governance stamp, the answer may be ""yes"". Fund managers. who cannot substantiate ESG branding had better beware. According to data provider Morningstar , the numberof ""sustainable"" — that is, ESGfocused — open-ended and exchange traded funds in the US increased last year by 30 per cent, to 392. They attracted a record $51.1bn of net inflows, more than twice the amount in 2019, "".with investors drawn not justby ethical and environmentalconcerns but also by the prospect of good returns. Over the three years to the end of 2020, 75 per cent of ESG funds ranked in the top half of their fund category for performance, Morningstar says. Reluctant to miss out on this —bonanza, managers of some long-established funds have repurposed them for the ESG era, adopting new investment strategies and ESG-signalling names. Morningstar says 69 have done so since 2013 — 25 in2020 alone, of which the two biggest were Invesco Floating rate, now Invesco Floating Rate ESG, and USAA World Growth, now USAA Sustainable World. ""I am sure that some folks, because ESG and responsible investing are sometimes hard to define have taken advantage of the marketing opportunities that having aneSG or sustainability labelwould have afforded them,""says Meredith Jones, a partner""and global head of ESG at professional services firm Aon.This surge in ESG brandinghas attracted the attention ofthe Securities and ExchangeCommission, the US financialregulator, which has indicated that it will not tolerate""greenwashing"" — the practice of embellishing or misrepresenting an investment product's ESG characteristics. Addressing his organisation's asset management advisory committee in July, SEC chair Gary Gensler said: ""we've seen a growing number of funds marketing themselves as 'green', 'sustainable', 'lowcarbon' and so on"" — and noted that ""there's not a standardised meaning of these sustainability-related terms"". He said SEC staff were considering asking managers to disclose the criteria they use in making such claims, as well as reviewing the policy on fund naming conventions. ""If a fund's name suggests a certain investment focus, investorsexpect investment in that area,"" Gensler stated. Regulators elsewhere are"" tightening up ESG disclosurestandards. In Europe, the Sustainable Finance DisclosureRegulation, effective sinceMarch, requires asset managers to use a uniform set ofreporting standards in disclosing the impact their portfolioshave on people and the planet. The growing regulatory and reputational risk in sustainable finance was illustrated in August, when DWS, Deutsche "" Bank's asset managementarm, became embroiled in arow about its ESG claims. Following allegations by DesireeFixler, DWS's former head ofsustainability, that it had misrepresented the rigour of itsESG processes, both the SECand BaFin, the German financial regulator, launched investigations into the firm.    DWS says it rejects Fixler'sallegations, and insists that ithas ""always been clear"" in itsESG reporting. The furore erupted weeksafter not just Gensler'sremarks, but also a DWSannouncement that nine of itsETFs would be renamed toinclude the ESG tag. DWS's travails have sentshockwaves through the ESGsector. As managers try to predict precisely how the SEC willapproach their investment""products, compliance expertsadvise detailed risk disclosures and caution in makingsustainability-related claims. ""ESG isn't really new any more, but in the broader picture it is a new area in terms of compliance and enforcement',"" says Jason Ewasko, chief compliance officer at Cipperman Compliance Services. ""I would recommend caution for any firms that are looking to slap ESG on to a strategy or a model or a portfolio,"" he adds. ""It's clear to anybody who's half awake that the SEC is scrutinising this."" The regulator's initial steps may include requiring firms that use ESG-related fund— names to justify them throughdetailed reporting and standardised disclosures of the risksinherent in .such products. ""We anticipate, with the current administration, that therewill be more guidance,"" saysAnthony Eames, director ofresponsible investment strategy at Calvert Research Management. ""I think managersare going to have to be able toprove that, if ESG is integrated,how it is integrated."" managers. also expect regulators to be mindful of the policiesemerging among their overseascounterparts. ""One of the questions that the SEC has right now for assetmanagers [is] how we seethings in a global context,"" saysJens Peers, CEO and chiefinvestment officer at asset manager Mirova US. ""The industry wants to avoid having different rules indifferent parts of the world,""he adds. ""At this stage, I see noevidence of regulators co-ordi"" nating policies, but I'm surethey keep a close eye on developments in other countries.""

e111c8f0f08c1d7b0730,2021-10-18,How to handle the ESG laggards,"Sin stocks Does it pay to shun sectors such as oil? Clear-cut evidence is elusive, writes Brooke Masters Shunning is a powerful social control mechanism. It is no wonder, therefore, that activists often seek to employ it in a financial context. The 1980s divestment movement that lobbied university endowments and companies to pull out of apartheid-era South Africa set the pattern for further efforts, which have at times targeted tobacco, weapons and gambling, among others. These days, the exclusion movement is focusing on fossil fuel producers and companies that fall foul of environmental, social and governance standards. Advocates of this strategy make a two pronged-argument. First, they contend that companies scoring well on ESG metrics will outperform and, second, they say starving companies of capital if they ignore such concerns will push them to change their business practices. How realistic is this? A New York University review of more than 1,000 recent studies looking at ESG metrics and financial performance offers support for the first contention. Some 58 per cent of studies found a positive correlation between ESG measures and corporate financial performance, while 33 per cent of studies identified a positive correlation between ESG and the investment performance of related funds, portfolios and indices. In addition, stocks in ESG indices have tended to provide downside protection during sell-offs — for example, during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. But some index experts, such as Alain Dubois, formerly of MSCI and Lyxor Asset Management, think this is a short-term fad driven by a period of low oil and gas prices and by inflows from institutions driven by posturing. ""The whole thing is messy and very opportunistic,"" he says. ""My personal view is don't invest in anything like that and, at some point, it will be a good idea to buy unsustainable stocks that are discarded by the 'look good' institutions."" His view is partly supported by research from index provider Scientific Beta, which calculated that ESG stocks do better when the media and investors are paying more attention to them (as measured by inflows into ESG funds). It also found that much of the outperformance can be explained by the fact that many green companies are higher risk. The history of more traditional ""sin stocks"" such as tobacco, gambling and firearms companies offers mixed evidence. Research done in the 2000s suggested that, rather than lagging behind the broader stock market, sin stocks outperformed it. One global study led by Frank Fabozzi of Edhec Business School even argued that ""an economic gain might accrue for not conforming to social standards"". However, he and David Blitz of asset manager Robeco re-examined this contention more recently. They found that the outperformance of sin stocks was largely explained by their predictable returns, regular dividends and high profitability. When compared with other companies that had a similar profile, the premium went away. Taken together, the research on sin stocks and ESG investing suggests that shunning sin stocks or ""brown"" companies (those in pollution-prone or carbon-intensive industries) is not a certain route to improved returns. But it is also not clear that following one's principles means having to accept reduced performance.    Hortense Bioy of Morningstar, the data provider, argues that focusing just on exclusions is misleading because ESG funds don't necessarily omit entire sectors. For example, there are nearly 500 US open-ended and exchange traded funds that identify themselves as sustainable, and Morningstar calculates that at least 77 per cent of them have at least some revenue from fossil fuels. ""In theory, exclusions free up capital depending on where you put your money, that could change your returns,"" she points out . If the evidence on share price performance is a mixed bag, what about the idea that ESG investing can help persuade unsustainable companies to change their business models? BP is an example of a company trying to do just that. Chief executive Bernard Looney pledged last year to cut oil and gas production by 40 per cent , by 2030. ""All oil companies are not the same. Let us go solve the problem,"" he says. ""If it's really hard, even better. We can make a lot of money solving it and make the world better at the same time."" Yet BP's shares have failed to outpace those of oil groups that have not moved to decarbonise as quickly. And there is little evidence that ESG bad guys are being starved for investment . Another study by Robeco's Blitz found no evidence that unsustainable groups attracted less capital than those with the greenest of labels in the 2010s. Even today, the popular fund family SPDR's standards &P 500 ETF has a market capitalisation of $384bn, while the fossil fuel-free version has just $1.2bn and the ESG version has $336m. Equity funds may not be the right place to look, though. As the sin stock studies show, some investors are always willing to leap in if they think shares are underpriced. The real sustainability challenge could come from another Source. Right now, many companies are relying on borrowing not just for investment but also for the share buybacks that keep investors happy. The Rainforest Action Network has calculated that the world's 60 largest banks provided $3.8tn in fossil fuel financing between 2016 and 2020. However, some banks and debt investors have begun talking up their sustainability credentials, and banking "" Regulators are starting toinclude climate impacts in their stress tests. If that prompts the financial services industry to shy away from bankrolling ""brown"" companies and those that ignore social and governance expectations, the pressure will be much more intense. ESG outperformance can be explained by the fact that many green companies are higher risk"
e1a0ca3fa4577ad7fb98,2021-10-18,"Good for the planet, bad for human rights?","China Hudson Lockett and Thomas Hale assess the country's appeal to ESG investors One year ago, the Chinese government — having shaken off the initial blow from a pandemic that originated within its borders — made a pledge that resonated around the world. ""Mankind should no longer ignore the repeated warnings of nature,"" said Xi Jinping, the president of China, at a UN event. as he committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2060. ""We have to quickly form a green way of development and life."" For the burgeoning field of sustainable investing, with its focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, the announcement underlined the opportunities afforded by China's transition from the world's biggest consumer and producer of coal — a prime source of the carbon dioxide that drives climate change — to an economy that makes greater use of alternative energy sources. But ESG veterans in China say that is only part of the story. Investors used to high levels of transparency from listed companies in Europe and the US face a daunting lack of information on Chinese businesses, which often see little upside in radical openness on their environmental impacts — and even less in disclosing social and governance practices that may differ from western norms. ""The question is are there really true ESG investment opportunities and are they going to give the investment return that investors want?"" says the longtime China head of a US non-profit body that is developing Chinese ESG standards. ""There's a lot of money that wants to go in that direction but there's not enough detail."" The overall sustainable investing industry shows signs of growth in the region. In 2018, Adrien Zuercher, the Hong Kong-based head of global asset allocation and coall, head of global investment management for Asia-Pacific at Swiss bank UBS, launched a sustainable impact portfolio that has now raised $30bn globally. He points to the Chinese government's promise to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2060, which has ""thrust this ambitious decarbonisation programme into the international limelight"". ""These are good investment opportunities and Chinese clients are interested in these topics,"" he says. ""But I would say they regard sustainable and impact investing more as an investment opportunity and, maybe to a small extent, as an investment philosophy."" Jackie Choy, Asia director for ETF research at data provider Morningstar, says that while her firm has identified China as one of the largest markets for sustainable investment outside the US and Europe, ""on a deeper level, it's not really full-on ESG like we're seeing for example in Europe"". Global investors have chosen mainly environment-focused investments in China, Choy says, thanks to the clear signals from Beijing that reduction of pollution and carbon emissions will remain a priority for policymakers in the coming decades.    Yet recent power shortages have shown that keeping the lights on is a more pressing priority, with calls from the government to expand coal production to meet the demand for electricity. And even high-profile drives to improve ESG standards in China can face serious reversals, particularly when growth slows. Bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen were scheduled to require all listed companies to disclose environmental information for the first time in 2020, but officials quietly delayed those plans when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Mandatory disclosures are still expected at some point, but their absence makes it harder for investors with an ESG mandate to justify increasing their exposure to Chinese securities. ""Look at a normal global [benchmark] index versus the ESG version of that index — the China portion will be smaller in the ESG version,"" Choy says. While the past year ushered in new climate commitments, it also brought extreme regulatory changes in China as the government increased its control over sectors ranging from technology to education, sparking volatility in stock markets. That shift has recently spurred a debate on whether to invest in China at with George Soros among those criticising US firms expanding within the country. But, for ESG investors specifically, the criticisms are more acute. Helena Morrissey, chair of investment platform AJ Bell, said at an event at the UK Conservative party's conference earlier this month that ""appeasement"" of China ""cannot be reconciled with ESG principles, with socially responsible investing, with upholding democracy"". Human rights groups — such as Hong Kong Watch, which organised that event — have criticised China for abuses including its mass internment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang province and its crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong. Noting that trouble in China's ""over-indebted property sector [has got] people thinking about what they're doing with their money"" — a reference to the debt crisis at developer Evergrande — Morrissey said that ""if ESG is to mean anything, it must surely start with human rights, not ignore or downplay them"". However, continued inflows to Chinese stocks and bonds from global investors suggest those calling for divestment have an uphill battle. And some investors with more flexible ESG mandates may be willing to forgo disclosures seen as vital in other jurisdictions if returns are attractive. In a report earlier this year, the consultancy Willis Towers Watson argued that, for global investors, ""the investment case still holds for allocation to China after the environmental, social and governance characteristics of its assets are properly taken into account"". But it stopped well short of suggesting a blanket allocation to Chinese assets, recommending ""skilled active management"" to reduce risks — a nod to the limited disclosure that ESG pushes up against in a market teeming with opportunity for investors less concerned about companies' broader impacts. ""There are real human rights abuses, 100 per cent,"" says the China head of the US non-profit body, while also pointing to a proliferation of young Chinese experts in green finance. ""This is the dilemma for China we have to embrace that there's Xinjiang, and other, [positive] things, and engage on both."" 'If ESG is to mean anything, it must surely start with human rights, not ignore them'"
b0874bc1958b20b71bc4,2021-10-18,Does crypto have any place in an ESG portfolio?,"Technology Bitcoin is dubious, blockchain is better, says Eva Szalay Doug Miller is a staunch believer in the power of technology to solve environmental problems. As a masters student at London's Imperial College, the American orchestrated a field study of office workers and energy consumption. He found that automating light switches was more effective and cheaper than relying on the last person leaving a room to turn off the lights. In his current role at global non-profit organisation Energy Web, he has gone even more high-tech: engineering a certification system for digital assets that rely on clean energy. ""I come at this purely from an environmental point of view,"" he says. ""Blockchain forms a key part of the clean energy transition."" But asset managers with an environmental, social and governance brief may think differently. Blockchain is best known as the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin — assets whose carbon footprint and utility in illicit transactions put them beyond the ESG pale. That may change, however, as — thanks to the efforts of Miller and others — blockchain percolates into more areas of the economy. Cryptocurrencies owe their dubious environmental reputation to the huge amounts of electricity, often coal-generated, that computers need to create them. And because they are not subject to government regulation, they area favoured medium of exchange for criminals and terrorists: the hackers who closed down Colonial Pipeline in the US in May, for example, received their ransom in bitcoin. European asset manager Candriam said earlier this year that ""cryptocurrencies have a long way to go to satisfy ESG criteria"", citing money laundering and the environmental impact of ""mining"" coins (performing the complex calculations that generate them). Yet Miller is at pains to emphasise the difference between speculative currencies and the technology that supports not only them but other, more innocuous digital assets — such as the supposedly tout-proof tickets sold for the 2018 football World Cup. Central banks are also using the technology. ""There is a risk of conflating blockchain technology and crypto,"" he says. ""Helping energy companies manage their grid better is very different from [cryptocurrency] Dogecoin."" Energy Web runs just such a grid project with an Australian electricity group. Last month, UBS Wealth Management said that, as well as healthcare and sustainability, ""the digital transformation of sectors ranging from transport to manufacturing and financial services creates opportunities"". In a paper evaluating cryptocurrency investments, the wealth manager's analysts recommended that ""investors focus on companies exposed to the evolution of distributed ledger technology, rather than engaging directly in cryptos"". Distributed ledgers — of which blockchain is one type — are systems that rely on the collective agreement of users to verify transactions.    More recently, the Technology has evolved in a way that cuts down on the number of users needed to approve transactions., making these systems more energy efficient. A recent study by University College London found that some new 'Distributed ledger technologies — using the so-called ""proof-of-stake"" protocol rather than the older ""proofof-work"" method — were up to three times more efficient than earlier systems . ""Our work shows that [newer blockchains] could even undercut the energy needs of traditional central payment systems, raising hopes that 'Distributed ledger technologies can contribute positively to combating climate change',"" the paper concluded. Further impetus may come from the Crypto Climate Accord, which aims to decarbonise the crypto industry by 2030 (and which Miller played a key part in founding). Crypto diehards also point to the fact that the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining is falling, especially since China this year banned privat ""cryptocurrencies and shut down huge mining operations. The impact is already showing up in data. In May, the Cambridge Bitcoin. Electricity Consumption Index estimated that bitcoin's global electricity consumption was about the same as Sweden's. This month, it is on a par with Kyrgyzstan's — a significantly lower level. And conventional assets have issues of their own. ""It could be argued that there is a much bigger but more subtle problem with fiat money as it pertains to the environment,"" say analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent report. Central bank-backed currencies, they argue, are ""the ultimate tool in bringing forward consumption from tomorrow to today"", referring to national policymakers' ability to print money through quantitative easing. Still, there are significant risks around cryptocurrencies, especially for responsible investors. The use of digital coins in illicit activities remains rife. Chainalysis, a crypto monitoring company, says bitcoin remains attractive for criminals ""due to its pseudonymous nature and the ease with which it allows users to instantly send funds anywhere in the world, despite its transparent and traceable design"". Nevertheless, there are some hopeful signs for crypto fans. Chainalysis found that, in 2019, around $21.4bn worth of transfers were due to illicit activity, representing 2.1 per cent of all cryptocurrency transactions. Last year, such activities had fallen to about $10bn worth of transactions., or 0.34 per cent of the total. Many continue to believe that, ultimately, cryptocurrencies will fade out after crashing and burning, due to their speculative nature and lack of inherent value. Regulation and central bank digital currencies are also threats. ""Bitcoin is a video game,"" Jan Kregel, an economist and director of research at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in New York tells the FT. ""There is potential for the crypto world to blow up and cause a bigger crisis than subprime."" The Technology behind it, however, is probably here to stay.

0c83ff67689afa34e336,2021-10-18,Bond funds face rights dilemma,"Ethics Does divesting from oppressive countries do more harm than good? By Laurence Fletcher It is easy to pay lip service to human rights: investment firms' promotional material abounds with references to them. It is far harder to work out how investors can best advance those rights. Yet this is a task that bond fund managers must increasingly wrestle with, as activists call them out on their rhetoric. A Financial Times investigation in July found that several fund management firms that claimed to care about human rights were lending to countries that violated those rights. There was often scant evidence of human rights even being touched on when firms spoke to sovereign debt issuers. The FT also found that 34 per cent of bonds in a JPMorgan emerging market bond index that used environmental, social and governance (ESG) scoring were issued by countries rated ""not free"" by democracy campaign group Freedom House. Divestment may seem an obvious response, but some experts question its effectiveness as a means of changing a country's behaviour. ""It may be heretical to say so when ESG is seen as a panacea, but a divestment in the secondary markets is often more of a statement by an investment manager to its clients using their money than it is a tool for change,"" argues Dan Harris, partner at law firm Chancery Advisors, who leads the firm's ESG, boycotts and sanctions desk. What investors gain in ESG credibility, the argument goes, they lose in influence. Divestment ""takes the responsible investor away from the conversation to make changes at the underlying security issuer,"" says Petra Dismorr, chief executive of ESG consultancy NorthPeak Advisory. Stephen Liberatore, head of ESG/ impact for global fixed income at investment firm Nuveen, says that simply selling out is reminiscent of the ""stick and no carrot"" ethical investing seen in the mid-2000s, with little incentive for issuers to reform themselves once a manager has sold up. Getting a country to behave differently, he says, ""takes longer, it's more complex"". Even so, critics suggest fund managers could do far more than they are currently doing to put pressure on problem countries. They say divestment sends a strong signal to a gov-ernment and must sometimes be resorted to, otherwise fund managers' exhortations will lack bite. ""If a large amount of money gets pulled out of Egypt or Belarus, they're going to notice,"" says Sarah Repucci, head of the research and analysis department at Freedom House adding that the fund manager will make clear to the issuer what is behind the move. Engagement needs to be part of the process, she says. ""The right way is that you first give a lot of warnings ... and, if there's no improvement, then you divest."" Among recent examples of divestment are moves by AkademikerPension, a Danish pension fund for academics, and Germany's Union Investment to sell out of Belarus government debt. AkademikerPension now refuses to buy    government bonds or to invest in majority state-owned companies in 45 countries, including China and Saudi Arabia, because of corruption or human rights abuses. Fund managers already have to balance pressure from NGOs not to fund authoritarian regimes with the need to make money for investors. Complicating matters further is the possibility that divesting from some countries bonds could do more harm than good to the poorer members of those societies. One example often cited by fund managers is Egypt. The country last year issued a so-called ""green bond"", designed to finance environmental projects. But the country has also been experiencing ""its worst human rights crisis in many decades"", according to advocacy group Human Rights Watch, with ""tens of thousands"" of government critics including journalists and human rights defenders in prison on politically motivated charges. Freedom House rates the country as ""not free"" and says ""security forces engage in human rights abuses with impunity"". Nuveen's Liberatore says he invested in Egypt's green bond because the proceeds would go to waste water management and sanitation services, which would particularly help the poor. ""We felt that this particular deal was directly funding and improved living standards for those most in need,"" he explains. Patrick Scheideler, co-founder of MultiLynq, a fixed-income trading platform, says the question over Egypt's green bond was not straightforward and that the lack of attractive returns elsewhere ""probably makes it an even more difficult issue to tackle"" for yield-hungry fund managers. Ana Perez Adroher, project officer in human rights and sustainable investment at the International Federation for Human Rights, says whether to sell out of a bond or not depends on a country's specific situation and on investors' assessment of their power to influence it. She likens the debate to that on sanctions: does the pressure they exert on oppressive governments outweigh the harm they inflict on ordinary citizens? But she adds that there is an obligation for fund managers to do due diligence by talking to NGOs and those who have suffered human rights abuses. ""The conversation is more and more out there with regard to bonds, but there's still a lot of work to be done,"" she says. Freedom House's Repucci says investors are increasingly concerned about lending to regimes that violate human rights, adding that they should take steps to understand where their money is going. ""If they're not aware of the human rights implications of their investments, they're in a way complicit in the abuses,"" she says. 'If a large amount of money gets pulled out of Egypt or Belarus, they're going to notice'"

2808c623b7352c259858,2021-10-16,ESG 'illusion raises potential ethical issues',"INVESTMENT Swiss financier challenges consensus on green investing The idea that investors can make more money while doing more for the planet or society is ""an illusion"", according to one of the European asset management industry's biggest philanthropists. Bernard Sabrier, a five-decade finance veteran who controls and chairs Swiss investment firm Unigestion, says mixing investment gains and trying to do good a concept at the heart of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing could lead to ""potential ethical issues"". ""My question and I am still struggling with this are we going to make more money by being ESG compliant? That I don't know if it is true,"" Sabrier, 68, whose firm has $22.1bn in assets under management, told the FT's Moral Money. ""My worry is that when you mix doing good with potential profit, that is where the ethical frontier might be breached,"" he added. ""I think it is an illusion for me to tell people: do good and you will make more money."" His comments come as a direct rebuke to the widelypromoted concept in investment management of socalled ""ESG alpha"" in other words, the notion that, rather than sacrificing profits in pursuit of ethical investing, investors can increase their profits while also doing good. The finance industry has devoted huge resources to ESG investing in recent years, and trillions of dollars have flowed into such funds. Global investment assets defined as being sustainable have grown to $35.3tn last year, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, up from $22.8tn in 2016. But concerns have grown over whether the reality of ESG investing matches the bullish claims. This year, Tariq Fancy, formerly BlackRock's first global chief investment officer for sustainable investing, wrote that sustainable investing boiled down to little more than ""marketing hype"" and ""disingenuous promises"". And in July, a Financial Times investigation found that funds firms with strong rhetoric about tackling human rights abuses were lending money to regimes carrying out abuses, often with little sign they were even raising concerns about these violations when talking to issuers. Sabrier said the industry's rush into ESG created the potential for problems later. ""We won't have catastrophes, but we will have, most probably, people who will say things they will not do and people who will believe things that will not happen,"" he said. In 2011 Sabrier, an early pioneer of investing in hedge funds, set up Famsa Foundation, a charity which gives money to projects in areas such as children's health and environmental conservation. He has donated the vast majority of his 45 per cent ownership stake and 55 per cent voting stake in Unigestion to the foundation. He added that there should be a ""clear border"" between a person's philanthropic efforts and their investing, and that mixing the two was ""a complex exercise"". He said: ""I think you should make money to do philanthropy or social projects."" Read more on ESG at FT.com/moral-money"

91bf8d05712fffc37184,2021-10-15,Amazon: 'We wanted to help',"In-houseLawyers tackled legal and data privacy issues to deliver Covid test kits in the UK, says Yasmin Lambert In early 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold in the UK, the government approached the private sector to help with its national response. Amazon UK agreed to use its logistics expertise and network to boost testing capacity by delivering test kits to workers in the NHS and other key workers. ""Amazon is a retailer, but its UK team had never been involved in a project quite like this,"" says Alex Simpson, UK legal director at Amazon. ""Although we hadn't done that before, we very much wanted to help. Amazon UK's existing agreements were unfit for this type of service. Lawyers had to reengineer contracts and existing frameworks, and engage with the data privacy regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, and standards bodies to create a new model. Their quick work meant the service was running by March 26 2020, just days after it was proposed. Amazon decided not to charge for the service through which it delivered more than 7m test kits to the homes of essential workers and the public. Simpson says: ""It would have been very easy for any one of the team at any moment to say 'Amazon hasn't done this before, I think it's too risky', yet no one did. The drive, determination, innovation and creativity was immense."" Amazon UK's lawyers are therefore named the most innovative in-house legal team in the Europe FT Innovative Lawyers awards for 2021. They tackled unfamiliar legal and data privacy issues to deliver the Covid testing distribution project and to set up in-house labs for testing Amazon employees. The team also supported the business through a period of extraordinary growth and new ventures, including the launch of physical stores. After the disruption of the pandemic, all companies face further upheaval. And the submissions to the various award categories, showcased on the following pages, look at longer-term changes under way among inhouse legal teams: advances in legal operations; renewed focus on people and skills; and the expanding influence of lawyers on the sustainability and environment, social and governance agenda. In the realm of legal operations, automation technologies and data analytics are transforming areas of legal work, such as how contracts are drafted and managed. Bayer, the German life sciences company, has shifted its entire contracting team to shared services centres, where they manage a tech-led process from initial request through the lifecycle to filing, managing and reporting. The legal team handled more than 15,000 new contract requests in the first nine months of 2021. For the teams at BNP Paribas bank and fintech Revolut, new risk management technologies are collecting and analysing rich data to help lawyers better advise their businesses. In the financial services industry, being able to communicate in the same language as the business and back advice up with statistics, is also valuable. In-house legal teams are recruiting more data, technology and process experts as they become more digital, but lawyers also need to expand their skills. ""During the pandemic there has been [an evolution in] what being a business partner means for in-house lawyers,"" says Oliver Searle, lead counsel at Chevron, the oil company.    ""Knowing the business is a given. You also need to understand the basics of process improvement, project management, and data collection."" Looking further ahead, how in-house lawyers will manage risks associated with climate change and greenwashing misstatements about eco-friendly policies is rising up the agenda. Nestlé has a team of five sustainability lawyers with expertise in climate change, sustainable sourcing, and human rights. Counter to the instincts of many in-house lawyers, they are seeking more regulation. They are working on promoting recycling regulations and standards for assessing carbon offsets and claims about carbon neutrality. Many individual lawyers — such as Nestlé's general counsel for sustainability, Esteban Mezzano — have been drawn to sustainability roles through personal conviction. But, as with data and tech skills, expertise in these roles is expected to become a core competency for inhouse lawyers in the coming years. RESEARCH AND AWARD SUPPORTED BY Most innovative in-house legal teams Europe 2021 Winner Amazon UK* Archer-Daniels-Midland (EMEAI) Axa Bayer Vodafone *Winner of the FT Innovative Lawyers award for 'Most innovative in-house legal team in Europe'; other organisations are listed alphabetically Case studies Sustainability and ESG Winner Axa The Axa legal team worked with a consortium of eight insurers that launched the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, chaired by AXA Group chief risk officer Renaud Guidée. Many insurance companies have chosen to divest from fossil fuels and are now pushing for change in the businesses they underwrite. The alliance - an initiative by the UN Environment Programme - has developed a common methodology and performance indicators for underwriting portfolios, which will help insurers speed up moves towards net-zero carbon targets. The Axa legal team played a critical role in setting up the alliance by working through complex antitrust issues that cleared the way for the competing companies to collaborate. EIT Climate-KIC The need to drive innovation to fight climate change led to the foundation of the Climate Knowledge and Innovation Community. The aim of the project, supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, an EU agency, is to bring together business and academia. The KIC was formed as a private company but has become a non-profit foundation. This type of deal had no precedent. The change has been handled by Anna White, general counsel of Climate-KIC. The organisation's public mission is now clearer and it is able to access new funding. Investec Bank Funds lawyers at Investec helped create a new type of ESG-linked credit facility for Investindustrial, the European private equity house. They defined sustainability measurements that, if met by Investindustrial, will reduce the interest rate paid on the loan. These sustainability goals, targets and reporting measurements create a standard that can be used as an incentive for other sustainable investments in the private equity industry. Sonnedix A sustainability academy set up by Sonnedix, a solar power company, provides resources and site visits to schools and universities. It is on track to reach 100,000 people in education with its message about renewable energy and climate change. The Sonnedix legal team is responsible for ESG issues at the group and it led in the creation of the academy, which aims to give new generations the skills they will require to enable growth and innovation. Nestlé A team of five sustainability lawyers and 150 sustainability ambassadors from the global legal team at Nestlé have helped to produce new waste regulations and better standards for packaging. They defined a concept of ""plastic neutrality"" and recently used it to promote the development of recycling infrastructure in Colombia. They are also involved in a cross-industry group that is setting standards for how carbon offsets are calculated. CNIL with Amurabi CNIL, the French data protection commission, worked with Amurabi, a legal design agency, to improve how young people engage with privacy policies and ensure that they know their data rights on the internet. They set up focus groups and ""cocreation"" sessions, which led to the development of better interface designs. These discourage the ""blind clicking"" of on-screen agreements by motivating users to read and then to make an informed decision about their rights. Researched, compiled and ranked by RSGi. 'Winner' indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award Case studies People and skills Winner Aviva UK Lawyers at the insurer have helped to launch several initiatives in the past 18 months. They advised on the development of a mental health toolkit that has been shared with corporate customers of Aviva's health business.    In addition to defining legal issues around consent and data, lawyers ensured the toolkit can be used by a range of corporate customers and by Aviva internally. Project Edge, a training and development programme, has also equipped legal staff to play a more strategic role in the business. Under a new social mobility strategy, the team is providing internships and mentoring to help make legal careers more accessible. ShellShell has developed the ""We Care"" principles initiative to positively influence mental health and wellbeing in the wider legal industry. It outlines specific expectations and practices the team should follow in areas that include working hours, timelines, respecting commitments outside work, and communications etiquette. The team now applies the principles to how it instructs and communicates with outside lawyers. Amazon UK The legal team worked fast to advise on data privacy and other legal and regulatory requirements to enable the company to open its own Covid testing facility in the UK, in the early stages of the pandemic. The facility provided tests to thousands of employees. The model was followed by Amazon operations in Europe and the US. Researched, compiled and ranked by RSGi.

Its 200 member countries have agreed to share resources for research, development and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines to ensure more equitable access globally. Lawyers negotiated different agreements with highand low-income countries, humanitarian partners, development banks and pharma companies. They created new legal, financial and insurance mechanisms to manage risks, which were critical to securing the participation of countries receiving the vaccines — and from the vaccine makers. easyJet The airline's legal team helped guide the company through a tumultuous 18 months, which included Covid-19 travel restrictions, a cyber attack, and a dispute with the company's founder as he attempted to remove its chief executive and chair. Critically, lawyers helped restructure the company and raise £5.5bn through a series of transactions. Amazon UK Lawyers led on setting the strategy and moving quickly to create supply agreements to source and distribute more than 7m Covid test kits to the homes of essential workers and the public in the UK. Under the agreement with the UK government, Amazon offered its logistic networks and expertise free of charge. Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team Lawyers devised an intellectual property model to enable the F1 team to launch its Applied Science business. The division provides engineering and design consulting to clients, which include other professional sports teams such as the Ineos Team UK America's Cup sailing team. European Investment Fund After Brexit, the fund's lawyers designed and drafted new legislation to establish professional payment guarantees as a financial instrument in Luxembourg. Lawyers selected the jurisdiction and lobbied to introduce the new law. This allowed the fund to move all its debt documentation from English to Luxembourg law, and sign €10bn in new guarantees. Galp Energia Over two years, the legal team of the Portuguese oil and gas group led almost 180 transactions, involving thousands of plots of land, to establish new solar power generation facilities. The team created standardised agreements and a risk assessment method to manage the volume of deals. The projects are helping the company shift towards clean energy production. Société Générale Forge A multidisciplinary team that combines expertise in legal, regulatory, capital markets and blockchain issues is pioneering new digital financial products. It worked with the European Investment Bank, the EU's lending arm, to issue its first digital bond on a public blockchain, and on a subsequent transaction to borrow back the bond via the blockchain. BT Group When the US placed restrictions on 5G communications technology made by China's Huawei, lawyers in BT Technology helped plan for a range of outcomes as the UK decided the terms of its own ban. It is now managing agreements with landlords to swap equipment at 19,000 network sites over the next seven years, and negotiating new supply and engineering contracts. Vodafone In-house lawyers worked on the corporate and financing structure for a deal in which Vodafone UK and Telefónica UK turned their telecoms tower joint venture, Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure, into a new independent company. The structures and agreements ensure Vodafone's long-term access to essential infrastructure.    Revolut Lawyers created a tool, the Contract Risk Quantifier, to evaluate the fintech's commercial contracts. It has helped to ensure more consistency in new contracts, and to monitor and improve current agreements. Researched, compiled and ranked by RSGi. 'Winner' indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award Case studies Legal operations Winner Bayer Legal operations at the German life sciences company have been transformed over the past two years by centralising, streamlining and digitising its contracting, data privacy and compliance activities. These are now managed by specialised teams that sit in the company's shared services centres and draw on a more diverse range of people and skills. The contracting team has automated the end-to-end process for more than 50 contract types in many languages, which has allowed business colleagues to create thousands of contracts quickly and easily. The team can automatically track obligations and mine data for new insights, thanks to a fully digital contracting process. BNP Paribas In the latest version of Sara, an online risk-reporting tool created for the bank's global legal team, lawyers have new dashboards and a risk taxonomy and scoring grid. The app is also used to shape the bank's onboarding process for new law firms. The tool tracks and automatically alerts team members if panel law firms' arrangements are being breached. Vodafone The UK legal team at the British telecommunications company has continued to develop its contracting technology, and one of the benefits is that the sales team can generate their own contracts. An artificial intelligence function enables the sales team to access contract data to help them manage customer relationships better and to note trends in its customer base. Archer-Daniels-Midland The ADM legal team for Europe, Middle East, Africa and India led and project-managed the legal aspects of setting up a blockchain joint venture involving the world's six largest agricultural companies. The Covantis blockchain platform digitises and tracks global agricultural shipping, and replaces a century-old paper-based process. Lawyers used agile project management to co-ordinate multiple partners, legal and technology team members. Their navigation of the complex European competition and regulatory challenges was essential to making the platform work. Chevron A digital advisory board is driving digital transformation in the legal department of the oil company by introducing new tech tools and shifting mindsets. The inclusion of technology targets in performance reviews and new training modules are helping to drive cultural change. The team used design thinking techniques, which focus on the user experience, to create a visual and clearly worded resource for business colleagues to manage brand licensing projects. Capgemini The French IT services group set up a global legal centre to connect lawyers working in multiple offices and countries. The result is a global hub for lawyers in local teams to share knowledge and expertise, train new legal team members, develop technology and legal processes, and buy outside legal services. Carrefour The French retail group's Iberian legal team automated all its supplier contracts — enabling their business colleagues to produce tens of thousands of new contracts each year, without involving lawyers. The digital process ensures that contracts are compliant, which reduces risk and saves time, allowing the team to collect and analyse new data on supplies of different products for its stores. Crédit Agricole CIB New technologies are streamlining legal contracts and documents at the investment arm of the French bank, in order to improve how it interacts with clients. Internally, the legal team has connected systems to analyse invoicing and legal task information, allowing them to make data-driven decisions about allocating resources and where they send legal work.

bd74b04a9c2c2e8a6b1f,2021-10-15,Calls for action on ESGissues boosts demand for legal expertise,"ESG investing Law firms are helping companies to meet sustainability targets, writes Patrick Temple-West Law firms are racing to catch up with the financial sector's embrace of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing as they see the potential for deals and regulations aimed at combatting global warming to deliver billable hours. Nearly all the global law firms now have ESG or sustainability practices and the past year has seen unprecedented activity. From big dollar M&A deals to contracting work, the legal sector has recognised the need for ESG action. At law firm Ashurst, lawyers are working with clients to embed a host of environmental clauses into contracts. In projects with construction clients, for instance, an increasingly standard requirement for contractors includes mandating an energy performance certificate (EPC) of at least an ""A"" for buildings, to prove they are energy efficient. Other clauses require parties to meet certain carbon emissions targets, which, if breached, require a remediation fee donated to a selected environmental charity, the firm says. ""Clients are increasingly focusing not only on their own net-zero commitments but how that interplays with the customers and suppliers,"" say Anna-Marie Slot, global ESG and sustainability partner at Ashurst. ""The work that we are doing with clients building ESG clauses into their contracts so that they can deliver on net-zero promises will only increase."" Ashurst is one of the dozens of law firms that have teamed up to create open-source contract clauses that deliver climate solutions. The initiative, called the Chancery Lane Project, has developed contract terms that encourage suppliers to adopt environmental targets to reduce a company's indirect carbon emissions. It also offers ""coolerplate"" generic clauses to make it easier for lawyers to embed climate issues and net-zero targets into a contract. Social media has exposed companies to public judgment of their ESG credentials, says Adrian Walker, a partner at Hogan Lovells and head of the law firm's ESG practice. This can be reputationally damaging for those whose actions fail to match up to their promises. There is also growing recognition that companies delivering on ESG commitments tend to outperform their competitors. ""We are seeing a shift from ESG contractual provisions that require legal compliance, to those that drive performance,"" he notes. Bank of America research shows that, during the stock market plunge around the Covid-19 outbreak, ESG investment strategies outperformed by 5 to 10 percentage points in the US and Europe. Companies with lower ESG scores suffered bigger drops in their earnings per share. Lawyers are also needed for corporate ESG disclosures, particularly as regulators are on the hunt for misleading claims, or greenwashing. Failure poses material risks, ranging from litigation to reputational damage, Walker says.    The European Commission is also rolling out a taxonomy for sustainable finance next year a labelling scheme to help steer investment into green projects by setting out which activities align with EU environmental goals. ""You have to report on the proportion of your business that relates to taxonomy-eligible activities at first and, in later years, on what is taxonomy aligned,"" explains Vanessa Havard-Williams, global head of environment at Linklaters. ""The detail is really fiddly."" ESG is increasingly part of the due diligence process in mergers and acquisitions, too. Lawyers have seen ""Weinstein clauses"", named after the disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, that require target companies to disclose allegations of sexual misconduct among their senior executives, according to law firm Wachtell Lipton. Entire countries can be held to account, as well. Litigation firm Hausfeld worked with the charity Save the Children to intervene in the first climate change case before the European Court of Human Rights. Following deadly wildfires in Portugal in 2017, young people from the region challenged that countries were not doing enough to combat global warming. ESG legal work has even stretched to antitrust law. The office of the EU's head of digital and competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, has studied how competition rules could be changed to work with the EU's green deal. Dechert is now working on ways to tweak antitrust provisions to help businesses collaborate on climate change initiatives. ""The need is clear for explicit guidance on what is permissible,"" the firm says. Case studies Sustainability and ESG Winner Hausfeld Lawyers at the firm are leaders in global climate litigation and they have drawn on Hausfeld's expertise in children's rights. The firm filed a petition with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on behalf of Greta Thunberg, the environmental campaigner, and 15 other young people aged eight to 17. This argued that state failures to tackle climate change violated the human rights of children. It also helped the Save the Children charity to argue for the rights of children in the first climate change case at the European Court of Human Rights. Dechert Since 2018, Dechert has been part of a lobby pressing for changes in competition law that will allow sustainability initiatives to go ahead, such as ensuring farmworkers receive a living wage. This has involved working with the Fair Trade Advocacy Office, based in Brussels, and talking to European authorities. Dechert hosted events, offered analysis and introduced campaigners to government bodies. So far, the Dutch competition authority has published new guidelines and the UK and Greece will soon follow suit. Latham & Watkins The firm's ESG task force worked with Anthesis, a global sustainability consultancy, on Risk Horizon, a due diligence tool that screens potential deals for ESG risks. The tool is now used by other law firms. Lawyers also helped data provider Standard & Poor's to launch a climate index to assess equity securities against the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The firm is advising Microsoft on how to invest its $1bn Climate Innovation Fund. Ashurst Anna-Marie Slot, global sustainability partner at the firm, leads its 100-strong ESG/ sustainability group, which aims to embed ESG principles in all the firm's activities. Ashurst's works includes advising Tritax Big Box, a logistics property specialist, on the first sterling green bond issued by a UK real estate investment trust and working with Lundin Energy, a Swedish oil and gas group, on refinancing with a $5bn ESG-linked loan. Ashurst has also launched ESG Ready, which provides latest information on regulations. Addleshaw Goddard The infrastructure and energy lawyers represented Southern Water, which supplies the south-east of England, in negotiations over an unusual collaboration with Portsmouth Water. Southern Water funded development for a new reservoir and secured access to new clean water supplies to ease shortages in the south-east. Herbert Smith Freehills The firm is a founding member of the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance, a coalition primarily made up of law firms, which aims to help the legal industry achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The firm's own aim is to reach net zero by 2030. HSF is developing software to track and manage its carbon emissions. The firm also supports the Earthshot Prize, an awards programme for initiatives that help the environment. Integrites The 12 partner firm has pivoted to focus on the ""green transition"" of its energy, mining and steel clients. It is working to kickstart the renewable energy market in Ukraine, including green hydrogen trading and energy storage, taking multiple projects through financing, licensing and regulatory approval as well as advising on corporate operations of renewable projects. The firm is also advising the Ukrainian government on a structure for tariffs and rewards to incentivise renewable energy production.    Pinsent Masons Lawyers arranged the power purchase agreements for Tesco, which mean that the UK supermarket now uses 100 per cent renewable energy in its stores and distribution centres. The contracts enable renewable energy projects to secure financing more easily. The firm also supports Tesco with its sustainability strategy, including the installation of solar panels and advising companies in its supply chain. Linklaters The firm began a programme, ESG Accelerator, to familiarise its lawyers with ESG-related matters. It involved podcasts, training for clients and staff, and roundtables for the London-based firm's senior leaders. Due to Linklaters' expertise in areas such as carbon offsetting, the firm was made the sustainability specialist on the global law firm panel of Nestlé, the food and beverage company.

ccef901451c94b6e8572,2021-10-15,Lawyers' eye for detail will tackle greenwashing,"Sustainable finance Law firms can use their expertise to test the veracity of ESG claims, writes Sarah Murray Rising demand for sustainable finance means the work of lawyers now ranges from structuring green bonds to helping to draft environmental legislation. But, as billions of dollars pour into environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments, the legal sector has another role: to tackle so-called greenwashing. The absence of standard measurement and reporting metrics for ESG investments means that companies and funds can make claims about their social or environmental impact that are exaggerated, or greenwashed. Fortunately for lawyers, bringing clarity to ambiguity is a fundamental skill. ""There is a massive amount of capital being put into sustainable finance, which clearly poses the risk that people will claim to be investing on a green basis when they are not,"" says Ian Warner, an investment funds partner at Datalis, an investment platform created by law firm Pinsent Masons. ""Lawyers are in a good place to use the tools available to make sure things don't go wrong."" Initially, rapid growth in the sustainable finance market called for legal expertise on the structuring of financial products. It gave Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, for instance, the opportunity to work on a pioneering ESG collateralised loan obligation (CLO) on behalf of its client, MUFG Securities Emea, part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the Japanese lender. While ESG language is already included in the eligibility criteria of some CLOs, this one was structured so that the status of each asset in the CLO was assessed before it was acquired and will be subject to due diligence throughout the life of the deal. ""[The CLO] actually looked into the underlying borrowers, the companies and their loans, to find out what they're all about,"" says Claire Puddicombe, a partner at the US firm's London office. As well as preventing greenwashing through financial innovation, another priority for proponents of sustainable finance is to make ESG products available to a broader set of investors, including impact-driven retail investors. Such broader access has so far been curbed by the cost of the complex due diligence demanded by ESG products and funds, and the high amounts required as a minimum to invest. To break down these barriers, lawyers at Herbert Smith Freehills worked with The Big Issue the campaigning organisation behind the street magazine sold by homeless people on its 2018 launch of the Big Exchange, a blockchain-based ESG investment platform. The platform gives investors access to ESG funds rated for their type and impact and provides an app to enable them to track their effect via live updates, stories, videos and images. From implementing data protection to drawing up agreements for partner relationships, the HSF team ensured the platform could operate smoothly. ""We were advising on governance and set-up structures, on key foundational and constitutional documents,"" says Lucy Curran, a London associate at the firm. ""And we did a lot of work around financial services regulation."" Another way to expand the market and make sure ESG funds are effective is to empower fund managers. This drove Pinsent Masons to create Datalis, an investment fund platform that provides data and automated reporting on sustainable investment opportunities.    ""Datalis is helping to educate those fund managers around what their funds should look like, in order to attract as much capital as possible from those interested in sustainable finance and impact,"" says Warner. Whether developing investment platforms or sustainable investment products, the complexity of financial markets demands broad legal skills, says Anna-Marie Slot, global ESG and sustainability partner at Ashurst. ""It's one thing to have a green bond but then you need derivatives that follow on from that, investor interest, liquidity in the after-market, and the whole system needs to be transparent,"" she says. ""Lawyers can bring to the table different approaches learnt from different businesses at different times."" As fears over greenwashing increase, however, so does the demand for sustainable finance to be better defined and subject to robust measurement and reporting. The legal sector is moving swiftly into this new area. One example is voluntary carbon markets. As more companies offset their emissions with the use of carbon credits generated by activities such as tree planting critics have highlighted the lack of standards and verification. Lawyers can help to provide an assurance that such offset projects do contribute to emissions reduction. Part of this will mean the creation of a clear definition of an offset from a legal perspective, says Ingrid York, a partner with White & Case in London. ""How do we treat it? Is it a set of contractual rights, a physical asset, or something else, and how do we transfer it? Those kinds of things excite us as lawyers and get us out of bed,"" says York, who is part of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, a private sector-led initiative that is developing recommendations for better transparency and verification. Regulation will also be essential in combating greenwashing. Lawyers can provide input to policymakers during consultation periods and explain what the new rules mean for clients. With their eye for detail, they will be able to see potential problems during the drafting process. ""One extra word can change the meaning of an entire clause,"" says Puddicombe. ""It is important when we're reviewing legislation to make sure that it reflects regulators' intention but also can be implemented by the market."" Case studies Sustainable finance lawyers helped clients navigate increasingly sophisticated offerings. Winner Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft The lawyers assisted the Europe, Middle East and Africa arm of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in developing the first European collateralised loan obligation (CLO) that will consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors across all its investments. Some CLOs include language in their eligibility criteria to restrict the types of loans that can be included to those with certain ESG scores. For this CLO, however, the lawyers created a framework to test the ESG compliance of the assets regularly throughout the deal lifetime. The firm also worked closely with collateral manager NIBC Bank in helping asset owners improve their ESG score andreporting regularly to investors on ESGperformance. Gide Loyrette Nouel Partner Nicolas Jean led the creation of a think-tank to discuss sustainable approaches to financing and debt in African countries. The group which includes ministers from Ivory Coast, Benin, Republic of Togo and Senegal, along with economists, leaders of financial institutions and lawyers has provided pro bono advice to African states negotiating with creditors. It will also publish a white paper offering recommendations to governments and financial institutions on where investment can have a genuine impact. Herbert Smith Freehills The firm helped The Big Issue the organisation behind the street magazinesold by homeless people to launch aninvestment platform, The Big Exchange,which enables people to invest in ESG andsocial impact funds starting with a minimum of £25. The lawyers constructed the legal framework, including designing a system for vetting funds to measure their impact and avoid any greenwashed products. They also protected the mission of the platform with ""golden shares"" giving The Big Issue special rights compared with other shareholders. Impact from the investment funds is recorded on a blockchain platform. Linklaters and Walkers Ireland Walkers acted as Irish counsel and Linklaters as English in helping Londonbased Tramontana asset managers to create a programme in which investors can buy EU-issued carbon certificates, which are required to secure carbon credits. Companies need these certificates that permit carbon emissions and must purchase more if they exceed their yearly limits. By using a special purpose vehicle, Tramontana has enabled these certificates to be traded as assets by retail investors. In the long term, it may increase the value of the certificates until it is cheaper for companies to invest in reducing their carbon emissions.    Pinsent Masons The impact investment team works with clients that are designing social and environmental impact funds, such as the government and private sector-backed Clean Growth Fund. This invests in clean tech brands, including Piclo, a smart energycompany, and Everyone In, a fund to tackle homelessness. The lawyers developed Datalis, a platform. that gathers historic data on investment to help inexperienced fund managers with fundraising trends and best practice. In the past year, the firm estimates its work has generated $2bn for impact investment funds. Travers Smith Lawyers helped Pay.UK, which operates the UK's retail payment operations, to draft a legal framework for Request-to-Pay. This is an alternative payment mechanism to direct debits, as consumers are sent requests for a payment by a biller rather than payments going out directly from their accounts. Mastercard has used this framework to launch a request-to-pay app for its customers and a number of financial institutions in the UK and Europe are also using the framework. Benefits include greater flexibility and control for consumers, and a reduction in failed direct debit payments. NautaDutilh Working with the bank ABN Amro in the Netherlands, the firm created a contract template for financing product-as-a-service suppliers, whereby customers purchase access but the supplier remains the owner of the goods and is responsible for maintenance and recycling. This presents more complex risks than other investments. The lawyers also created a help desk to support the bank's lawyers in reviewing product-as-a-service contracts. The longterm goal is to promote a circular economy. Hogan LovellsThe firm's sustainable finance and investing group developed a toolkit to support clients in lending and borrowing, with a focus onsustainability. This includes an initial review of the client's sustainability policies, training on various risks and benefits of sustainablefinance, and guiding clients through theprocess of introducing sustainability-linkedloans that incentivise borrowers to achieveESG targets. Researched, compiled and ranked by RSGi. 'Winner' indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award Five trailblazing sustainability leaders Ingrid Gubbay Of Counsel, Hausfeld Before moving to the UK, Ingrid Gubbay worked as a senior lawyer for Legal Aid NSW, Australia, where she brought group action cases against companies and the government. In the UK, she became principal legal adviser for Which?, the non-profit consumer rights organisation. In 2007, she joined Hausfeld, which specialises in litigation, and now heads its human rights and environmental teams. Two years ago, she represented a group of 15 young people, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, which brought a petition to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to demand action on climate change. Gubbay champions the role of lawyers in tackling global warming. She chaired the London Climate Change Litigation forums, which were held to coincide with the negotiation of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. Nicolas Jean Partner, Gide Loyrette Nouel French lawyer Nicolas Jean is an adviser in financial markets in countries including Ivory Coast, Benin and Senegal. Inspired by French President Emmanuel Macron's call in 2020 for debt relief in Africa, Jean called on his contacts in institutions and governments across the continent. This resulted in a think-tank, sponsored by Gide Loyrette Nouel, which advises on strategies for financing African development without creating unsustainable public debt. As a practitioner, Jean has advised on many creative financing structures, including the first corporate green bond in francophone west and central Africa. Anna-Marie Slot Partner, Ashurst In 2019, Anna-Marie Slot moved from Hong Kong to London and was appointed Ashurst's first global partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability. As a practitioner, she was involved in many of the early green bonds issued in Asia-Pacific. In her new role, she helps to develop industry standards for sustainability-linked finance. She supports the non-profit Climate Bonds Initiative in advising capital markets clients and creating the first ESG guidelines for the high-yield markets in Europe with the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, the London-based banking trade body. Slot has also helped develop products to educate Ashurst's clients, including ESG Ready, a digital resource on European regulation of sustainability in financial disclosure. In addition, she played a role in setting out Ashurst's 2023 sustainability goals, which include a 20 per cent reduction in carbon emissions from travel (the firm declared it was carbon neutral in January 2020). Adrian Walker Partner, Hogan Lovells In 2008, Adrian Walker anticipated the trend for law firms to have purpose statements when he helped to launch Hogan Lovells's projects practice with the slogan ""improving equality of access to sustainable infrastructure and energy"". He also took part in the launch of an MBAstyle business skills course for social enterprises run by HL BaSE, the business enterprise practice at the firm. In 2021, Walker was made head of ESG and in that role he advises governments and financial institutions on projects connected with sustainability, which have included the Met Office's acquisition of a supercomputer powered by renewable energy. He is on the World Economic Forum's social impact council and is a member of the sustainable finance group of the financial services body TheCityUK, looking at the future role of offices in cities.    Ingrid York Partner, White & Case In her position in the firm's capital markets practice, York has been involved in several firsts in sustainable finance. In 2017, she was an adviser to Crédit Agricole's corporate and investment banking arm on its $3bn green capital note, which combines synthetic securitisation with investment goals aligned to the UN's sustainable development goals. Two years later, she helped to put in place creative legal solutions that enabled a notes issuance by Société Générale, the French bank, for a risk transfer worth $3.4bn allocated for impact investment. Last year, York was appointed to a task force founded by Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, which promotes voluntary carbon markets."
8913008bfe0bbfc79c6e,2021-10-15,Research methodology Europe 2021,"FT Innovative Lawyers Europe 2021 is a ranking, report and awards scheme for lawyers based in the region. The Financial Times and its research partner, RSGi, have devised a unique methodology to rank lawyers on innovation. Law firms and in-house legal teams were invited to make submissions. The categories focus on different areas of legal practice, business and operational management, inclusion and ESG issues. The categories and examples featured in the report are drawn from submissions and nominations from law firms and in-house legal teams. Each submission is researched and scored out of 10 for originality, leadership and impact, giving a maximum score of 30 (scores for each individual entry are not shown in the report). In addition, law firms were asked to complete a questionnaire on use of data and technology. Each of the 12 questions was scored out of five and benchmarked against peers in the region. Top-ranked submissions in each category are featured as mini case studies and shortlisted for the FT Innovative Lawyers Europe 2021 awards. Some 493 submissions and nominations were received from 111 law firms and 71 in-house legal teams. RSGi researchers assessed them and interviewed clients, senior lawyers, executives, and experts between July and September 2021. Most innovative law firms in Europe 2021: The ranking showing the ""most innovative law firm in Europe"" and ""most innovative law firm in Europe (non-UK)"" is based on each firm's aggregated scores for its top six submissions plus the score for the firm's use of data and technology. Firms could make up to seven submissions. Awards were given for the top-ranked firm in Europe and the topranked firm headquartered in Europe outside the UK. Most innovative in-house legal teams in Europe 2021: Research focused on four areas of a corporate legal department: strategic and risk advice; legal operations; people and skills; and sustainability and ESG. The list of five outstanding in-house legal teams is a selection based on each team's performance in the report and is based on the sum of scores for all submissions ranked in the report. RSGi: Formerly RSG Consulting, RSGi has a record of devising ranking methodologies for professional services firms. RSGi researchers on this report were: Reena SenGupta, Yasmin Lambert, Mary Ormerod, Tom Saunders, Esther Osibodu, Andrew Popov and Anne-Marie Grigorescu."
a5d5f0e017a3c1a8ceaf,2021-10-15,Experiments in regeneration,"Law firmsClients want more long-term thinking, says Reena SenGupta How should commercial law firms measure success? The industry itself has settled on the ""PEP number"" annual profit-perequity-partner. But this measure is irrelevant to the buyers of legal services, who want long-term, big picture thinking from their lawyers. In fact, a focus on PEP tends to result in the opposite approach. ""The legal profession has a fundamental problem with short-termism,"" says Simon Levine, global co-chief executive of DLA Piper. Partners' reluctance to divert their annual earnings towards experimental longterm investments means normal business activities such as innovation or research and development are too often negligible. However, two big law firms seem to have worked out how to sidestep this short-termism and the constraints of the partnership model, in ways that clearly show how the legal business is metamorphosing. One of them is Levine's firm. DLA Piper has set up Aldersgate Holding, a wholly owned subsidiary, to invest in new technology and allied activities, such as blockchain and litigation funding. Although funded by the partners, it has the autonomy to be far nimbler than law firm management teams. ""I genuinely don't think people will achieve true innovation unless they can reinvest into longer-term projects,"" says Levine. As a former media lawyer whose clients included The Beatles, he says his experiences inspired him ""to think more broadly and creatively. I've applied that not just to legal problems but also to broader challenges"". The other firm, Allen & Overy, set up the Markets Innovation Group (MIG) in 2018 to encourage a more ""start-up"" culture and to invest in long-term projects. Unlike DLA Piper's venture, it sits inside the firm but MIG is treated like a client. Lawyers' time spent on MIG projects can be recorded as billable hours, thanks to a system specially developed by the MIG and A&O's finance team. Now a multidisciplinary 30-strong team, MIG has £5m this year to invest in firm-wide projects. ""It has transformed an unstructured approach to research and development into a structured approach, allowing us to scale up our R&D while scaling down individual risk,"" says David Wakeling, the partner leading MIG. Both Allen & Overy and DLA Piper have a history of investing in business lines alongside traditional legal practice. Aosphere, Allen & Overy's online risk management business, has been operating for 20 years. DLA Piper, under Levine, has set up a ""change council"" to drive radical change. Lawyers are assessed partly on their contribution to the change agenda, and most have been trained in design-thinking. With its emphasis on experimentation and the end user, design thinking has been adopted by many leading European law firms as a way to help change mindsets. Even smaller continental firms, such as Gómez-Acebo & Pombo, have set up design centres that streamline the way lawyers draft contracts and use tech. Similarly, blending legal services with other offerings is becoming the norm in many firms. Some, such as listed law firm DWF, are putting integrated services at their core. Others, such as Dentons and Norton Rose Fulbright, offer integrated services to selected clients. The John Lewis Partnership, the UK retailer, recently used Dentons' Helix mix of different services for a fixed fee.    That leading firms want to transform how lawyers approach their work is particularly evident in the proliferation of environmental, social and governance (ESG) groups. For many, these provide a way to get over internal silos and reflect how giving legal advice can no longer be a passive service. Lawyers must consider not only commercial context, but issues such as climate change and social impact. Osborne Clarke is formalising this approach in its ""3D"" client service model, in which lawyers consider transformational trends when giving advice. The pandemic accelerated many changes, not least digitalisation and working from home. Sharing knowledge is one of the hardest challenges for law firms, so Spain's Garrigues has introduced a single digital platform where it carries out all its work and can capture, analyse and use its institutional expertise. Mixing up office and homeworking is now in favour. Such a shift would have been unthinkable before the pandemic, yet legal firms are now borrowing ideas, such as agile working, from tech and engineering. Pinsent Masons has rolled out lean working principles in one case cutting a due diligence process down from 12 months to eight weeks. Transformation is under way but the word itself ""can put people off,"" warns Alastair Morrison, the partner in charge of driving change at Pinsent Masons. ""This is more about the legal business regenerating what you are looking for is the outcome,"" he says. ""You want people to look at the firm in three years' time and say, the firm has regenerated itself."" RESEARCH AND AWARD SUPPORTED BY"

It includes a record of how the firm operates its own business and contributes to the community through pro bono work, and how it advises clients on incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards into investment and operations. The firm's chief innovation officer, Kristina Dziadevych, is pushing practitioners to work in new ways. These include introducing legal design principles to make due diligence reports more user-friendly, and launching an alternative legal services team that has developed new solutions, such as a case management tool for litigation. Antas da Cunha Ecija & Associados Portugal Intelligent knowhow Under the leadership of partner Nuno da Silva Vieira, the firm has created a legal intelligence department that experiments with offering technological solutions to challenges faced by lawyers. Projects include: the exploration of smart contracts, where blockchain technology automatically fulfils obligations; a legal augmented intelligence programme with technology company IBM; and a knowledge management application that standardises the firm's knowledge, making it easier to train junior lawyers. Dottir Finland Lean designers Helsinki is seen as the global centre of the legal design movement, and Dottir is one of the law firms leading the way in integrating design principles with legal practice. Focusing on the user is a core strategic principle at the firm. It has employed lean working principles, whereby lawyers work iteratively with clients in order to reach a legal solution more quickly than they would otherwise, building and improving as they go along. They also work from documents that are user-friendly and accessible. This model is particularly effective for start-up financing work, and the firm handles around half of all start-up financing rounds in Finland. Ellex Estonia Digital movers Ellex lawyers have seen the benefits of thinking digitally in their practice, from using technology to simplify case management to reaching clients via social media for a class action case. Partner Ants Nõmper led a comprehensive response to challenges that have arisen from the pandemic, such as advising the Estonian government on policies to promote vaccination uptake and helping to compile guidelines on the distribution of medical resources. Digital expertise proved invaluable, with Ellex lawyers drafting terms of service for an occupational health provider's app, assisting a medical centre to set up a digital clinic to host remote appointments, and helping health tech start-up Certific to launch an application process for digital national immunity passports. Goksu Safi Isik Turkey Building platforms As a specialist in large, complex projects for clients that include Istanbul Airport, Goksu Safi Isik identified a benefit in using digital platforms to manage cases. The firm has a separate technology business called Newmind that worked closely with lawyers to create a tech platform called Mecellum. This uses artificial intelligence and automation to assist with project management, due diligence and document drafting. As well as developing new products, the additional expertise has attracted more talent to the firm and helped it find a niche in developing Turkish language AI for legal tech. LCA Studio Legale Italy Design at the core Partner and serial innovator Marco Imperiale led the creation of a legal design practice at the firm, providing training to clients as well as consulting on projects, such as making privacy policies and other documents more userfriendly. LCA's innovation team is experimenting with tech tools such as    natural language processing for document searches and blockchain for applications in intellectual property protection. NGL Legal Poland Networked boutiques After launching NGL Legal in 2018, rather than trying to expand the firm in the traditional way through new hires and acquisitions managing partner Krzysztof Wiater founded NGL Symbio: a partnership between six independent law firms in central and eastern Europe. This alliance covers 50 jurisdictions and communications are shared between the firms, allowing clients to go wherever the resources and expertise are, and enabling the firms to collaborate when needed. Firms in the network are running joint working groups for practices including banking and finance and special topics such as cannabis law. Wiersholm Norway Market focus Under managing partner Morten Goller, the firm has restructured its practice groups by market sector rather than legal practice expertise. Lawyers are trained in mapping out legal processes and using agile methodology to innovate more quickly on projects such as in creating a new contract automation tool in collaboration with media client, Schibsted. The business development and client development functions have been expanded to help the firm build deeper relationships with clients."

The reporting and case studies on the following pages feature innovations that are potentially transformative for the legal industry. They all touch on important questions facing anyone working in the sector. Let's start with one triggered by the pandemic: would the insurers pay out on business interruption policies? That was one of the nail-biting questions for companies everywhere when businesses were forced to shut their doors. Read how regulators and lawyers worked quickly, and from home, on a case that was a landmark in more ways than one. Pages 18-23. The question for the aviation sector, grounded by travel bans, was: how to survive? The response was a rush to raise cash and some complex restructuring, all facilitated by lawyers. Page 28. The financial technology sector is bristling with legal headaches for lawyers: how do you sue when a company is not registered or regulated? Should a non-fungible token be classed as a tradeable financial asset? We look at how lawyers are grappling with new concepts while regulators are still writing the rules. Page 26. How is your health? Even lawyers who thrive on crisis will admit the effects of the pandemic have also been challenging. A record-breaking period for deals and tumult-hit clients have added to the pressure on legal advisers. Corporate wellness schemes can help but does the law industry also have ""a horrible culture"", as one lawyer claims? Page 12 More diverse hiring is welcome, and it makes business sense when a war for talent is under way. The next challenge is retention, however, or the question young lawyers will be asking is: should I stay, or should I go? Page 14. Also: in a personal account, lawyer Natalie A Carter sets out why she sometimes hesitates to recommend a career in the law to people of colour. Page 16. Work on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues has proliferated, and law firms have responded. Now consumers and regulators are asking questions about ""greenwashed"" claims to eco-friendliness: lawyers say they can help on that too. Pages 30-33. What makes a good leader? In the 2021 report, we have highlighted more individuals than ever: law firm leaders, Page 6; change makers., page 8; legal practitioners, page 24; and sustainability specialists, page 33.

Some of the lawyers profiled here for their expertise as legal practitioners arrived in their current roles from an unusual direction; some have experienced being the only woman or person of colour in the room. All are recognised for having helped clients by thinking about the future as well as the challenges of the present. The result has often been new niches created in unexplored practice areas. Diala Minott, winner of an Innovative Lawyers award, says her upbringing taught her the power of education and giving people opportunities. She tries to apply that lesson in her career today, developing a team that helps clients, whether in using technology to transform their businesses, or in initiatives such as funds that support women in business. Profiles compiled by RSGi researchers and FT editors Winner Diala Minott Partner, Paul Hastings Diala Minott has overcome more obstacles than most lawyers — including dealing with clients who would not speak to a woman when she was working on deals in the Middle East, earlier in her career Minott is now head of the UK credit funds practice at Paul Hastings in London. She advised on, and drafted, laws for Gibraltar last year to make it a competitive jurisdiction for funds post-Brexit. Minott's team is experimenting with tech. For example, it is building a platform with private equity firm Pantheon Ventures that aims to smooth the investor onboarding process. She has also led at the firm on the creation of funds investing in women-led business.es and ESG-rated products . With investment manager. PGIM, Minott launched a mentorship programme for young women from disadvantaged backgrounds. Hervé Ekué Partner, Allen & Overy Hervé Ekué co-led the legal team that advised a syndicate of three banks on the European Investment Bank's first issue of a digital bond on the ethereum public blockchain. Before this, two other banks in Europe had tried similar projects. on private blockchains, which is a less complex undertaking. This is the first case in Europe where notes have been subscribed to several dealers, in this case Goldman Sachs, Santander and Société Générale. The two-year €100m bond will give the EIB, the lending arm of the EU, faster access to alternative sources of finance to fund projects.

8a022e86cad72a010d16,2021-10-13,High-yield debt investors face energy dilemma,"Markets Insight T he high-yield bond market has just experienced an extreme cycle of bust and boom in the debt of energy companies. Or, depending on your time horizon, the price swings of the past year were just part of sharp pricing roundtrips in a much longer cycle as much of the energy sector continued to shrink towards obsolescence. The market history books are still being written. For the uninitiated, companies become high yield (or less charitably but more accurately, ""junk"") in one of two ways. They issue bonds that are junk-rated or their debt is downgraded from investment grade to high yield because they hit a rough patch, becoming what is known as fallen angels. Although students walk out of Finance 101 knowing that debt-laden balance sheets should not coexist with volatile commodity prices, the highyield market underwrote this cashburning industry for years before oil and gas prices started sliding in 2014. Junk exploration and production bonds delivered a negative return of 30 per cent in 2014-15, an era that saw the bankruptcy of more than 20 per cent of the high-yield energy sector. When pundits showed the returns of the high-yield index ""ex-energy"" in 2015, it had nothing to do with environmental, social and governance issues. Rather, it was to demonstrate the underlying health of the rest of the market. It was no wonder the energy sector saw so many defaults after the underwriting binge, investors said after the dust settled in 2016. ""We won't make that mistake again"" was the refrain. But sometimes high-yield investors are asked to clean up others' mistakes. We were not consulted about the original financing of, say, Occidental Petroleum. But it became 2020's second-largest fallen angel and the largest junk energy issuer by a factor of four in March of last year. Suddenly, as a result, here came $40bn in very cheap bonds into highyield territory for us to analyse. Junk energy has returned 82 per cent since the pandemic trough, versus 28 per cent for the Bloomberg US Corporate High-Yield Bond index. As one of high-yield's largest industries, with a 13 per cent weighting in the sector benchmark, a portfolio manager ignores it at their peril. For comparison, energy is 8 per cent of the investment grade corporate market and about 3 per cent of the S&P 500 index. You might say that the high-yield market is where energy companies go to die. Or, to resurrect themselves. As risk appetite improved, high-yield investors lent $10bn to Occidental in 2020 at successively lower coupons, enabling it to refinance its debt with 2021-22 maturities. Occidental's 3.5 per cent 2029 bond now trades at a spread of 2 percentage points or less over US Treasuries not far from an investment grade valuation.    Blink once and you might miss this high-yield issuer, along with several other fallen angels. The upgrade cycle will leave a big, dry well in our market. In retrospect, a relevant history lesson was the banking downgrade cycle of 2008, which saw billions of bank hybrid bonds barrel into the junk index at cents on the dollar and in some cases, rebound with returns of 10 times. Now when clients, reasonably, ask for an energy thesis, none of the answers are satisfying. Divest, and give up the incremental yield of about 0.6 of a percentage point offered by the industry over the market's benchmark index? Hold, for the last bit of appreciation as the fallen angels go back to investment grade? Hope for an ESG fund management mandate that takes the decision away from you? A harder question is: Will high-yield energy matter five years from now? Or will we see a massive fallen angel cycle as the world gets serious about fighting climate change that makes Occidental look like a dress rehearsal? Recall that the big three US automakers and US department stores had ""A"" credit ratings once upon a time. Based on our experience in various industries that downgraded their way into our world, junk investors are uniquely positioned to point out that this energy cycle is far from over. There will be money to be made along the nonlinear transition to a greener world (some are already making it). Don't reassign your high-yield energy analysts' new coverage just yet. They may have a few dry years, but the likelihood of striking oil as this cycle grinds on is high. Ellen Carr is a bond portfolio manager at Barksdale Investment Management. Barksdale may hold interests in companies mentioned The question is whether we will see a massive fallen angel cycle with the fight against climate change"
19b5ca237848920faeca,2021-10-12,Shift to sustainability drives 'reboot' of European private market investing,"Asset management The rise in demand for sustainable investments is driving a ""structural reboot"" of private market investing in Europe with environmental, social and governance funds on track to account for up to two-fifths of the industry's assets in just a few years. According to research from PwC, ESG private market assets could hit between €775.7bn and €1.2tn by 2025, up from €253bn in 2020, as regulation and client demand force an overhaul of private equity, real estate, infrastructure and private debt funds. The PwC forecast suggests ESG assets could comprise 27 to 42 per cent of Europe's private markets asset base in 2025, from nearly 15 per cent last year. Olivier Carré, financial services market leader and sustainability sponsor at PwC Luxembourg, said the research was ""bullish"" on the outlook for ESG growth in private markets. He said new rules, such as the EU's sustainable finance disclosure regulations, were changing Europe's investment landscape with about one-third of PWC's survey respondents citing regulatory developments as a primary driver for revamping investment processes with respect to ESG. ""We think [ESG will result in] a structural reboot of the industry,"" he added. ""We strongly believe that [general partners] with strong ESG skills and focus will not only have better investment performance but also higher shareholder and stakeholder recognition."" He said growth would be primarily driven by a wave of new private market funds focusing on ESG investing rather than older products being rejigged to invest sustainably. PwC said that, in its best-case scenario where assets in ESG private markets funds hit €1.2tn, three-quarters of that would come from new fund launches. Recently, asset managers have rushed to launch private market ESG funds. Last week, M&G's private assets division announced a sustainable senior secured loan fund that would exclude companies involved in activities such as thermal coal, oil and gas while focusing on investing in green, social, sustainability-linked loans and bonds. Earlier this year, Tikehau Capital unveiled a private equity strategy dedicated to decarbonisation in North America while Mirova launched an impact private equity fund in September and KKR, the New York-listed private equity manager, raised $1.3bn last year for its first global impact fund. PwC predicted ESG assets under management in European private equity funds would hit €292bn under its basecase scenario by the end of 2025 while real estate ESG assets would almost double to reach €153.2bn and infrastructure sustainable assets could hit €252bn."
9d056627f9b5e1c59110,2021-10-11,'Greenium' bond margins fall,"Ethical investing ESG lenders face more pressure on their returns, reports Tommy Stubbington Investors have long been willing to pay a premium for green bonds, rewarding companies or governments that want to clean up their act by giving them lower borrowing costs. But, amid a boom in the issuance of bonds whose proceeds are earmarked for environmental spending, there are signs that this so-called ""greenium"" is being eroded. Moody's expects $450bn of green bonds to be issued worldwide in 2021, up from around $300bn last year. This should help to alleviate the scarcity that made green debt so prized by a fund management industry keen to show it is investing according to environmental, social and governance criteria. At the same time, many investors are beginning to question the logic of paying extra for a bond with a ""green"" label, arguing that there are better ways to incentivise sovereign or corporate borrowers to boost their spending on environmentally friendly projects. These fund managers say that companies or governments should be rewarded — or penalised — based on their green efforts as a whole, rather than hiving off a small part of their activities and rebadging the debt used to pay for it. ""We always evaluate an issuer in its entirety, not just one bond,"" says Madeleine King, co-head of global credit research at Legal & General Investment Management. She argues that it makes little sense to pay a premium for a green bond compared with a normal bond from the same company when the creditworthiness — and the sustainability credentials — of the issuer are the same in either case. ""We would have given up a couple of basis points [of income from the bond] essentially for nothing,"" King says. There are signs that other investors are increasingly thinking along similar lines. Measuring greeniums — the difference in yield between green bonds and ordinary bonds of a similar maturity — is difficult to do precisely, as most green bonds coming to market do not have a conventional peer. But figures from the Association for Financial Markets in Europe suggest greeniums are shrinking in Europe's corporate bond market — one of the more advanced markets for green issuance. Spreads on ESG corporate bonds versus their ""non-sustainable"" or conventional counterparts have narrowed to less than one basis point — a 100th of a percentage point — in recent months, having climbed as high as nine basis points in 2020. In sovereign markets, where green debt remains more scarce, these bonds continue to command a premium. The UK's debut green gilt, for example, last month was priced at 2.5 basis points under the equivalent conventional gilt, according to bankers who worked on the deal — saving the Treasury £28m over the life of the £10bn 12-year bond. According to Stephen Liberatore, head of ESG for global fixed income at US asset manager Nuveen, Europe's corporate greeniums were driven by the ""technical effects"" of the European Central Bank's debt-purchasing programme and have dissipated as supply increased this year.    In the US market, where green issuance is less established, there has been no persistent greenium in evidence, Liberatore says. He argues that such premiums do not need to exist, given they imply investors should have to face a trade-off between achieving the best returns and funding sustainable companies or projects. ""The main misperception that remains in the 'responsible investing' universe is that you must sacrifice performance,"" Liberatore says. Indeed, fund managers point to other advantages of the green bond market besides lower borrowing costs. King says the process of issuing green debt encourages companies to disclose more information about sustainable practices, helping investors evaluate the ESG credentials of the overall business. Some bond investors also believe green debt, which tends to change hands less often than conventional debt, will hold up better in a market downturn. ""In periods that are more challenging for fixed income markets, green securities tend to [fall less sharply in price],"" says Scott Freedman, a portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management. ""They have stickier holders."" Even so, Freedman cautions against buying green bonds indiscriminately, particularly if it means sacrificing performance. ""We are not interested in buying a bond for the label,"" he says. ""We are not mandated by our clients to accept lower returns."" One alternative to green bonds, championed by investors including Freedman, is so-called sustainabilitylinked bonds. These bonds do not have their proceeds set aside for any specific purpose. Instead, they penalise the issuer by requiring higher interest payments to investors if the issuer fails to meet certain sustainability targets — such as cutting carbon emissions. The market for sustainabilitylinked debt is much younger and smaller than that for green bonds — the first such bond was issued two years ago by Italian energy group Enel — but Freedman argues they are ""more powerful"" in funding the transition to a low-carbon economy. Sustainability-linked bonds are also more suitable for the traditionally polluting industries that are trying to make themselves greener, argues King. French oil firm Total, for example, earlier this year committed to issuing only this type of debt. ""Unlike with a green bond, this sets a real target,"" King argues. ""I think it has the potential to become the standard."""

b0d3a9839124b9b36ea0,2021-10-09,How Larry Fink became the King of Wall Street,"He built BlackRock from a small nvestment house into the biggest money manager the planet has ever seen. But should one man or his company wield so much power? By Robin Wigglesworth n April 16 2009, Rob Kapito went to the newly built Yankee Stadium, where O the pride of New York was taking on the Cleveland Indians. The economy was in a shambles, after the US mortgage crisis had rocked the global financial system, and many Wall Streeters were desperate for distractions. But the balding former bond trader was not there to watch a game of baseball. Kapito was on a secret mission that would not only transform the fortunes of his employer, the investment group BlackRock, but change the face of the financial industry. Bob Diamond, the chief executive of Barclays Capital, was watching the game from his corporate box at the stadium, and Kapito needed an urgent, discreet chat with his old friend. So he scalped a ticket and made his way to the Bronx. Barclays had taken a plunge by acquiring the US parts of Lehman Brothers when the investment bank imploded in 2008, but the deal quickly became a deadweight dragging the British bank down as well. By early 2009, Barclays was scrambling to raise money and avoid a UK government bailout. That meant it was open to selling the family silver, including its pioneering asset management arm Barclays Global Investors. It was even willing to sell it off piecemeal. In early April, Barclays accepted a $4.2bn offer from CVC, a London-based private equity firm, for BGI's rapidly growing exchange-traded fund (ETF) unit, iShares. Crucially, the agreement included a 45-day ""go-shop"" provision, which permitted Barclays to talk to other people who might be interested in topping CVC's offer. This gave Black- Rock an opening but one it had to seize quickly. The Yankees lost to Cleveland that night, but Kapito missed the entire game. He rushed up to Barclays' corporate box, knocked on the door and asked Diamond to come out for a chat. Diamond agreed, and the two went for a walk. ""Do you want to play checkers, or do you want to play chess?"" BlackRock's president asked Diamond, and presented his proposal. Instead of selling iShares to CVC, Barclays should sell all of BGI to BlackRock, said Kapito, in return for a big slug of money and stock in the combined company. That way, Barclays would get the capital it needed to avoid a bailout and still enjoy an interest in its money management arm through a substantial block of ownership in BlackRock, which would be transformed into a giant of the investing world. ""That's a very intriguing idea,"" Diamond replied. In fact, he had already received board approval to explore the sale of the entire business, and thought BlackRock was a natural buyer. He agreed to bring his boss John Varley,    to visit Kapito and BlackRock's chief executive, Larry Fink, the next day. Two months later, the deal worth $13.5bn at the time was sealed and announced to the world. Despite some early strife, it has proved phenomenally successful. BlackRock has become the largest asset manager on the planet, investing money for everyone from pensioners to wealthy oligarchs and sovereign wealth funds. Today, it is one of the biggest shareholders in virtually every major company in America and quite a few internationally as well. It is also one of the biggest lenders to companies and governments around the world. And its technology platform Aladdin provides essential wiring for swaths of the global investment industry. By the end of June this year, Black- Rock was managing a whopping $9.5tn in assets, a number that would be barely comprehensible to most of the 35m Americans whose retirement funds were managed by the company in 2020. Assuming its recent pace of growth has continued, BlackRock could reveal in its third-quarter results on October 13 that the number has crossed the $10tn mark. By the end of the year, it is likely to have vaulted over that level. To put this in context, it is roughly equivalent to the entire global hedge fund, private equity and venture capital industries combined, and has catapulted Fink, now 68, from being a highly regarded finance industry chieftain into the rarefied ranks of corporate executives referred to by their first name. Today ""Larry"" is the undisputed king of Wall Street. Having founded a small bond investment house just three decades ago, he has managed to build it into a vast financial empire, the likes of which have never been seen before. However, with power has come mounting scrutiny. BlackRock has become a lightning rod for criticism for both the political left and right. Even some fellow Wall Street tycoons quietly express disquiet over its gargantuan size. BlackRock has recently courted controversy in China, with George Soros accusing the firm of making a ""tragic mistake"" by pouring investors' money into the country even as President Xi Jinping's Communist party takes ever-firmer control of the economy. Concerns over BlackRock's heft are only going to increase in the coming years. This is the tale of how Fink became the most powerful person in global finance, a consigliere to presidents and prime ministers and with clout in almost every major corporate boardroom in the world. Titan of finance was hardly written in Fink's stars. He was born on November 2 1952, and grew up in Van Nuys, a nondescript neighbourhood in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. His father owned a shoe store while his mother was an English professor at California State University's Northridge campus. Larry didn't do as well academically as his older brother so he had to help out at his father's shop a chore his more gifted sibling was exempted from. Fink drifted into a political theory degree at UCLA. Aside from some basic economics he did no business studies until his senior year, when on a whim he signed up for some graduate classes in real estate and got hooked. But the property-developer dream faded after an MBA at UCLA's business school. Like many bright young men of the time without a firm idea of what they wanted to do except make money, Fink strutted off to Wall Street, long-haired and sporting a turquoise bracelet given to him by his high-school sweetheart and future wife Lori. He had several offers from top investment banks, but to his chagrin flubbed the final interview with Goldman Sachs. ""I was devastated, but it ended up being the blessing of blessings,"" Fink tells me. Instead, he went to First Boston, another pedigreed firm, where he started working in 1976. He was placed in its bond-trading department, and, given his real estate knowledge, was mainly trading mortgagebacked bonds. He proved a rare talent, and by 1978 was running the department. There he built a close-knit, hardworking and ferociously loyal unit around him. Many of his team were Jewish, leading some at the firm to dub Fink's desk ""Little Israel"". In the 1970s and 1980s, Italians and Jews were still sometimes held at arm's length at Waspier Wall Street firms such as First Boston. He recalls his manager telling him to hire a ""wop"" a racial slur referring to a person of Italian heritage to work on the desk when everyone else was off for the Jewish holidays. This turned out to be a working-class Wharton graduate from Monticello named Robert Kapito. But when Rosh Hashana arrived, it emerged that Kapito was as Jewish as the rest of the desk. Despite the awful, casual xenophobia of the era, Fink loved it at First Boston, which was at its core scrappy and meritocratic. The reality was that no one cared who you were, as long as you made money. And Fink made money. Although he was more cerebral than many bond traders, Fink's ego grew in tandem with his success, and his cockiness grated with some colleagues. ""I was a jerk,"" he once admitted to Crain's, the business paper. Nonetheless, Wall Street loves success more than modesty. Fink became the youngest managing director in First    Boston's history. At just 31, he was made the youngest member of its management committee. The sky seemed the limit. But then the sky came crashing down. ""My team and I felt like rock stars. Management loved us. I was on track to become CEO of the firm,"" Fink later recalled in a speech. ""And then ... well, I screwed up. And it was bad."" In 1986, Fink's desk suddenly lost about $100m when interest rates unexpectedly fell and the hedges his team had put in place to protect themselves against such a scenario fizzled. Despite the money Fink had made at First Boston in the preceding decade, he went from CEO-in-waiting to outcast, until he eventually quit in early 1988. Nonetheless, the lessons of that humiliation proved invaluable. Some years earlier, Fink had become phone pals with Ralph Schlosstein, an investment banker at Shearson Lehman Hutton. Both were early risers, and would often call each other around 6.30am to chat about financial markets before the morning hubbub started. One evening in March 1987 they happened to be booked on the same flight from Washington to New York, so they had dinner together. It proved pivotal. Both were Democrats Schlosstein had been a Treasury official in the Carter administration before heading to Wall Street but mostly they talked about dissatisfaction with their jobs and a hunger to start something new. They started sketching out plans for a company that would model financial securities, aggregate them into a portfolio, and better analyse all the risks they contained. A few days after he formally resigned from First Boston, Fink invited a select group to his house to discuss the new venture. From First Boston came Kapito, Fink's right-hand man on the mortgage trading desk; Barbara Novick, the formidable head of portfolio products; Ben Golub, a maths wizard who had designed many of the bank's risk- management tools; and Keith Anderson, one of First Boston's top bond analysts. From Shearson Lehman, Schlosstein brought Susan Wagner and, later, Hugh Frater, two of its smartest mortgage bond specialists. Together, they resolved to start a new bond investment firm built on modern technology and sounder risk management. They still needed money to launch, so Fink dug out his Rolodex. He got in touch with Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson, two former Lehman bankers whose firm, Blackstone, was on its way to becoming a rising star of the private equity industry. Blackstone agreed to house the new venture in its offices and bankroll it with a $5m loan, in return for a 50 per cent stake. Given Blackstone's emerging brand, Fink and Schlosstein decided to hitch their ride to it, naming their new company Blackstone Financial Management (BFM). Up and running, they made their first hire, Charlie Hallac, one of Golub's former colleagues at First Boston, and set about trying to win clients, both for a new fixed income fund and the supporting technology service that Golub and Hallac were building. This was envisaged as a cutting-edge solution that would help people avoid the debacle that had befallen Fink at First Boston. It was dubbed the ""Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network,"" or Aladdin. The first version was coded on a $20,000 Sun workstation wedged between their office fridge and coffee machine. BFM enjoyed a strong start, thanks to its gold-plated connections. Within its first six years, the firm managed about $23bn, and the eight founding partners had been joined by about 150 employees. The bond market was on a roll, and pension plans were attracted by the pedigree of Fink and his team. Yet the company was heading towards a dramatic rupture with Blackstone. Fink had enticed many new hires by offering slices of equity something that gradually diluted Blackstone's ownership and angered Schwarzman. Frustrated, Fink eventually resolved that BFM and Blackstone needed a divorce. All BFM's funds had tickers a code that identifies investment vehicles in regulatory filings and data providers that started with the letter B. But an agreement with Blackstone stipulated that the new name could not include the words ""black"" or ""stone"". Bedrock was considered, but made too many people think about The Flintstones. However, the founders loved the name ""Black- Rock"". They appealed to Schwarzman and Peterson, pointing out that Morgan Stanley's 1930s split from JPMorgan burnished both firms. Peterson and Schwarzman were tickled by the idea of BlackRock as an homage to Blackstone, and blessed the new name. In 1994, Blackstone finally sold its stake in BlackRock for $240m to PNC Bank in Pittsburgh, which folded all its own money management operations into BlackRock and eventually listed it on the stock market. A long-mooted initial public offering finally arrived on October 1 1999, by which time Black- Rock's assets under management had vaulted to a hefty $165bn.    But the IPO bombed. The listing arranged by Merrill Lynch valued BlackRock at just under $900m much lower than expected. Fink was tempted to scrap the whole thing, but Merrill's chief executive David Komansky called and didn't mince his words. ""What the fuck are you doing?"" he yelled at Fink. ""Just do the IPO. If you do your job well over the next four to five years, it will be a distant memory. Just do the fucking IPO now. Don't be a fucking asshole."" Once the dotcom stock market bubble burst, BlackRock's bond-oriented business shone brighter, attracting investors looking for stability and fat, steady fees. That meant it could now use its own shares as currency with which to buy rivals, growing through acquisitions rather than by just banging on the doors of clients or starting new teams from scratch. The history of the investment industry is riddled with acquisitions gone awry, but BlackRock used its listing to transform itself from a narrow bond investment house into the world's biggest money manager. The first deal came in the summer of 2004, when BlackRock bought State Street Research, a money manager owned by insurer MetLife, for $375m. But the first truly transformational deal arrived a few years later. In 2006, the well-connected Fink learnt that Merrill Lynch's new CEO Stan O'Neal was open to the idea of selling the investment bank's sprawling money-management arm. Intrigued, he arranged breakfast at 3 Guys, a restaurant on the Upper East Side. Within 15 minutes the two had the contours of a deal, signing the menu to commemorate a provisional agreement. Together, BlackRock and Merrill Lynch Investment Managers would constitute a colossus with almost $1tn of assets under management. MLIM executives were divided on the acquisition. Some were relieved to be part of a more dynamic, standalone asset management company after Merrill's long neglect. Others chafed at what they perceived as BlackRock's arrogance. Although the diplomatic Schlosstein was tasked with leading the integration, Kapito in particular rubbed many people up the wrong way. Some former executives compare him to Mike ""Wags"" Wagner, the aggressive but loyal hatchet man of fictional hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod in the TV series Billions. Nonetheless, Fink has remained resolutely loyal to Kapito, for good reason, according to even some of his detractors. They highlight his ""maniacal"" focus on efficiency as a key reason for BlackRock's rise, and attribute some of the animus towards Kapito to the fact that unpopular decisions often fall to him, allowing Fink to rise above the fray. When it boils down to it, they are the inseparable yin and yang at the heart of BlackRock, the tall, bespectacled Fink who loves schmoozing and grand strategy and the aggressive, uncompromising master organiser Kapito. ""The biggest mistake you can make at BlackRock is believing you can ever play one off against the other. There's not a photon of daylight between them,"" observes one former BlackRock executive. ""Rob would be wholly unsuccessful without Larry, but what people don't realise is that Larry would probably be wholly unsuccessful without Rob. The two of them are like salt and pepper shakers. They are very different, but they go together."" Fink's mettle was tested soon after the MLIM acquisition. He initially downplayed the wider dangers of the subprime housing problem when it started to emerge in early 2007, telling the FT that the market was under ""a lot of stress"" but that he didn't see it exploding into something ""meaningful and more destructive to the overall housing market"". A BlackRock investment in New York's Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village ended up an embarrassing disaster. Yet the firm navigated the ensuing mayhem better than many other investment groups, thanks partly to the growth of its ""Solutions"" business, which had expanded far beyond just offering Aladdin to outside clients. Its expertise in analysing complex structured bonds had first been established in 1994, when General Electric asked it to value the assets on the balance sheet of Kidder Peabody, the venerable but struggling brokerage firm it owned. By the time the financial crisis erupted, the Solutions unit was a fully fledged financial advice group with deep expertise in the plumbing of markets. Everyone from Wall Street rivals to foreign central banks and the US government itself clamoured for help in analysing the toxic securities that had nearly brought the system crashing down. ""When we did Kidder Peabody, it was an X-ray machine,"" Rob Goldstein, a senior BlackRock executive, once told the FT. ""When we had the opportunity to work on the most recent crisis, it was an MRI machine."" BlackRock's prestigious mandates to help the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve sort out the detritus of the financial crisis prompted complaints about the company's proximity to power. The expanding reach of Aladdin also unnerved some regulators, who would go on to become increasingly concerned about so many different    investors using the same risk-analysis platform, and whether that might lead to a dangerous uniformity of views. But it was the 2009 deal to acquire Barclays Global Investors, and the supercharged growth that followed, that propelled Fink to the top of Wall Street. Behind the scenes, the acquisition of BGI was fraught. Over in San Francisco, where BGI was headquartered, the rankand-file view was that BlackRock consisted of a bunch of knuckle-dragging Wall Street bond traders who had built their business through acquisitions, not through the West Coast innovation, collegiality and brilliance that they thought was their hallmark. Ensuring that the biggest deal in asset management history didn't end up a monument to hubris was a daunting task. ""It made us a truly global firm, but it also crossed a Rubicon in the industry,"" says BlackRock's Mark Wiedman, who handled the integration, referring to the combination of BlackRock's traditional ""active"" investment strategies and BGI's dominant focus on ""passive"" index funds. ""This ignited deep, intense theological debates paralleled only by the wars of religion in the 16th century,"" he jokes. All told, the full integration took about three difficult years. Insiders estimate that well over half of BGI's top executives were fired or left over the period. ""It was an extraordinary exercise in the Machiavellian method,"" observes one former BGI executive. ""The prince [Fink] needed all the barons to commit to total loyalty, and basically killed off all the barons that wouldn't do so."" Nonetheless, the BGI purchase has proved a stunning success story in an industry that has more M&A debacles than there are car crashes in the Fast & Furious movie franchise. Its dominance is largely thanks to BlackRock supercharging BGI's existing franchise of index funds passive investment vehicles that simply track a market benchmark such as the FTSE 100 or S&P 500. BlackRock has, in effect, done for investing what Henry Ford did for the car, constructing a financial assembly line that churns out products for investors more efficiently than virtually anyone else. In June 2014, the prized iShares ETF business crossed the $1tn mark, which Wiedman celebrated with a party in London where he wore a ""trillion-dollar suit"" made from dollar-bill-patterned cloth, according to people familiar with the matter. Even that landmark is now a distant memory. Halfway through 2021, the iShares unit alone was managing more than $3tn. Today, BlackRock's profit margins are fatter than those of Apple or Google, and its stock market valuation is about $126bn, more than Goldman Sachs and greater than the combined values of its competitors TRowe Price, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, Janus Henderson, Schroders and State Street. The billionaire property investor Sam Zell has what people in finance sometimes refer to as ""fuck-you money"" wealth so vast they can pretty much do and say whatever they like. In January 2018, Zell took advantage of that to unload on BlackRock's founder. ""I didn't know Larry Fink had been made God,"" the irascible Zell told CNBC, complaining about the rising power enjoyed by big index fund providers over swaths of the equity market. ""I just wonder whether America is really ready for Vanguard and BlackRock to control the New York Stock Exchange, because that's what's happening,"" he added. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are by some distance the world's biggest purveyors of passive, index-tracking investment vehicles, whether tradi- tional benchmark-hugging mutual funds or ETFs that can be bought and sold throughout the day. The inexorable shift towards such funds has handed the industry's so-called Big Three enormous sway in many corporate boardrooms. Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School and Scott Hirst of Boston University estimated in a 2019 paper titled ""The Spectre of the Giant Three"" that the trio's combined average stakes in the 500 biggest listed US companies had vaulted from about 5 per cent in 1998 to more than 20 per cent. Their real power is even greater and growing. Given that many shareholders don't actually bother to vote at annual meetings, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street now account for about a quarter of all votes cast on average, which will rise to 41 per cent over the next two decades, the academics estimated. John Coates, a Harvard Law professor, has called this rising concentration of economic power ""a legitimacy and accountability issue of the first order"". In reality, calling it the Big Three is a misnomer. State Street's inclusion is the legacy of its invention of the ETF, and its size and growth rate is far more modest than BlackRock or Vanguard's. In practice, there is an emerging    duopoly, and BlackRock's pole position and Fink's willingness to throw its heft around more than Vanguard has made it a target across the political spectrum. Early last year, Fink announced that BlackRock would put sustainability at the heart of its investment decisions, embracing the industry trend of taking environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into account. But for those on the left, BlackRock's vows didn't go far enough. Even BlackRock's own former sustainability chief, Tariq Fancy, has lambasted the ESG trend as ""marketing gobbledegook"". Fancy argues that efforts such as BlackRock's are actually harmful, as they distract from the real work needed to address the climate crisis. Meanwhile, some on the right have made it a target too. US Senator Marco Rubio recently proposed a bill aimed at arresting the wave of ESG-oriented investing. Fink argues that taking ESG into account is simply good stewardship of clients' money, given the climate crisis. He also tells me that despite the size of BlackRock and its biggest rivals, asset management remains less concentrated than many industries such as technology or retailing. If there was consensus that his firm's size was having a deleterious effect on corporate governance, he says he could address it by divvying up holdings into separate, smaller legal entities, each with their own research and stewardship teams. ""If society believes this is going to be a big issue, it is solvable,"" Fink says. ""And I could still provide transparency, convenience and [low] pricing."" Yet even among some fellow financiers there is muttering about Black- Rock's growing influence. A host of former government officials work at BlackRock, and others have departed for plum jobs in the Biden administration. To some critics, BlackRock is the new Goldman Sachs, the investment bank once so influential it was sometimes labelled ""Government Sachs"". Does this mean that Fink's reign at the top of the financial ecosystem is in peril? Barring an epic shift in the political or financial winds it is hard to see what could throw BlackRock's growth into reverse, and those who know Fink do not sense he is slowing down. Now that his dream of someday becoming treasury secretary has faded, given Washington's bipartisan distaste for Wall Street tycoons, Fink could end up keeping his hands on BlackRock's tiller for years to come. When he gave a commencement speech to UCLA students in 2016, Fink revealed how the First Boston setback scarred him. ""I believed I had figured out the market, but I was wrong because while I wasn't watching, the world had changed."" The timely acquisition of BGI was a sign that he understood better than most how the investment industry was changing. He will need that nous more than ever as BlackRock juggles a host of interlocking but disparate challenges in the coming decade, from growing US-China tensions to climate change and the increasingly polarised sociopolitical landscape in the US. Even some of those who have fallen foul of his empire-building say that Fink is probably up to the task. But of the eight founders, only Fink, Kapito and Golub now remain in management, and past and present insiders wonder what will happen once Fink eventually leaves the company he founded just three decades ago. ""Larry was astonishing on the level of details he knew. I don't like him, but he's a phenomenal businessman, and he lives for BlackRock,"" observes one former senior executive. ""When he leaves it will be like when Alex Ferguson left Manchester United ... It is impossible to overstate how BlackRock's journey is the journey of a single man."" Robin Wigglesworth is the FT's global finance correspondent. This is an adapted extract from his book ""Trillions: How a Band of Wall Street Renegades Invented the Index Fund and Changed Finance Forever"", published by Penguin Random House on October 12 Today, BlackRock's profit margins are fatter than those of Apple or Google, and its stock market valuation is about $126bn 'My team and I felt like rockstars.

ca9c6c8d412edfa12cc1,2021-10-08,Hedge funds cash in on unwanted oil and gas stocks,"Financials. ESG pressure Discards from big institutions offer rich returns boosted by soaring prices for energy Hedge funds have been quietly scooping up unloved oil and gas stocks discarded by environmentally minded institutional investors and are now reaping big gains as energy prices surge. Managers of hedge funds in the US and UK have been betting that the eagerness of many big institutions to be seen to embrace environmental, social and governance standards means they are selling wholesale out of fossil fuel stocks, even though demand for some of these products remains high. ""It's such a great and easy idea,"" Crispin Odey, founder of London-based Odey Asset Management, told the Financial Times. ""They [big institutional investors] are all so keen to get rid of oil assets, they're leaving fantastic returns on the table,"" said Odey, whose European fund is up more than 100 per cent so far this year. The company has been building its position in oil and gas stocks this year and has sizeable stakes in groups including Aker BP, the Norwegian oil company, whose shares are up about 43 per cent, and Jadestone Energy, the Asia-Pacific-focused producer, which is up 44 per cent. Odey said he had also been providing financing for unlisted vehicles that are being set up by commodities companies specifically to buy up unwanted assets being sold off by the oil majors. The move away from fossil fuels by big institutions has often left hedge funds, which face fewer pressures to conform to ESG norms than mainstream fund companies, among the only buyers. This can present attractive opportunities, although it can leave them exposed to falls in energy prices or further selling by big investors. Alongside Odey's fund, Goldman Sachs's prime brokerage division, which provides a range of services such as stock lending and execution, recently told clients that energy stocks had had their biggest net buying by hedge funds since late February, according to a note seen by the FT. ""People don't understand how much money you can make in things that people hate,"" said Josh Young, managing partner and co-founder of Bison Interests, adding that his fund avoids the ""dirtiest companies"". Bison Interests has profited from positions in companies including Baytex Energy Corp of Canada and SandRidge Energy of the US, and is up 377 per cent this year before fees, according to a person familiar with the matter, ranking it as one of the world's top-performing funds. ""Many of these companies are trading at very low cash flow multiples and at very big discounts to the replacement value of their assets,"" said Young. ""More people are driving gas-powered cars and scooters than ever."" The pressure on institutional investors from climate lobby groups to stop funding fossil fuel companies has intensified markedly in recent years. Pension funds, charities, churches and other faith groups and universities,    which may own some stocks either directly or through funds they hold, are among those that have committed to selling out of such companies as a way of combating climate change and shifting investment towards more renewable forms of energy. DivestInvest, the climate activism group that pushes investors to make no new investments in the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies and to sell any such positions within three to five years, says it has received pledges from more than 1,300 organisations managing $14.5tn in assets. Hedge fund managers buying up these stocks argue that investment in areas such as oil and gas production is still badly needed, as highlighted by recent moves in the energy market. Oil prices hit their highest level in at least three years this week, while UK gas prices have more than quadrupled. Companies often use their revenues from oil and gas to fund a transition to cleaner energy, say hedge fund managers, and halting investment into these stocks hurts this process. ""The ESG guys are causing terrible problems,"" said Odey. ""They're ensuring price rises are not met by supply."" Another European-based manager said moves by big investors to stop backing fossil fuel companies may be ""counterproductive"", adding that the sector offers a ""huge investment opportunity"" for their fund. Renaud Saleur, a former trader at Soros Fund Management and Jabre Capital, who now heads Anaconda Invest, said the effect was particularly striking in Europe, where investors had embraced ESG concerns to a greater extent than in the US. ""In Europe, people have been more keen to blackwash the oil and gas industry. It's mere stupidity. This [sector] produces money to fund the energy transition,"" he said, adding that these investors were also pushing stocks in sectors such as electric vehicles and hydrogen to ""unsustainable levels"". He has backed companies including Sha- Maran Petroleum and Santos. Smaller energy stocks, which hedge funds often favour, have benefited from buying cheap oil and gas assets from the oil majors, which face investor pressure to divest from fossil fuels. But there are signs that oil majors may be growing wary of such sales. Earlier this year Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of Total, told the FT that selling assets to other producers that may be less mindful of ESG concerns was not a solution. ""Even if BP, Total and Shell divest from oil and gas it does not change anything,"" he added.

c6a989074cd734f2107c,2021-10-08,Nuclear power can help fill the energy gap,"This month Mike Hewitt, a former US naval rear admiral, is shuttling across the Atlantic to pitch a green venture to investors. Nothing unusual about that you might think: such projects are popular ahead of next month's COP26 climate talks in Glasgow. However, this particular environmental project, known as IP3, has an unusual twist: it is focused on nuclear power. More specifically, Rolls-Royce, the British engineering group, is organising a consortium to install more than a dozen so-called ""modular nuclear reactors"" (MRNs) across Britain. They hope to get £210m from the UK government to fund this, according to Hewitt. His group is also raising matching finance from private sources, including investors with ""environmental, social and governance"" (ESG) mandates. ""The traditional ESG criterion has kept nuclear power out [of their funds],"" he tells me. ""But we think this is changing."" Is this right? It is not clear yet since the plan is not officially in place. However the fact that IP3 is even attempting to make nuclear reactors part of an ESG pitch is a striking sign of the climate times ? and one which, in my view, should be welcomed. Until very recently, the word ""nuclear"" was toxic to most green activists and many politicians, both because of the pollution risks linked with spent nuclear fuel, and due to previous accidents at nuclear plants. Indeed, events such as the 1986 meltdown in Chernobyl, Ukraine or the 2011 tsunami at Japan's Fukushima plant have left such a legacy of fear that countries such as Germany have been shutting their existing plants, along with US states such as New York and California. Meanwhile, a row has broken out inside the team that has been drafting the EU's taxonomy for sustainable finance, which will help investors ensure projects are environmentally sound. The French government has lobbied for nuclear power to be included because it does not emit carbon (since France relies on nuclear for much of its electricity). But this has been blocked by Germany. Unsurprisingly, this makes ESG funds wary. Or as Bank of America observed in a recent research note: ""We have received feedback multiple times from a variety of environmentally conscious investors that they cannot invest in certain utilities due to nuclear exposure."" However, there are now two factors which could (and should) change this conversation. First, nuclear technology is shifting. Whereas 20th century reactors were so big and expensive that they required a decades-long commitment to the new generation of MNRs are smaller, cheaper and far more flexible. This means that they can be located in more convenient places, and ? crucially ? treated as a temporary or transitional energy source. Evangelists for nuclear power, such as Bill Gates, claim that such technological breakthroughs have also made plants far safer than before, with less pollution risk, because they can be run on recycled fuel, although these claims remain controversial. The second factor changing the conversation is a growing sense of realism ? or desperation ? about carbon emissions ahead of COP26. In an ideal world, there is (or should be) no question that the best way to slash emissions is to use renewable sources, such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power.    In the real world, however, renewables only account for a small slice of current energy sources and that is unlikely to change without dramatic innovations in battery storage and transmission systems. This miracle seems unlikely to occur any time soon. Thus the nasty choice confronting policymakers and environmental activists is this: should they swallow the risks of nuclear, at least temporarily, in order to cut carbon emissions? Or should they tolerate higher use of fossil fuels? If they want to keep global warming below 2 degrees, what the COP26 attendees face is not a beauty contest around the best energy choices, but an ""ugly contest"" to pick the least-bad energy mix. Personally, I favour the first option, using nuclear as a transitional option, even with the attendant risks, to cut the near inevitable rise in carbon emissions without it. As a report from the World Economic Forum notes, ""the contribution nuclear power can make to the energy transition lies in its ability to folinstall, low and assume the system costs generated by the intermittency of renewables"". In other words, it fills in gaps that renewables still (sadly) create. Those governments that continue to shun nuclear plants are haunted by the dirty secret that this move is likely to increase emissions. To cite one example, officials in New York privately tell me that closing their nuclear plant at Indian Point, while politically popular, will probably increase reliance on fossil fuel, something no one will admit publicly. But don't expect Western politicians to talk too frankly about this difficult choice, especially given that they face a ""Nimby"" ? Not In My Back Yard ? voter problem when it comes to nuclear plants. Hence the need to watch what those ESG funds are doing. If they start to accept that we live in a world of difficult energy trade-offs in the coming months, and fund nuclear, it may signal that the climate movement is also beginning to realise that we live in a world with fifty shifting shades of green. gillian.tett@ft.com The new generation of modular reactors are smaller, cheaper and far more flexible"
726ccbf0295055582942,2021-10-07,Health is wealth investors can no longer afford to ignore it,"The link between health and prosperity has been rammed home by the pandemic. In 2008, a Government-commissioned review found poor health cost the UK economy around £100bn per year. This year, the CBI estimated there was an eye-watering £300bn in lost economic output annually, excluding direct healthcare costs. In the time between these two reports, growth in life expectancy had stalled in the UK to a greater extent than in other developed countries, with the exception of Iceland and the US. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, life expectancy in parts of the country specifically the North East and the Midlands was in reverse. In the areas of England with the lowest healthy life expectancy, more than a third of 25 to 64-year-olds are economically inactive due to long-term sickness or disability. Talk to UK politicians about health, and they immediately think of the NHS or personal responsibility. Yet best estimates suggest that healthcare contributes at most 20 per cent to population health. So-called ""wider determinants"" low-quality insecure work, poverty, substandard housing, inadequate early years support, education, poor diet, smoking and air quality shape more than 80 per cent. Governments national and local have the power to address these root causes, and they do, to a greater or lesser extent. But investors and businesses have considerable agency over commercial health determinants, which are also significant. Consider that two-thirds of Brits are now overweight or obese. That trend, which has been rising in the UK since at least the 1980s, cannot be the result of a gradual loss of individual willpower to make healthy choices, nor changing biology. Rather, it reflects the changing context within which individuals make choices, such as the greater availability and marketing of cheap, unhealthy food. Governments have belatedly responded with measures such as the sugar tax and a forthcoming ban on junk food adverts on TV before 9pm. Investors, meanwhile, are increasingly active on the green agenda, but strangely silent on health. The subject is also largely absent from most asset managers' sustainability assessments. Many ethical or sustainability funds do not include healthrelated exclusions on tobacco, alcohol or gambling companies. British American Tobacco, oddly, was recently granted the third highest ESG rating in the FTSE 100 by one data provider. Investor inaction has allowed vast amounts of capital to remain available to some of the most health-damaging sectors, including companies reliant on insecure work and those which contribute most to air pollution. And while they may not listen to health experts, perhaps they will respond to consumers and clients. Recent surveys report UK public savers rate improving health as their top UN Social Development Goal (SDG) of interest, with 70 per cent saying this goal was important to them. Another survey found that 33 per cent of pension savers want their pensions to be divested from companies that do not pay the living wage. Overlooking health now comes with clear risks: companies visibly contributing to poor health outcomes risk higher costs or lower demand unless they change. Investors, too, risk stranded assets and lower demand from clients. The success of investors in pushing Tesco PLC to set targets to increase sales of healthy food provides an example of what is possible in the health arena with collaborative engagement.    There are other areas of health where similar action could deliver tangible benefits, from air pollution to the quality of work for the lowest paid. For the health of populations and portfolios ambitious investor stewardship on these issues must become the new normal.

2976df21b72bc5d30d77,2021-09-28,ETF fees blown higher as historical trend reverses ....................................................................................................171,"Twitter: @FTLex Nuclear power generated more than a sixth of the world's electricity at its peak. In the following quarter of a century, safety and cost concerns pushed its contribution down to a tenth. Now soaring fuel prices and the push to decarbonise are strengthening the case for a nuclear renaissance. Investors will be wary. Backing nuclear has been a bruising experience, particularly since the meltdown at the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011. That prompted Germany to force the closure of plants operated by four companies. The ensuing disputes were settled only this year with the payment of €2.8bn of compensation. The economics of nuclear power have also deteriorated. The cost of new reactors jumped even as the price of building gas and renewable generation fell. Budget overruns sparked crises at several groups. In 2017 Westinghouse Electric, then owned by Japan's Toshiba, filed for bankruptcy after costs escalated at four US reactors. ESG funds fret about safety, waste disposal and the impact of uranium mining. ESG funds are a lot less likely than others to hold shares in EDF, the utility with the most nuclear exposure in Europe, according to Barclays. Yet the merits of a reliable, if costly, source of low-carbon energy have been underlined by the recent rise in global gas prices. In Britain that coincided with a period of light winds, drawing attention to the intermittency of renewable energy. In China, strict carbon emissions targets and rising coal prices are posing a threat to economic growth. China's and other emerging nations' share of nuclear output will rise to almost one-third, up from 29 per cent in 2019, says the IEA. Nuclear plays a key part in the Biden administration's clean energy plan, while Britain's prime minister has talked nuclear up as part of his ""green industrial revolution"". Much must change if nuclear is to succeed. Developers need to cut costs and shorten schedules. Rolls-Royce seeks funding for a fleet of ""mini reactors"". Other innovative approaches include the sodium-cooled reactor of Bill Gates-funded start-up TerraPower. Above all, politicians must encourage a sensible price on emissions. That would put the capital costs of baseload nuclear power in clearer context. Its carbon footprint is similar to wind, lower than solar, and far lower than coal, albeit with radioactive waste thrown in."
c9e297ae4685fbbd53bb,2021-09-25,Gas crisis shows why we must stop demonising fossil fuels,"E arlier this week the online UK supermarket Ocado told its customers that it had ""limited ability"" to deliver ice cream to them. Why? Because the price of natural gas has soared. That has caused two of the UK's big industrial fertiliser plants to shut down, as natural gas is the feedstock for ammonia, which is used to make fertiliser. Since carbon dioxide is captured from ammonia production, this has hit the supply of CO2 in the UK. And that has led to a cut in the supply of dry ice that supermarkets use to keep food cool in their delivery vans. So no ice cream. We can live without ice cream. But what of the other effects? Abattoirs are short of the gas they need to stun animals, hospitals might not have the carbon dioxide they need for minor surgeries, and the nuclear industry is low on the gas they need for cooling. These things really matter. This mini crisis has been fairly quickly resolved, for now at least: the taxpayer is stepping in to subsidise a fertiliser factory for three weeks. However that doesn't mean you shouldn't worry. You should. This incident serves as a timely reminder of just how reliant we are on fossil fuels. Despite our optimistic enthusiasm for wind and solar power, one way or another oil and gas use is shot through every part of our economic and social lives. That will be the case for many decades to come. In his recently updated book There is No Planet B, Mike Berners-Lee lays out the challenge (and, perhaps inadvertently, the lack of a medium-term solution). When we talk about shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy of one kind or another, we aren't discussing taking the amount of energy we use now and producing that static amount in a different way. Instead our target is always on the move. The more energy we can get our hands on, the more we use even if our use of it becomes more efficient. We use three times as much energy as we did 50 years ago and at current growth rates that will soon double again. Think of this in terms of solar panels. Right now, says Berners-Lee, if we could figure out storage and transmission (which so far we haven't), we could meet all our global energy needs by covering 0.1 per cent of the world's land in solar panels. Keep expanding our energy use at 2.4 per cent a year (the 10- year average is 1.5 per cent but in 2018 it was 2.9 per cent) and in 300 years we will need every inch of land mass there is in every country in the world. In one sense this is a ridiculous way to look at it we live in a stunning age of innovation and the panels we use today will surely look amusingly archaic in a decade or two. Abattoirs and others can find another solution instead of gas. But you get the point: energy usage is going to keep rising, led by China, the US and India, while energy transitions tend to both take a very long time and never actually end. We just pile new sources on top of old. The world still uses much the same amount of traditional biomass (wood etc) as it did 100 years ago. Even after many years of efforts, coal, oil and gas still make up 80 per cent of our global energy mix, pretty much exactly the same number as a decade ago. We are running to stand still. This will change. But not as fast as you might like to think. In 2019, 33 per cent of our new power generation needs were met by renewable energy. That's a start. But 40 per cent were met by natural gas.    There's urgency here of course which might speed things up. But there is something else that might slow us down. It didn't take much to move people to fossil fuels they are relatively easy to extract, relatively easy to transport, hugely energy dense and efficient and, of course, cheap. Until their externalities were understood, who could possibly have objected? Our current transition is different: people and companies will switch not because the new sources are easier to access, cheaper or more energy dense but because regulation mandates that they must. Either way, the truth is that whether we like it or not our energy transition involves long term reliance on fossil fuels. That means that we should stop demonising them evangelising about ESG, following the trend to divest from shares in oil companies and kiboshing new projects with regulation, high financing costs (many banks are pulling back from the sector) and the like. Instead we should focus on making their extraction cleaner and more efficient while we wait for the engineering challenges around a renewables-led future to be solved. If we don't do this if we allow ourselves to be beguiled by the idea that solar is so advanced that we no longer need filthy fuels to have ice cream, we will find the future held back by needlessly expensive energy and almost certainly ice-cream free. Some reckon that the global population will gladly slash their energy use and pay a ""greenium"" for the energy they do use. I'd say anyone who believes that has never been on the customer services desk at Ocado, or asked someone in India whether they would like the same average living standard as the average European or, for that matter, received their latest gas bill.

11ed96131221acb17c59,2021-09-25,CMA acts to clean up greenwashing,"MORAL MONEY The UK's markets regulator is on the hunt for greenwashing. The Competition and Markets Authority this week published new standards for the possible control of businesses' eco-friendly claims. Industries including fashion, travel, food, beauty and cleaning products will be prioritised for scrutiny, the CMA said. And where there is clear evidence of consumer law violations, regulators might take action before the year end. As part of this, the CMA published hypothetical examples of business claims that could be misleading from bamboo wrapped around a plastic shampoo bottle, to ""organic"" jeans with only one-third of their cotton being organic. For years, businesses have marketed sustainability claims to profit from peoples' anxieties about pollution and global warming. And the onus has almost always been on consumers to verify what claims were legitimately green or not. But with the new standards, businesses would have to take on that responsibility. ""Any business that fails to comply with the law risks damaging its reputation with customers and could face action from the CMA,"" said Andrea Coscelli, CMA's chief executive. Businesses are taking the CMA's crackdown seriously. Danone, Nestle and SC Johnson were among the companies that wrote to the regulator about greenwashing. The Nappy Alliance, which represents manufacturers, warned the CMA about singleuse nappies marketed as ""biodegradable"", ""compostable"" or ""eco-friendly"". Consumers often think these can be tossed into a recycling bin, which can lead to the contamination of waste in recycling streams, the group said. The CMA's announcement came during London Fashion Week, an annual celebration that has increasingly drawn attention to the sector's sustainability problems. To kick off the event, two of the largest fast-fashion retailers set new commitments to environmental, social and governance goals after both had drawn scrutiny for ESG problems. Asos, a British ecommerce brand, pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions across the entire value chain by 2030, as well as being operationally carbon neutral by 2025. In June, the Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce said Asos, Boohoo.com and some other retailers had just 3 per cent of recycled synthetics in their products. Primark, another large fashion retailer, promised it would produce clothing using recycled or more sustainably sourced materials by 2030. As greenwashing scrutiny advances in the UK, litigation is already under way in the US. Coca-Cola is fighting a lawsuit that accuses it of deceptive advertising over its bottle recycling efforts. Coke has rejected the allegations in court filings. The lawsuit was brought by Earth Island, a California-based environmental activist group that also sued bottled water company Blue- Triton, alleging it falsely advertised sustainability statements. BlueTriton, formerly Nestlé's US water subsidiary, rejected Earth Island's claims.    Consumer groups generally are pressing for an end to an era of loose, eco-friendly advertising. But it still remains to be seen whether any companies will pay a serious price in the consumer market for questionable sustainability marketing. Patrick Temple-West ?

34308f5ae7b23f0245b4,2021-09-24,City Insider,"Andrew Lindsay A tough row to hoe The sharp rise in global energy costs has not been a crisis for everyone. For Andrew Lindsay of Telecom Plus, whose Utility Warehouse business is the UK's ninth-biggest energy supplier, it has been vindication. ""We've been here before,"" Lindsay, pictured, told City Insider. ""We've been patiently waiting for our opportunity."" Telecom Plus has an agreement with Eon whereby the German utility supplies energy at a permanent fixed discount to the UK's retail price cap and takes on all hedging risks. The deal did allow Utility Warehouse to be undercut by suppliers taking a more shortterm approach. But with soaring wholesale prices squeezing rivals out of the market, it is among the few still willing to take on new customers for cheaper tariffs than the price cap. Rising prices had exposed sector-wide ""systemic flaws"" but state intervention beyond stop-gap measures was unwarranted, said Lindsay, a former Goldman Sachs M&A banker who became Telecom Plus's chief executive in 2010. ""Energy markets are cyclical. We learned back in 2005 that you get wholesale price spikes. But everyone's conveniently forgotten about that,"" he said. ""The government is treading the right line here by not letting the incumbents muscle in and stifle competition, but equally not bailing out insolvent suppliers and prolonging the overdue and much-needed reset of unsustainable pricing practices."" Sands Capital Each-way accumulator A bid approach for bookmaker Entain is a big win for Sands Capital, the US investment group that emerged from nowhere three months ago to become its biggest shareholder. Virginia-based Sands Capital first revealed its Entain stake in June after crossing the 5 per cent UK disclosure threshold for overseas funds, having been buying stock since the third quarter of 2019. Its only other London punt of scale was in 2015 on online retailer Asos. US regulatory filings show that Sands Capital more than trebled its Entain stake over the second quarter of 2021 with the purchase of about 31m shares, then valued at about £500m. After DraftKings' bid approach for Entain, those shares are worth more than £850m. Whether Sands Capital can repeat the trick is another matter. In July its lead gambling analyst Davis Catlin left to join casino operator Las Vegas Sands (no relation). Ken Costa Blanca cheque The last days of the Spac craze have drawn out City grandee Ken Costa, who wants to carve out a niche in ethical estate planning for super-rich millennials. Alvarium Investments, the merchant bank Costa co-chairs, this week revealed plans to merge with US family office management specialist Tiedemann and reverse on to Nasdaq via the special purpose acquisition vehicle Cartesian Growth. The idea is to build a global wealth manager that concentrates on impact investment, ESG and innovation. ""There is a massive generational change taking place,"" he said.    ""Seventy trillion dollars are going to move from the boomers to the Zoomers in 10 years."" Next in line is ""a generation that doesn't just want to give its money to someone to invest. They want to do well and do good."" Costa said Alvarium took the Spac route because a public listing would make it easier to cut deals and add to its $60bn of assets under advisement. ""Consolidation is inevitable in this sector, globally,"" he said. ""To have cash and a listed security is a huge advantage."""
1302f16d5a67303d33f1,2021-09-22,'Green gilts' debut sees investors smash bidding record for UK government debt,"Fixed income The UK's inaugural ""green gilt"" sale was met with record demand yesterday, as the country belatedly joined a growing number of European governments selling bonds with proceeds earmarked for environmental spending. Investors queued up to buy the new 12- year bond, placing more than £100bn of bids the highest ever for a UK government bond sale according to insiders. The £10bn raised made it the largest sovereign green bond on record. The UK's Debt Management Office, the arm of the Treasury that handles bond issuance, plans to sell at least £15bn of green gilts this year, with a further sale scheduled for next month, as it launches one of the world's largest green borrowing programmes. The money raised by the bonds must be spent on projects including flood defences, renewable energy, or carbon capture and storage, in line with the green financing framework published by the government in July. The new bond, due to mature in July 2033, priced at a yield of 0.87 per cent. The slightly higher price that investors were willing to pay for the transaction meant this figure was 0.025 percentage points lower than the expected price for a typical conventional gilt, said Asif Sherani of HSBC, who worked on the deal. This ""greenium"", which will save £28m for the Treasury over the life of the bond, is the largest seen so far for a sovereign green bond, Sherani said. The UK has arrived relatively late to the market for green sovereign debt, despite intense lobbying from a fund management industry anxious to demonstrate its commitment to environmental, social and governance-focused investing known as ESG. Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Poland and Hungary are among European countries that have already sold green bonds. ""If you look at flows into ESG funds, they're accelerating,"" said Jim Leaviss, chief investment officer for public fixed income at M&G Investments. ""There's just been so much pent-up demand for this."" DMO chief Robert Stheeman had expressed reservations, telling the Financial Times last year that unless investors were prepared to pay a premium for green gilts, they might end up poor value for money for UK taxpayers. Since then, green bonds have generally begun to price at slightly lower yields than their conventional counterparts for example, in Germany's first green bond sale a year ago locking in a small saving for issuers. ""Until that value for money argument was obvious, it didn't make sense for [the UK DMO] to come into this market,"" said Sherani. UK chancellor Rishi Sunak said the cash raised would be used to finance ""vital green government projects"". He has previously said green government debt could eventually become a pricing reference for companies that want to sell green bonds of their own.    The banks handling the sale were Citigroup, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase. 'If you look at flows into ESG funds, they're accelerating. There's been so much pent-up demand'"
3b42596d14d25727ce59,2021-09-21,SSE/Elliott: split verdict,"Twitter: @FTLex Energy suppliers already have plenty of excitement from surging gas prices. The atmosphere at SSE is even more fevered. Activists want the FTSE 100 utility to split off its renewable energy business. SSE denied reports yesterday that such a decision was imminent. Instead, the company said it would update shareholders with new plans at its half-year results in November. Elliott has been banging the breakup drum loudest. The tough US hedge fund would like to see a clean break, preferably through a spin-off. That would separate the group into a fast-growing clean energy unit and a slower growing but cash-rich electricity distributor. In theory, the renewable division would receive a higher rating outside the deadening wrapper of a big utility. Elliott's plan has some merit but exposure to fast-changing sentiment on renewables could make the trick hard to pull off. Pure renewable energy companies such as Denmark's Orsted command high multiples. On conservative assumptions, SSE's renewable energy assets, which include onshore and offshore wind as well as hydro, may be worth at least one-tenth more than their implicit value in SSE. Recent deals support a higher price still, valuing SSE's power networks business in line with PPL's UK electricity distribution division, which was acquired by National Grid. The renewables unit would then be trading at just 8.4 times ebitda, thinks Deepa Venkateswaran at Bernstein. That is still little more than half the multiple Orsted trades at. Such ratings look ephemerally high to sceptics, however. Renewable energy stocks have been drifting lower this year. They have the benefit of plentiful ESG-targeted funding. Even so, their renewables projects may cost more to deliver than all that ready capital implies. Growing doubts are reflected in a one-third drop in Orsted shares this year. A spin-off by SSE would be a bet that renewables can maintain their edge. Another option would be to redirect some of SSE's dividends to fund faster rollout of renewables. That would be a safer if less exciting strategy in the long run."
908b44b7854b9a305aad,2021-09-20,Robots are in a new phase and Cathie Wood's Ark is betting on it,"A hefty bet by Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Space Exploration fund on a 100-year-old Japanese company; a trade show of enormous, growling mining vehicles in Las Vegas; Soft- Bank's Masayoshi Son doing his best to foist the word ""Smabo"" on planet Earth from the deck of a pretend star cruiser. It is, in some respects, a great time to be a robot. The flashiest of these three signals was always likely to come from Son a rare Japanese business leader with the brazenness to celebrate defeat as triumph. He did this during the opening address last week at SoftBank World, an annual jamboree for clients of his technology conglomerate. Son's topic was robots, which was a courageous choice considering the humiliating retirement a few months back of SoftBank's flagship automaton, Pepper, the company's slashed investment in Boston Dynamics and the absence of any Japan robotics investments by the $100bn Vision Fund. Braver still was to begin the speech, which saw Son superimposed on to the interior of a Kubrickesque spaceship, with a slide of Pepper slumped in defeat. Time to learn and move on from these primitive toys, ran the message, and to fight even harder for a future of AI-turbocharged smart robots, or Smabo, as few other than Son are likely to call them. Despite his zeal the speech was not an upbeat hour. Japan's most prominent tech guru clearly fears that the country, for all its reputation and expertise, is in danger of missing a starring role in our Smabo destiny unless it acts more quickly than it currently is. ""We need to have more than just the good old days,"" he said, chilling the fake starscape with the message that a nation's technologically pioneering past is no guarantee of a future. A contrast with these misgivings, though, has been the hearty conviction with which Cathie Wood, the chief executive of Ark Invest and one of the world's most closely watched investors, has staked her faith in Japan's ability to lead a tech-centric global industrial revolution. She has done this through a substantial investment in Komatsu, a company whose diggers, dump trucks and dozers heavily populate the world's mines and construction sites. The stock, as of last week, is the seventh most heavily-weighted stock in Ark's Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (with twice the weighting of its US rival Caterpillar), and, in what some see as a greater stretch, the eighth in Ark's Space Exploration and Innovation ETF. Long-term watchers of Komatsu may guess what Wood has seen in the company. It is not a robot-maker in any conventional sense, but a consistent pioneer in the business of empowering vast machines with the kind of communications, data-gathering and dataprocessing tools that make their operations more efficient now and could ultimately lead to many of them becoming human-free. Or, in all practical senses, robots. As it has honed these skills, Komatsu has pushed further and faster than its rivals into rolling-out autonomous dump trucks, pre-excavation surveillance drones and the first generation of what it calls ""smart construction"" sites where automation will ultimately end the need for humans. The company has not, to date, said much about space exploration.    At a conference hosted by Mizuho this month, Wood praised Komatsu's aggressive approach to autonomous technology, and provided a telling glimpse of her thinking. The Ark space fund, she said, involves not just orbital but suborbital space, which includes the drones that Komatsu is increasingly making a permanent feature of domestic construction sites. ""Robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence. Those are all being embraced by Japan,"" she said. Komatsu, notes Edward Bourlet, an analyst at CLSA, has also made an important shift of tone. Last week's MinExpo in Vegas is the biggest of the industry showcases and has traditionally been taken by Komatsu as an opportunity to present the latest mechanical colossi in its portfolio. This time, pitching its wares at a mining industry under huge ESG-investor related pressure to be greener, Komatsu was selling a story focused far more on the efficiencycentred software behind its mammoths. What Son, Wood and Komatsu all appear to have grasped is that robots, as a concept and a focus of the most valuable effort, are entering a distinct new phase. Success is now defined more by context than capability. Pepper waving its articulated arms at shop customers is not really a robot but, when it eventually happens, a driverless dump truck politely making way for an autonomous excavator in a human-free mine will be. leo.lewis@ft.com It is not a conventional robot-maker but a pioneer in the business of empowering vast machines"
902490c42a689ef2f945,2021-09-20,Why the 'S' of ESG proves so troublesome for rating services,"Letters It has been investment industry practice to carefully interrogate the methodologies used by rating services to assign environmental, social and governance grades to companies, and to determine the validity of a process based on the intricacies of the system used. But what if instead we focused on the output of those processes? The MSCI ESG system (""MSCI chief: Push to standardise ESG ratings is 'misplaced'"", Moral Money, FT.com, September 3) currently assigns ExxonMobil a BBB rating, which is high average, while drugmaker Moderna has earned a BB rating, which is between average and high average. It's obvious this difference can't be on the basis of ""E"", or environmental protection. In addition it's a little hard to believe that a company that has been funding suppression and denial of climate science for decades could possibly deserve a high governance score. So ""G"" should not be the basis for the difference. So that leaves us with ""S,"" the social aspect. For this, let's leave the climate elephant in the room aside and focus on human health. Combusting fossil fuels results in pollution causing approximately 10m premature deaths worldwide every year, which is about four times the number of premature deaths caused by Covid-19 in 2020. Meanwhile, Covid-19 vaccinations are estimated to have prevented 279,000 deaths and 1.25m hospitalisations in the US alone up to July 1 2021. ExxonMobil is not the only culprit in fossil fuel pollution and Moderna is not the only vaccine maker, but their relative impacts on human wellbeing are clear. It is both sad and humorous that if my firm, Green Alpha, in any of our strategies were to sell Moderna and buy ExxonMobil our portfolio-level ESG rating would go up. Another biotech, Bluebird Bio, which has made accessibility and affordability of genomic therapeutics a cornerstone of its business, isn't rated by MSCI ESG at all, so owning that would lower an average ESG score as well. As asset managers, we must ask ourselves: what could possibly be of greater social value than striving to preserve human life? If saving lives rather than causing deaths isn't reflected in a company's ESG rating, what is the purpose of the ""S"" in ESG at all?

15fbf304c933ebc3e37c,2021-09-18,Engine No 1 forges new corporate ESG scoring system,"Engine No 1, the activist hedge fund that won three seats on ExxonMobil's board this year, is jumping into the business of scoring companies on ESG issues. This week, Engine No 1 published its methodology for measuring companies by various ESG metrics. Many of the specific criteria are proprietary and not public. However, the group said it would aim to use the metrics to measure issues such as the impact of burning diesel and highlight the benefit of cash services for low-income people, for example. ""We put [the ESG metrics] into dollars and cents and we flow it into a financial model, and that model influences everything we do,"" said Jennifer Grancio, Engine No 1's chief executive officer. She said the group had already built this scoring system for large companies in the US. It would be applied to the firm's active and passive investing, she said. The firm argues its methodology gives investors dollar values for unappreciated positive or negative consequences from a company's behaviour. ""We would like to turn the industry away from separating ESG analysis from other financial and operational analysis,"" Engine No 1 said. Rather, the firm aims to shift the focus to a company's value creation or destruction of shareholder value. Companies will need to take Engine No 1's methods seriously or risk a potential activist campaign. The firm has talked to Chevron's board in recent weeks. Grancio said the firm was ""working with a number of companies"" to improve ESG criteria. ""We are being very careful on the back of the work we did at Exxon not to be portrayed as everything we are doing is activist,"" said Grancio. ""Most of what we are doing will not be."" The ESG scoring will also be incorporated into the voting policies for Engine No 1's exchange-traded fund (ETF). In June, the firm launched an ETF with an aim to drive environmental and social progress at large US companies. Voting on board directors and shareholder proposals at companies' annual general meetings will be a key tool to drive change, Engine No 1 has said. The ETF has seen its assets under management grow from $100m in June to $184.9m as of September 15. Patrick Temple-West ? To read more ESG news, visit FT.com/moral-money"
1e6492932da30eabea05,2021-09-18,Belize offers green incentive to international bondholders,"Fixed income. Debt restructuring Covid-hit Caribbean nation's buyback deal includes funding for coral reef conservation Belize is inching towards a deal with international bondholders after admitting that it cannot afford to pay back its debt and is counting on an unusual asset to help: its coral reefs. Earlier this month, the Caribbean nation, its tourism-heavy economy ravaged by the pandemic, agreed to buy back its only international bond from investors at a huge discount, using cash lent by the Nature Conservancy, a USbased environmental group. As part of the deal, Belize will pre-fund a $23.4m endowment to support marine conservation projects on its coastline, home to the world's second largest barrier reef. Some more investors still need to agree to the scale of the buyback discount before the deal is done. But if Belize can achieve the approval it needs on this $530m bond, the country could secure the first green-tinged debt restructuring, capitalising on the hunger among big fund managers to demonstrate their commitment to environmental, social, and governance-driven investing so-called ESG. Investors and advisers say the agreement could serve as a template for future restructuring talks, in which cash-strapped nations use the promise of environmental conservation to drive a harder bargain in effect creating a mechanism for investors in rich countries to pay poorer nations to protect the natural world. ""We live in a world where many institutional investors profess ESG sensibilities,"" said Lee Buchheit, the veteran sovereign debt restructuring lawyer who is advising the Belizean government. ""In any restructuring things always get tight when you get down to the last few pennies. We were hoping the environmental aspect would sweeten the transaction."" The buyback operation, which is offering investors 55c for every dollar of debt they hold, needs the support of a further quarter of bondholders. But a group of investors led by GMO, Abrdn, and Greylock Capital, representing half of the bondholders, has already given the scheme its blessing. Carlos de Sousa, a portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management a member of this group holding around 10 per cent of the bond said the proposal chimed with his firm's focus on ESG. ""Even though 55 is not the most amazing recovery value, we like the deal,"" he said. ""To think that we are contributing to saving the second biggest coral reef in the world is certainly a positive. It makes you somewhat less inclined to push for 60."" Cecely Hugh, investment counsel at Abrdn, said the marine endowment ""definitely makes the offer more attractive"". For Belize, whose debt stands at 133 per cent of GDP despite restructuring its borrowing five times over the past 15 years, the deal offers the chance to mend its reputation as a serial defaulter. Ocean conservation is crucial to the country's economy, with 40 per cent of output coming directly or indirectly from tourism and one in 10 workers employed in the fishing sector.    Conventional debt restructuring processes left any savings to be spent or misspent as the debtor government saw fit, said Belizean prime minister John Briceño, often leading to a cycle of ""overborrowing followed by a disagreeable purging through a debt restructuring, followed by another borrowing binge and yet another purging"". In this case, he said, ""Belize's pending offer attempts to break this cycle by channelling a portion of the debt relief into an investment in the Belizean economy that will result in benefits to Belize and to the planet"". Belize's deal is not the first time ESG has cropped up in restructuring talks. Last year, a group of investors pushed for the inclusion of ESG criteria in Ecuador's debt swap, which would potentially have led to payouts on the country's new bonds being linked to its ability to hit environmental targets aligned with the Paris climate agreement. Some holders of bonds issued by the Argentine province of Buenos Aires also pushed for an ESG-friendly restructuring earlier this year. Although neither attempt bore fruit, Belize's advisers took note. ""That sentiment is precisely what we were targeting,"" said Buchheit. Fund managers say restructuring talks provide a unique opportunity to raise their ESG concerns with governments, which are typically less susceptible to investor pressure than companies. ""Engagement has always been a very tricky area with sovereigns compared to corporates,"" said Yerlan Syzdykov, global head of emerging markets at Amundi, which was involved in the restructurings in Ecuador and Buenos Aires. ""But if you are already involved in a negotiation, you can try to discuss the direction of development with regards to sustainability goals."" Not all investors are on board with such schemes. Hedge funds, for example, were typically concerned with ""maximising recovery value over anything else"", Syzdykov said. Even so, he expected ESG to feature increasingly in debt negotiations. ""The grand idea here is rich countries or investors representing mostly rich countries should be able to help poorer countries pay for the transition,"" he added. In 2013 Ecuador abandoned plans to persuade rich countries to pay it not to drill for oil in the rainforest after the scheme hatched by former president Rafael Correa pulled in just $13m. Debt restructuring talks potentially offer a new mechanism to achieve a similar goal, said de Sousa. ""The Belize deal offers an example of how sovereigns can monetise the protection of the environment,"" he added. 'To think that we are contributing to saving the second biggest coral reef in the world is certainly a positive'"

4bb205e10cfc7437a165,2021-09-16,Activist alliance can push French boards over ESG,"The world is grateful to AstraZeneca for its contribution to fighting Covid-19. But that did not stop its shareholders giving it a bloody nose in May when asked for their verdict on the latest pay package for the company's chief executive. Almost 40 per cent of them voted against it a level that is enough for the press to call it an ""investor revolt"". The board will have to think hard about potentially holding back from such apparent largesse next year. It is a somewhat different state of affairs at French companies, where shareholders can protest vehemently against the boss's remuneration and the vote is simply dismissed by the company or presented as though everything is fine. Take Scor, the insurer where CIAM has a stake, for example. About 44 per cent of shareholders opposed chair and chief executive Denis Kessler's remuneration at its last annual meeting. But its board is not likely to feel under the same pressure as AstraZeneca. In the US and UK, no company is safe from the attentions of activist investors. But in France, and many other continental European jurisdictions, the business elite feels relatively secure; public company directors are more dismissive towards activists and engaged shareholders. Too many board members are old school friends or belong to the same clubs, and are therefore reluctant to side with activists against their pals. Such attitudes help explain why activist investors are only just beginning to be taken seriously on the continent, and why native European activists have a growing role to play. The best way to combat this attitude is to pursue change at annual meetings shareholders should not systematically vote in favour of directors' appointments. When we ran a campaign at Suez, the French utility, for example, following its implementation of a poison pill designed to prevent a takeover by Veolia, we prepared resolutions to change eight of the 14 directors to put pressure on the company to engage in bid talks. French boards' insulation is starting to weaken. In 2020, there were seven activist campaigns launched in France, according to a report from Lazard, the investment bank. (To put that into perspective, there were 82 campaigns in the US and 21 in the UK.) Perhaps the most notable recent case is Danone, owner of Evian mineral water and a company that has previously enjoyed support from its government. Activist shareholders forced it to change its chief executive this year after a period of underperformance. In this case, the chief executive had been a strong advocate of sustainability issues. But in general, one reason activist campaigns are important in Europe are environmental, social and governance concerns. With traditional long-only shareholders, there sometimes seems to be a mismatch between their official policies on ESG and the way they vote. They can appear to favour their relationship with management over consistently supporting ESG best practice, particularly when performance is good. But we think that activism aimed at improving companies' behaviour in relation to ESG issues will also improve their value.    It is time that institutional shareholders understood that they are on the same side as activists on ESG issues. One thing that might be done to improve things is to scrap the so-called Florange Law, which automatically assigns double voting rights to French shares after two years of holding. This law disproportionately benefits traditional, long-only institutional investors. While Florange prevails, it counters reform efforts. While we have mainly focused our ESG efforts on governance, we increasingly see social and environmental factors becoming the catalysts for change. The range of players pushing for these things extends beyond shareholders to non-governmental organisations. We have been exploring the idea of working with such entities to highlight issues at companies where we are invested. We suspect this could become standard for engaged shareholders. The oil majors have already come under sustained pressure from NGOs to do more to change their ways by developing sources of renewable energy, but this is just the start. More European companies, not just in demonised industries, are likely to feel the forces of change. An alliance of activist shareholders and social/environmental activists will be hard for cosy boards to ignore. Catherine Berjal is co-founder of asset manager CIAM.

34c2aa218be4251c2ef2,2021-09-16,Investor activism cannot fix Unilever's trust deficit,"T he collective noun for analysts is a consensus. Few other professions can find such virtue in groupthink. Take Unilever. As an investment, Unilever has been dead money since the arrival of Alan Jope as chief executive in 2019 and for nearly two years beforehand. Confidence has been eroded by Jope's fondness for talking about purpose rather than profit, along with a badly bungled sales warning in his first year. Yet twice as many sellside analysts still rate the maker of Marmite and Dove soap a buy as a sell, as they always have. Unilever's pandemic underperformance has made life increasingly uncom- fortable for its fan club. Just one of 14 brokerages tracked by Refinitiv kept a sell rating through the early 2020 trough, from which Unilever has rallied just 7 per cent. That compares with a 36 per cent rebound for the FTSE 100, of which Unilever is the third biggest constituent. It also lags far behind competitors such as Nestle (up 27 per cent) and Procter & Gamble (up 42 per cent). In response, some analysts are calling to a higher power. Recent notes identify investor activism as the quickest way to wrest Unilever from a two-decade low relative to consumer staples peers. The prayer is for a lightning bolt similar to Kraft Heinz's hostile bid in 2017, which briefly focused the mind of Jope's predecessor Paul Polman on shareholders rather than stakeholders. Activism was a question of when not if, Exane BNP Paribas told clients this week, because Unilever was ""too good an asset to be left to continue to flounder"". At the root of the speculation is the India subsidiary Hindustan Unilever. Its majority stake in the £64bn-valued unit accounts for nearly half Unilever's market value, up from a fifth a decade ago. Hindustan is separately quoted, as are the Indonesia and Nigeria subsidiaries, so investors have a clear measure of how valuations diverged between developed and emerging markets. Barclays estimates that the sum-of-the-parts group discount has widened from 13 per cent at the time of Kraft's bid to 25 per cent. The traditional Unilever break-up theory involves splitting food from soap, which would require unpicking nearly two decades of work to integrate supply chains and offices. Dividing geographically might be less disruptive since management is already arranged that way. Exane estimates that if both sides of Unilever were valued in line with peers, even allowing for a few extra operational costs the stock would be worth nearly double its current value at £78.10. Separation alone would do little, however. Investors also need to regain confidence in a developed world business that last year provided more than 40 per cent of revenue, yet by some measures is valued at less than zero. Jope has to take at least some of the blame, having fudged margin guidance twice this year on top of the 2019 warning, yet consensus forecasts have hardly budged. Unilever's weak share price belies an operational performance that has been no worse than the peer average; measured by market share it might even be better.    Could an activist seek to remove Jope? Wanting a chief executive sacked would be unusually aggressive, particularly for a mainstream fund capable of putting up the £3bn or thereabouts needed to gain leverage. It would also be a long shot: no board would want to jettison an ESG champion so soon after his appointment based on outside pressure alone. Activists tend to favour easy wins. Elliott's public campaign against Glaxo- SmithKline and Third Point's tilt at Prudential proposed nothing much that was outside the board's previous thinking. An attack on Unilever would have more in common with ValueAct's long and fruitless involvement with Rolls-Royce, whose perpetual restructuring made its efforts like pushing a blancmange. Unilever's problems have largely been around presentation. An unpopular chief executive and a glacial transformation programme give activists an opportunity to force some headlines but making real change will test any conventional investment horizon. For now, expectations of a break-up look like wishful thinking. bryce.elder@ft.com An attack would have more in common with ValueAct's fruitless Rolls-Royce involvement"
fa66230ae3584db5f455,2021-09-14,How the Greens embraced business,"If, as expected, the eco-party forms part of any coalition government in Berlin, it will demand companies set net zero targets. But the movement must learn how to make its goals economically palatable. A nnouncing her campaign as the Green party's first-ever candidate for chancellor in April, Annalena Baerbock did not start her speech talking about rescuing rainforests or endangered animals. Instead, she offered to help save German business. Baerbock's ""pact with industry"", aimed at supporting the country's businesses through the climate change transition, reflects how much her party's relationship with the corporate world has changed. Not so long ago, most Green party politicians ignored business and were ignored by it. But, ahead of Germany's pivotal September 26 election, rarely a week goes by without Baerbock speaking to a captain of industry. ""The markets of the future will be climate-neutral,"" she told the party conference in her first campaign speech. ""The question is not whether this will happen, but who will do it best. I want [Germany] to be at the forefront."" In the popular imagination, the Greens may spark memories of rabblerousing protesters outside nuclear plants, or sweater-knitting hippies. But a three-year reckoning process means the eco-party and German business are both cautiously changing their stance. The relationship is central to the Greens' pitch that they are fit to lead Europe's largest economy when Angela Merkel ends her 16 years at the helm. Isabell Wolfgramm of the Federation of German Industries says it shows how the relationship has changed: ""Ten years ago, we could never have imagined the Greens proposing a pact between industry and politicians."" Heightened consumer concerns over climate change have forced businesses to engage with the Greens. And the growth in ESG investing has made shareholders much more active in pushing environmental change on to companies. During the 2017 campaign, ""if you as a Green politician rang a company up, they would say: 'Don't come now maybe after the election',"" says Oliver Krischer, deputy chair of the Green parliamentary group. ""Now, I can't fit in all the appointments."" For some businesses, it is a true conversion. Others are grappling with political reality. In 2017 the Greens attracted 8 per cent of votes, but are set to more than double that support this time round. The party's chances of claiming the chancellery are slim. They are third in the polls, with the centre-left Social Democrats now ahead of Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats. But there is a strong likelihood that they will enter the next coalition government, and climate neutrality achieving net zero emissions will top their agenda. They propose a €500bn infrastructure spending spree over 10 years, plus Baerbock's ""pact,"" which would ask businesses to sign a contract for government funding in exchange for adopting sustainable models. To do this, the Greens want to relax Germany's constitutionally enshrined restriction on new borrowing, the socalled debt brake, putting them at odds with the fiscally conservative CDU and SPD. Yet a future coalition would have to engage with Green proposals which are bold, but not unstudied.    For months, leading Green politicians met chief executives, economists, finance ministers and central bankers in preparation for the campaign. The process, says Danyal Bayaz, finance minister in the Green-led state of Baden-Württemberg, taught the party the necessity of making their goals economically palatable to business. ""Businesses are very willing to transform their companies [for climate neutrality] ... But, and it's an important but, it has to be a profitable business case for them,"" he says. ""This is an idea that has been sucked into the DNA and thinking of the Green party."" No longer enemies The model for Germany's national Greens is the country's prosperous southern state of Baden-Württemberg. A heartland of the car industry, it was also the first German region with a Green-led government. The conservative state had been a CDU stronghold since the end of the second world war. But the Greens gained power almost by fluke in 2011, after the disaster at Japan's Fukushima reactor sparked a backlash against nuclear power, long championed by the CDU, and it lost control of the state. A decade later, the Greens are still in power, partly due to the popularity of their local leader, Winfried Kretschmann, an avuncular septuagenarian who speaks in the thick local dialect. But it is also down to local pragmatism. Central to this quest to better understand business was Fritz Kuhn, a silverhaired founding member of the 40-year-old Greens, and former mayor of Stuttgart. Living in a state where the car industry employs one in every 10 workers, he says, forced him to think about how to combine environmental and economic interests if the party was going to survive and even thrive. ""We can't think in terms of enemies,"" Kuhn says. ""Enemies have to be fought. Partners have to be convinced."" For Kuhn, this process began in the mid-1980s. He requested meetings with businesses across the country, from family Mittelstand companies to Siemens and Volkswagen. He came away from those talks arguing that unless they properly confronted climate change, many companies would lose out in the next cycle of business innovation. Yet, Kretschmann's appointment as Baden-Württemberg's premier in 2011 was tough. Other states tried to capitalise on the anxieties of businesses faced with the prospect of a local government run by the Greens. ""One [state] took out ads saying: 'Entrepreneurs, you're better off coming to us',"" says former aide Rudi Hoogvliet who now represents the region in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament. After Kretschmann was quoted in the mass circulation newspaper, Bild, as saying he wanted fewer vehicles, the chair of one major carmaker rushed to the politician's office to demand an explanation. Kretschmann insisted his point was misrepresented, and that he only cared about reaching zero emissions. ""The chief executive said: 'Oh well, zero emissions is also my goal',"" Hoogvliet says. ""That one sentence turned into a conversation."" For years, the Green-led government in Baden-Württemberg struggled to make progress with the carmakers. Enjoying a healthy demand, driven by consumers in China, they made little progress towards sustainability targets proposed by Kretschmann. It was not enough, say some Green politicians privately, that companies knew that change was needed. There had to be a cost attached to motivate them. That came in the form of Germany's ""Dieselgate"" scandal, when carmakers were discovered in September 2015 to have manipulated their engines to cheat on emissions scores. In the aftermath, the industry began to look more seriously at electric vehicles. ""That's the big step that the automotive industry had to take,"" says one car company executive. In return, businesses wanted the Greens to recognise that major industries needed support, and that if regulations pushed them to relocate to other countries with looser emissions policies, it wouldn't help the climate.""[The Greens] have started to see us not as part of the problem, but part of the solution,"" says the executive. In 2017, the Greens in Baden-Württemberg launched a ""strategic dialogue"" to expand the production of electric vehicles. They brought in not just carmakers and suppliers, but academics and civil society too. ""Our idea was not to make Baden-Württemberg the most climate neutral place in the world,"" says Hoogvliet. Instead, he says that his state, which produces 0.3 per cent of global emissions, can have a far bigger impact by focusing attention on successful collaboration between Greens and business. ""We want to demonstrate that an industrial region can pursue a coherent climate protection policy that works in favour of the economy,"" he adds.    One concrete development of those talks is a joint venture, half-funded by the state, between Porsche and battery maker Custom Cells to create an electric race car. Torge Thönnessen, the start-up's chief executive, says his ambition is to develop longer-lasting and faster-charging battery cells than competitors such as Tesla, while reducing their carbon footprint. ""Their goals haven't necessarily changed, but the [Greens] have become less radical,"" he says. ""They will aim not for revolutionary, but evolutionary development."" Listening campaign Baerbock and her co-leader Robert Habeck have encouraged the national party to follow Baden-Württemberg's lead. And while not all members support the move, most celebrate the pair for bringing the party into the mainstream. Even left-leaning dissenters are keeping quiet, in the hope that the shift will get the party which has seen membership jump more than 10 per cent to 120,181 over the past six months into government. One of the first things the party leaders did when they took control in 2018 was to enlist the help of members with financial expertise, like Bayaz, the regional finance minister, who worked at Boston Consulting Group before entering politics. Bayaz began inviting financial experts and economists to speak. At the same time, the party co-leaders began a ""listening tour,"" with Habeck focusing on regional finance ministers and central bankers while Baerbock targeted business and industry leaders. In April, Baerbock was ranked as the most popular party leader among chief executives polled by Wirtschafts Woche, at 26 per cent approval. Her support subsequently fell away following media reports that she embellished her CV and was accused of plagiarism. Yet, even those sceptical of the Greens' business conversion agree the outreach was successful. ""Baerbock earned respect with the way she engaged with business leaders,"" says Matthias Berninger, a lobbyist at pharmaceutical company Bayer, and a former Green politician. ""They have done a good job ... not just talking about business, but talking to business."" Like nearly every other executive interviewed, he remains suspicious the Greens will introduce emissions regulations and wealth taxes that could stifle companies. Bayaz admits additional regulation would be an important aspect of Green party policy, but says it is necessary to encourage innovation. Several Green party leaders say that after holding frank conversations in private, they are often disappointed to then see their policies criticised by the same executives. ""Some of the challenges the Greens are facing aren't because they're doing the wrong thing,"" one executive says. ""It's because there are a lot of people who are basically partisan in the way they look at things. ""They will support the CDU ... no matter what."" But that is slowly changing. It is no longer surprising to find business leaders voting Green. ""The companies have changed,"" says Kuhn. ""Today, the business community is much more ecologically conscious than the CDU."" No room for compromise Critics, including some progressive businesses, wonder whether the Greens have gone too far, conceding too much in return for too little. They point out that Baden-Württemberg, despite being Green-led, has achieved less than 35 per cent renewable energy usage far below neighbouring Rhineland Palatinate or even conservative-led Bavaria. At the Fondium foundry, in the town of Singen near Germany's southern border, co-founder Achim Schneider points to a cupola where molten iron sputters out in a cascade of orange sparks. Fondium produces its iron cast work, mostly for German carmakers, by using a coal-based firing method that requires as much power each year as the entire city of 45,000 people. He could make this firing process electric, but the state power grid needs a much higher percentage of renewable energy for that to be ecologically viable. ""Otherwise, our footprint would get worse by double, which is ridiculous,"" he says. ""This needs to be understood by politicians including the Greens."" The Greens in Baden-Württemberg say they have struggled to move quicker due to conservative governing partners and because the state was more reliant on nuclear power than others charges their critics dismiss as evading the party's primary goals. For 11 years, Paul Sigloch was a Green party member in the region, but he recently quit to help form Klimaliste, a group pushing a tougher climate agenda. The state Greens ruled with the SPD between 2011 and 2016, he says, and could have pushed more rigorous climate policies. He worries the same could happen now nationally.    ""You can't say, 'we'll make compromises here, compromises there',"" he adds. ""There are no compromises. This is natural science, this is fact."" Green leaders have invited other environmental activists, including those from Fridays for Future, who have been critical of the shift in position, to discuss their approach. They argue there is no point imposing policies just for them to be rejected not only by businesses, but the largely conservative voter base. ""We're basically trying to square a circle,"" Hoogvliet says. He may have a point. Nearly every person interviewed from business for this story said they hope to see the Greens in government just not leading it. Adds Schneider: ""I'm a little bit Green myself, yet I'm still reluctant to vote for them in the Bundestag. I don't trust they'll do a good job."" Bayaz is not discouraged. He recalls a recent meeting where an industry lobbyist stormed into his office to complain about several policy ideas. ""I told him, 'This has been the Green position for years, why make a big deal now?' And he said to me, 'Because now I have to take you seriously',"" Bayaz recalls. ""Sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's negative but they are taking us seriously.""

aa9300fade8df34af4a0,2021-09-14,Smaller acquisitions run at hottest pace since 2007 as riskier deals shunned,"Asset management Smaller deals between asset managers are running at the hottest pace in almost 15 years as businesses hunt for tactical acquisitions instead of bigger, riskier purchases many of which have failed in one of the world's most fragmented sectors. The first nine months of this year has seen more deals worth less than $1bn between asset managers than at any point since 2007, according to data from Refinitiv. Those deals, which are meant to boost operating performance rather than reshape companies, are also up 5 per cent over the same period last year. ""We expect the trend of tactical, smaller M&A transactions will continue as asset managers look for ways to enhance their growth prospects,"" said Michael Cyprys, analyst at Morgan Stanley. Cyprys added that instead of trying to absorb a big rival, asset managers will look to buy in new products and new ways of reaching clients. ""While scale continues to be an important element of success in this sector, ultimately it is about having the right solutions,"" said Janis Vitols, head of Asset Management Investment Banking at Bank of America. He added that several large asset managers had also been loath to buy in skills and departments they already possessed, risking culture clashes and creating problems that consume huge amounts of management time. Intense competition for new investors and a steady decline in fees has long driven bouts of deal activity across the sector. The asset management industry is dominated by a select group of titans, led by BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity. At the other end of the scale are smaller boutiques that prosper by targeting specific sectors. In the middle sit a swath of asset managers who have to decide whether to seek scale via a big transformative deal or expand into new areas with a more tactical approach. Asset managers have increasingly sought technology and new areas of growth to offset declining fees and cater to a retail investor boom. Hot areas include private markets for debt and real estate, and products that reference environmental, social and governance metrics. Among fintech-oriented deals in recent months, JPMorgan bought OpenInvest, which helps financial advisers build ESG portfolios, and Campbell Global, a forest management and timberland investment company. JPMorgan also bought Nutmeg, a UK digital adviser, in a deal that valued the platform at £700m."
f7f4294c24c50db34ea6,2021-09-13,'Do good' inflows boost ESG funds,"Investor activism Commercial success of ethical ETFs draws more scrutiny, says Chris Flood Index-tracking funds that employ environmental, social and governance metrics are attracting record-breaking inflows, as rising numbers of investors adopt strategies that go beyond achieving the best financial return. And this demand for ETFs that aim to align investment imperatives with ""do good"" objectives reflects a growing level of shareholder activism focused on objectives such as combating climate, tackling racism, encouraging gender diversity, and challenging excessive executive pay. Investors ploughed $97.4bn into ESG ETFs in the first seven months of 2021, as new business accelerated sharply from the record $89bn gathered over the whole of last year. This boosted global assets in ESG-focused ETFs to $309bn by the end of July, according to ETFGI, a London based consultancy. But such rapid growth has also created controversy over whether the growing number of products with ESG-themed mandates are achieving their advertised objectives. On recent evidence, many of the vehicles are demonstrating that ""doing the right thing"" does mean financial return objectives need be overlooked. Carolyn Weinberg, global head of product for the iShares ETF and index investments business at Black-Rock, says that the resilient performance of many ESG-themed ETFs during the market turmoil that accompanied the onset of coronavirus has increased investors' appetite for such products. A study published in January by the data provider Morningstar found that 25 out of 26 ESG equity index trackers beat funds that were conventionally weighted by market capitalisation, when it came to tracking the most common benchmarks last year. ""Some of the outperformance in 2020 was due to sector and factor exposures but it was also driven by single stock selection which showed that ESG scores do matter,"" says Weinberg. ""It made investors realise that the outperformance delivered by ESG is real. It has led to an increase in adoption everywhere."" Confidence is spreading among investors that companies scoring well on ESG criteria can also deliver better risk-adjusted returns. Coalition Greenwich, a US consul-tancy, interviewed 151 portfolio managers at pension funds, endowments and foundations in North America and Europe this year, and found that more than a quarter (27 per cent) of the respondents thought sustainable investments would outperform the relevant benchmarks. A fifth of the respondents said that positive benefits could be delivered by incorporating ESG into their portfolios, while 11 per cent said ESG would help to reduce risks. ""Institutions expect sustainable investments to generate attractive returns, either matching or outperforming benchmarks,"" notes Davis Walmsley, a managing director at Coalition Greenwich. ""[But] many also expect additional benefits, such as portfolio diversification or enhanced risk management.""    However, these rosy expectations are challenged by Bradford Cornell, an emeritus professor of finance at UCLA's Anderson School of Management. He believes that any outperformance delivered by companies highly rated on ESG criteria will prove temporary. ""Investors who favour using ESG criteria when choosing investments cannot expect to have their cake and eat it, too,"" Cornell argues. ""Tilting portfolios toward higher rated ESG securities is almost certain to reduce risk-adjusted returns over the long run."" Despite this scepticism, regulators particularly those in Europe are pressing pension funds and other institutional investors to integrate climate considerations into their decisions over asset allocation, which is fuelling demand for sustainable investment strategies, including the use of ESG ETFs. Nearly eight out of 10 of the institutional investors questioned by Coalition Greenwich expected to use sustainability criteria in their investment decisions by 2026. Similarly, a survey by BlackRock found that a group of 425 institutional investors, which together oversee $25tn, plan to double their allocations to sustainable strategies from 18 per cent of total assets to 37 per cent by 2025. Managers are rushing out new products to meet this interest. ""We have seen massive product proliferation since the first ESG ETF was launched in 2001,"" says Deborah Fuhr, managing partner and founder of ETFGI. ""The number of ESG ETFs launched has almost doubled to 644 [now] from 324 as recently as the end of 2019."" But ESG-focused ETFs come in a variety of shades of ""green"" ranging from ""light"" to ""dark"". ""Lighter green"" versions are generally designed to deviate only slightly from the returns delivered by a parent index weighted by market capitalisation, while they pursue investments that can promote ESG aims, such as reducing in carbon emissions. By contrast, ""Dark green"" funds, such as so-called ""Paris-aligned"" ETFs, will aim to achieve a much larger reduction in carbon emissions by investing only in the top-rated or best-in-class ESG companies. ""There is a wide divergence in the approaches offered by ESG ETFs which is not always fully appreciated by investors,"" says Walmsley. Paris-aligned ETFs have been designed to align with the goal of curbing the increase in global temperatures to 1.5C compared with preindustrial levels. Their holdings must have a carbon intensity grammes of carbon dioxide per dollar of revenue half the level of the parent index and they must also meet future decarbonisation targets. However, ETFs with mandates to make investments that align with the ambitions of the Paris climate accord generally have fewer constituents meaning a potentially wider range of return outcomes than their parent index. BlackRock's MSCI World Parisaligned ETF, known by its ticker as WPAB, has 684 constituents, compared with the 1,291 companies included in its conventional MSCI World ETF, known as URTH. Even so, Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable finance development at J Safra Sarasin, the Swiss private bank, says that the criteria used to choose constituents for some Paris-aligned ETFs are not sufficiently rigorous to ensure that global temperature increases would be limited to 1.5C. ""Our analysis suggests that just 176 companies from 6,000 listed globally have a business plan consistent with a 1.5C pathway,"" he says. Rapid product proliferation has also fuelled concerns among regulators about the problem of ""greenwashing"", whereby managers make unjustified claims about the environmental qualities of their funds. Germany's financial regulator BaFin launched a consultation in August with the aim of tightening the requirements that asset managers will need to meet when setting up funds labelled as ""sustainable"". Two whistleblowers that previously held senior ESG roles at asset management companies have also made stinging criticisms about socalled 'sustainable' ETFs. Desiree Fixler, the former ex-head of sustainability at DWS, the German asset manager, says that most ETFs are ""not impact orientated"" and ""do little to stop climate change or social injustice"". ""Asset managers need to show that the companies owned by ESG ETFs are actually changing the world for the better,"" says Fixler.    Tariq Fancy, who was global chief investment officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock for almost two years until 2019, likens ESG funds to ""selling wheatgrass to a cancer patient."" He has described the ""lofty and misleading marketing messages"" about ESG by asset managers as a ""deadly distraction"" from dealing with the risks of climate change. In response, BlackRock says that ESG ETF inflows can only help to drive the decarbonisation of the global economy. ""Every company is waking up to ESG,"" says Weinberg. ""Investor inflows into ESG funds are driving big changes and forcing more companies to think about their policies. These changes in corporate behaviour will increase over time."" ETFs marketed as ESGfriendly need to show demonstrable benefits"

bcb008a6e2afc49b8dde,2021-09-13,Demand for advice rises as not all investors go it alone,"Asset management Alongside a surge in retail share trading, traditional and 'robo' advice is being sought, reports Michael Mackenzie Growing demand for advisory servicesin the wake of the pandemic has ignited a race among asset managers to acquire customers needing help tonavigate volatile markets. New share trading account openings have surged overthe past year,against a backdrop of strong marketgains and central bank support stimulus measures that have kept interestrates low all of which haveincreased the risk tolerance of someretail investors. But the investmentclimate has also spurred demand forfinancial advice, via pure digital or""robo"" services, as well as morehybrid models that combine technology with a human touch. ""Times of uncertainty are usually atrigger for people seeking advice,""says Brian Concannon, head of DigitalAdvisor, which is Vanguard's onlineprofessional money manager service. ""A common reason for why peopleseek advice is that, over time, theirwealth increases and they recognise""there is a need to be more thoughtfulabout investing."" "" His analysis suggests that thiyear's surge in share trading accountopening will result in the more successful investors boosting demandfor advice in future. However, there isevidence that many investors seekprofessional help after making theirown first foray into markets for otherreasons, too. ""Risk does play a role here,"" says Awaad Aamir, wealth management analyst at Celent. ""A lot of self-directed investors start off with all guns blazing and, if they lose money, it motivates them to seek advice."" Recent trends towards commission-fee share trading services, easy ways of buying fractions of highly priced stocks, and a profusion of online financial literature also explain the surge in account opening. The number of new US investment accounts increased from 35m in 2016 to 63m by the end of last year, according to Celent. It forecasts that the figure will reach 75m by the end of 2021 and 115m by 2024. Brokerage Charles Schwab coined the term ""generation investor"" earlier this year to describe the surge in new retail investor accounts in 2020, despite a ""global pandemic, economic uncertainties and market volatility"". Schwab found that 15 per cent of all US equity investors started out in 2020, with a median age of 35. But Schwab's survey of these new investors noted that ""this group is not all short-term risk-takers,"" and ""they want to make informed decisions backed by education and professional guidance"". That is why the likes of Vanguard, Schwab and Fidelity are intent on providing hybrid advice that spans both digital and human platforms. Others, like JPMorgan, have bought advice platforms such as Nutmeg in the UK, while Vanguard has also launched an advisory service for UK investors. ""Accessibility, affordability and awareness are the three factors driving the demand for advisory services,"" explains Concannon. An upsurge in demand for professional help from this swelling tide of investors has broader implications for financial products, too.    Financial advisers have long steered clients towards exchange traded funds as they have lower costs and are more tax efficient for investors than mutual funds. This trend is expected to accelerate as ETFs become a more important element of model portfolios whereby advisers select a diversified mix of equities, bonds and other assets to meet a range of risk and return profiles. ""Advisors continue to be a strong user of ETFs and model portfolios are seeing increasing adoption,"" says Matthew Bartolini at State Street Global Advisors. ""Building wealth for a client's portfolio requires minimising fees and being tax-efficient in order to preserve wealth."" Assets held in the US model portfolio market are expected to more than double from $4tn overthe next five years to $10tn, according to Black-Rock. The asset manager forecasts half of the new investor inflows for its US ETF arm, iShares, will be directed by model portfolios, up from around a third in 2020. Martin Small, head of the USwealth advisory business at Black-Rock, says that delivering a servicefor ""the portfolio of the future"" means providing clients with accessto ETFs, mutual funds and separatelymanaged accounts (SMAs) that helpharvest tax losses from securities. According to Small, US householdsinvest some 70 per cent of their funds in managed products, led by ETFs,""low-cost mutual funds and SMAs. ""Inorder to really help the client, youneed to give them a range of products that can help them achieve their financial goals,"" he says. Another burgeoning trend is that of financial advisers being pushed by clients beyond traditional investment styles such as quality, momentum, value and growth. Nowadays, environmental, social and governance metrics are becoming increasingly important. New platforms that provide a customised approach also known as direct indexing are seeking to help financial advisers meet that demand. ""Advisers are looking for a way to differentiate themselves and connect with clients,"" observes Doug Scott, chief executive at Ethic Investing, a provider of direct indexing strategies for some 80 financial advisers across ESG with $1.2bn of assets under management. In the past, only the wealthiest of investors sought advice but, now, as the barriers fall, advisers are mindful that they need plenty of options to satisfy a broader audience in order to win and retain customers. 'If they [self-directed investors] lose money, it motivates them to seek advice'"
b1d5577e4cbe5f054022,2021-09-13,Holding business to account,"Human rights were once a fringe topic at business school but customer and investor pressure are pushing them up curricula When Michael Posner proposed creating a human rights centre at New York University, he firmly deflected suggestions that it should be based at the law school. Instead, in 2013, he established the Center for Business and Human Rights at Stern School of Business, where he is Jerome Kohlberg professor of ethics and finance. It was the first such entity at a business school. ""I said I want to go into the belly of the beast,"" recalls Posner, who had spent his career in the legal profession, advocacy and government, specialising in human rights. Just as he found governments had often shied away from holding business to account, ""the reaction of the more traditional mainstream finance professors was, what the hell does this have to do with business?"" Yet within a few weeks of him starting, the collapse of the eight-storey Rana Plaza garment plant in Bangladesh, which killed more than 1,100 workers, focused global attention on ""how companies should deal with factory safety in a very poor country with chronic, massive problems"", says Posner. Although environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues have risen to prominence in recent years, with a notable focus on the environment, he concedes that ""in the ESG discussion, it's really been about 'E' and 'G', and the 'S' has been left out"". Nevertheless, business and human rights as an area of research and teaching in business schools has expanded significantly, taking in topics as diverse as outsourcing, land rights and privacy. Academics cite a focus on migrant workers' conditions in the Gulf, cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the responsibilities of Facebook around disinformation in social media. In 2016, Alliance Manchester Business School in the UK created the Business and Human Rights Catalyst for research and policy development. The following year, Alliance, Stern and Geneva School of Economics and Management (GSEM) at the University of Geneva founded the Global Network of Business Schools for Human Rights. Some 50 business schools attended the network's annual meeting last November, where partners including the Global Business School Network launched a tool kit on human rights for business schools. Stern offers courses on the subject to undergraduates and MBA and executive MBA students. This autumn, GSEM is launching a pioneering master of science in responsible management, for which students will explore core topics such as responsible management and sustainable accounting and reporting, and then be offered electives including a specialisation in sustainable business and human rights. ""A lot of people say there is already a very congested curriculum in business and let's not embed more,"" says Dorothée Baumann-Pauly, who runs the GSEM programme. ""But these issues shouldn't just be add-ons. It needs to become the new way of teaching to create value for business and society. We don't just want to produce UN employees but those who will work in business and take on the human rights challenge."" Baumann-Pauly says that during the pandemic, she has sometimes given remote lectures on human rights on three continents in a single day. ""No longer is the question why do this, but instead how and how to implement,"" she says.    Her own research, originally at Stern, has focused on the cobalt supply chain, which has become ever more important as the material is in demand for electric car batteries. That has increased concerns in DR Congo about the use of child labour and working conditions. ""If we want to reach climate objectives, we also need to understand the human rights implications,"" says Baumann-Pauly. For Krist Dodbiba, who will be part of the first intake for the Geneva masters, his decision was inspired by a reflection during lockdown on his values and aspirations. After an undergraduate degree in business management with a specialism in hospitality, he wanted to study ""something that has a unique value, rather than 'Capitalism 101'"" before finding work back in his native Albania. ""My country has suffered from a lot of brain drain, with privileged kids who go to foreign schools, don't stay true to themselves and never go back,"" he says. ""I want to apply my skills at home."" The Geneva programme remains something of an experiment, with other specialist masters that cover topics such as sustainability remaining small scale and most business schools focusing instead on research or teaching individual courses in broader masters programmes. But as one human rights specialist who works for a ""big tech"" company says: ""It used to be an activity on the fringe for activist investors and non-governmental organisations buying shares to push proposals. Now, the institutional investors that matter, who manage trillions of dollars of capital around the world, are pushing the companies they invest in to change."" Posner says his Stern classes are oversubscribed, as students' career aspirations have shifted from finance and consulting to the tech sector and beyond. He argues that while the reaction of corporate executives to his work remains mixed, there are ""an awful lot who know these are the things that keep them up at night. If you are running a big technology, manufacturing or extractives business, one way or another you're bumping into these very tough issues. ""It's conceivable that you can be a business school in the 21st century and pretend these issues don't matter to business. I say to students, I'm teaching them for their seventh or eighth job. We're fighting an uphill battle, but I think it's the right battle."" 'No longer is the question ""why do this"", but instead how and how to implement'"
b215cfa162a7482f86a6,2021-09-11,'Why should profit outweigh humanity?',"Claer Barrett interviews comedian, TV presenter and consumer campaigner Joe Lycett for the new episode of her FT Money Clinic podcast When standup comic and presenter Joe Lycett stormed off the set of a daytime TV show recently, his social media followers thought he had lost his sense of humour. In fact, his apparent strop with presenter Steph McGovern was a publicity stunt designed to alert the public to the difficulties of recycling white PET plastics. The clips went viral, eventually shaming the manufacturer of Yop yoghurt drinks into switching to easier-to-recycle clear plastic packaging. ""As consumers, we absolutely should be mindful of our impact on the environment. But, really, the change has to come from those companies,"" Lycett tells the FT's Money Clinic podcast this week. ""I do slightly resent the onus being on the consumer to make the right choice, because often it's expensive to make the right choice, and not everyone has that option."" An unconventional consumer champion, 33-year-old Lycett has taken comedic campaigning to a professional level and turned it into a hit Channel 4 show called Joe Lycett's Got Your Back. One of his most famous stunts was changing his name by deed poll to Hugo Boss to protest against the German fashion house pursing small businesses with the word ""boss"" in their names. He also set up a fake Twitter account posing as Ross McEwan, then the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, to raise awareness of customers falling victim to ""numberspoofing"" scams who were denied compensation by their bank. Now in its third season, Lycett describes the programme as a ""camp, silly, daft entertainment show with a real grounding in solid journalism and consumer affairs"". As well as protesting about plastic, this series sees him expose lockdown-related issues including fraudulent puppy sales and the misery of unreliable broadband. Communications regulator Ofcom has responded by making him a ""broadband tsar"". ""It's an unpaid role, which I'm furious about,"" he says. On the podcast episode, presenter Claer Barrett quizzes Lycett about his upbringing in Birmingham and how this shaped his attitudes towards money, as well as his campaigning spirit. A pivotal moment was when his mother, who had worked for Cadbury for many years, was made redundant following the 2010 takeover by Kraft. ""The way that corporations treat people has a real indignity to it sometimes,"" he says. ""Obviously, companies exist solely for profit. That's what they do. And sometimes when they get massive, the kind of thirst for profit outweighs any kind of humanity, I suppose, and that, I think is wrong and makes me cross.""    Lycett says he has invested his ""telly money"" with the help of a financial adviser. He has focused on ESG investments, although he has some misgivings. ""All these ethical funds say that they're ethical, but I'm not checking I haven't got time to go through what they're all up to,"" he says. Nevertheless, he is encouraged that this style of investing is becoming more prevalent: ""That's the power of money, isn't it?"" He also bought into the GameStop phenomenon. ""My financial adviser said ""what are you doing?"" I'm sure [the shares] are worth dust now, but it was fun to be part of sticking it up to the man for a little while."" Other than buying his home in Birmingham, Lycett confesses that his thrifty and green tendencies mean he is not a big spender. ""I don't really buy things. I bought a Lexus, and I feel like a prick for that,"" he says, showing off his sunglasses which cost £7 from a charity shop in Bridgend. When he started out in comedy, he managed financially by juggling different jobs while living with his parents. ""I am wildly privileged ... I mean, mum and dad aren't rich, but I always knew that I could go home,"" he says. ""I had a little job in a theatre selling ice creams and then tiny gigs that would give me thirty quid here and there. I used to do graphic design as well, designing posters and logos, things like that. And so I was sort of making money from different places and scraping by."" One money rule that Lycett still sticks to was inspired by fellow comic Sarah Millican. ""A few people refer to it as Millican's Law,"" he says. ""If you've had a bad gig, spend the money on something you really want."" After a gruelling gig in Wigan a few years ago, Lycett bought a ""Blow your own trumpet"" necklace by the jewellery designer Bert Gilbert. He jokes that he could probably now afford to buy items featured on the pages of the FT's How to Spend It. ""Maybe I'll buy a yacht is that a good investment? How much is a yacht? OK, I'm not there yet."" Listen to the interview at FT.com/money-clinic or search for Money Clinic wherever you get your podcasts. 'Joe Lycett's Got Your Back' airs on Thursdays at 8pm on Channel 4."
7db258320b9db5d91583,2021-09-10,Human rights abuses persist as reforms stall,"Civil liberties Observers say thousands of Uzbeks are in prison under false charges. By Laurence Fletcher U zbekistan has been vocal in recent years about its efforts to reform after years of authoritarian rule. But reports persist of alleged human rights abuses. Under authoritarian dictator Islam Karimov, the Central Asian country was ranked alongside North Korea for its disregard of political rights and civil liberties. But, since Karimov's death in 2016, the country has made progress under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in trying to open up to the outside world. Mirziyoyev has embarked on reforms, including releasing more than 50 political prisoners. In addition, systematic child and forced labour in the cotton industry has ended, according to the International Labour Organization, and some political debate has been encouraged. Nevertheless, concerns have grown recently over the country's human rights and media freedoms, casting doubt over the direction of Mirziyoyev's reform programme. Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organisation, for instance, notes that ""thousands of people, mainly peaceful religious believers, remain in prison on false charges"". Reforms have ""definitely ground to a halt"", says Max Hess, Central Asian fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think-tank, and head of political risk at consultancy Hawthorn Advisors. ""The regime has continued to make some good noises publicly but it's not really been willing to challenge the power structures that often are responsible for human rights abuses."" Human rights campaign group Freedom House rates Uzbekistan in its 2020 report as ""not free"" and scores it 10 out of 100 for its global freedom status. ""Reports of torture and other illtreatment remain common"", it says. One such report of ill-treatment concerns former high-ranking diplomat Kadyr Yusupov, who was convicted of treason by a closed court last year. According to a 2020 submission to a UN working party by Yusupov's son Babur, who says his father was wrongly convicted, Yusupov was put into solitary confinement in a tiny cell infested with scorpions and snakes in April 2020 for 14 days. He was subjected to alleged psychological torture by Uzbek security services, including threats of sexual violence against him, his wife and daughter, it adds. In May this year, the UN working group on arbitrary detention found Yusupov's imprisonment contravened its Universal Declaration of Human Rights and called for his immediate release. But, in July, Uzbekistan's collegium of supreme court judges dismissed Yusupov's appeal, upholding last year's conviction. ""I think things are going backwards,"" says Babur Yusupov, talking about the government's reforms. ""The initial euphoria has gone."" The president's office and Uzbekistan's ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to a request for comment. Uzbekistan has been at pains to highlight its goals and the progress it has made. In February, it published its first ESG (environmental, social and governance) report, declaring that the country is ""changing massively"".    It highlighted its commitment to the UN's sustainable development goals, including to ""strengthen and guarantee human rights"". A government-backed website, Changeinuzbekistan.com, details how Mirziyoyev has addressed ""longstanding civil and human rights issues head on"". International observers acknowledge progress in some areas. Women's participation in parliament has increased. And the ILO has confirmed the end of systematic child and forced labour in the cotton industry, although it noted that some people have still been threatened with the loss of privileges or rights if they do not pick cotton. But observers still highlight curbs on free speech. According to Marc Behrendt, director for Europe and Eurasia programmes at Freedom House in Washington, while media freedom is ""demonstrably better"" than under Karimov, it has fallen backward during the pandemic due to government sensitivity over criticism of its handling of the crisis. His organisation scores Uzbekistan zero out of four for free and independent media. Human Rights Watch says journalists can face harassment and detention, and that bloggers critical of the authorities can face particular problems. Nafosat Olloshkurova, who writes under the name Shabnam Olloshkurova, organised demonstrations against corruption and unjust imprisonment. But, in 2019, she was arrested and sentenced to administrative detention, before being put into a psychiatric hospital, prompting calls from organisations such as Amnesty International for her release. She was released later that year. Olloshkurova told the FT that she was tortured during her detention and in hospital she was ""forced to take various pills and injections"", without being informed what they were. She left Uzbekistan last year and now lives in Ukraine but says she is ""still in a difficult situation"" because of her lack of rights in the country. Blogger Miraziz Bazarov, who has been critical of the president, this year suffered a violent attack by unknown assailants after publicly defending LGBT+ rights. After release from hospital, Bazarov whose case has been highlighted by Human Rights Watch was placed under house arrest following a search of his apartment, according to his lawyer, Sergey Mayorov. ""There is no freedom of speech in Uzbekistan,"" Mayorov told the FT. 'I think things are going backwards. The initial euphoria has gone'"
9fcb30c84ed243b12210,2021-09-09,Morningstar acquires specialist in race to provide direct indexing strategies,"Asset management Morningstar will become the latest big name to enter the field of ""direct indexing"", following in the footsteps of a handful of industry giants including BlackRock , Vanguard and Morgan Stanley . The Chicago-based group, with operations spanning credit ratings, investment research and asset management, is acquiring indexing specialist Moorgate Benchmarks, which develops the customised and personalised indices that lie at the heart of direct indexing. The concept allows investors to create bespoke portfolios tailored to meet their personal preferences for investment factors, such as tilts to value, quality or momentum investing or their own environmental, social and governance (ESG) parameters. In the US, direct indexing also allows investors to minimise their tax liabilities via tax-loss harvesting systematically selling losing stocks and replacing them with similar holdings in order to offset capital gains tax due elsewhere in their portfolio. Direct indexing strategies are cur- rently a niche service available only to wealthy investors, but Cerulli Associates forecasts that, in the US alone, they will account for $4.7tn of assets by 2030, 8 per cent of all adviser-managed assets, up from just $300bn in 2019. ""ESG and other drivers will lead to a future of mass or even hyper customisation,"" said Tobias Sproehnle, chief executive of Moorgate who will become head of Morningstar Indexes in Europe. ""Our kids will want more flexibility than we have. They will want to swipe left and right and decide exactly what is in their basket and what isn't."" Parametric, a division of investment group Eaton Vance and the global leader in direct indexing, was acquired by Morgan Stanley last year in a deal that kickstarted a flurry of activity. BlackRock bought Aperio, the industry number two, in November 2020; Vanguard bought Just Invest, a Californian wealth management boutique with a customisable, direct indexing service, in July; and JPMorgan Asset Management acquired OpenInvest, a fintech platform that facilitates the customisation of portfolios based on ESG metrics, in June. The acquisition of Moorgate Benchmarks, a 20-strong, three-year-old London and Frankfurt-based company, is also part of Morningstar 's drive to muscle in on the business of providing indices for exchange traded products and other investment funds. Morningstar is a minnow in indexing, accounting for just 0.6 per cent of the industry's $4.1bn of revenue last year, according to analysis by Burton-Taylor International Consulting. It is the 10th largest player in the sector, well behind the controlling oligopoly of MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell. But it has the highest five-year compound annual growth rate in the industry, of 43.5 per cent. More than $80bn of assets are now benchmarked against its indices by asset managers such as Lyxor, JPMorgan AM and BNY Mellon. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

c91d99b48aba135e85c0,2021-09-08,Green bonds: sustainable interest,"Twitter: @FTLex Green bond proponents once banged their heads against a wall. The rise of ESG investment means the bonds are suddenly in demand. Poland, France, Germany and the Netherlands have all sold sovereign green bonds. Yesterday Spain issued its own debut offering, borrowing €5bn over 20 years. The UK will launch a green gilt later this month. The torrent of climateconscious capital seems unstoppable. Green bonds earmark funds for projects that can mitigate climate change. In Europe, a green yield curve is developing, thanks to multiple maturities issued by benchmark sovereign Germany. European investors increasingly pay a ""greenium"" to own the bonds. Throwing money at the climate change problem has become fashionable, if still insufficient. The cost of halting global warming could be at least $48tn, Morgan Stanley says. That is more than half global GDP. This year's green bond issuance in all categories has topped $200bn. Still, green bond sales this year already exceed the total for 2020, says Bank of America. The issuance is still dwarfed by the broader bond market. Green bonds account for an increasing share. New sustainable bonds in June were just under a fifth of the total. Critics focus on the slipperiness of corporate positions. Whatever curbs green capital places on borrowers, nothing prevents them from using other funding sources for projects that do not meet green bond criteria. Simply rewarding some bonds or stocks with pricier valuations does not necessarily bring about positive action. But this ignores auditing efforts. Sustainable funds will be shamed if they stray. See the opprobrium of DWS after accusations of greenwashing, which the German fund manager denies. The EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation will turn the screws tighter on funds. The flush of green sovereign bonds represents a step in the right direction, not an end point. It should be applauded."
c56c5579ebc77832bdd0,2021-09-07,Stewardship failings raise asset management questions,"UK COMPANIES ""F unding the future is a privilege; we use it wisely and responsibly"" reads the report of one asset manager that didn't make the grade as one of the first signatories to the UK's new stewardship code. Another hopeful code-signer that cited the ""myriad nuances a responsible investor needs to embrace"" found nuance didn't earn them a place either. ""We know you are counting on us to do our part,"" said a third, who was also deemed to have fallen short in a review by the Financial Reporting Council of how investors hold companies to account. This was, in a sense, the main point of the exercise: a welcome attempt to separate the substance from the gloss that comes with stewardship or responsible investing. There were about 300 signatories to the old Code, dismissed by Sir John Kingman in 2018 as ""well intentioned"" but ""not effective"". That has been whittled down to 125, about two-thirds of those that applied, after the FRC assessment. The figures, at face value, serve to emphasise just how much flannel there is in the world of asset management, as the focus on ESG and responsible investing grows. When it came to asset owners and service providers, more than 80 per cent of applicants were approved as signatories. But in asset management, barely 60 per cent made the grade. In trying to penetrate the clouds of well-meaning and green guff, the FRC asked for evidence and examples to support the type of policy statements cited above to allow them to assess different business models, investment styles or policies. The result: too many can't demonstrate that they're doing what they say they're doing. That means the process wasn't always comparing like with like. Sure, it's embarrassing that a blue-chip like Schroders didn't make the grade while an index fund giant like Vanguard and smaller peers did, especially as active fund fees have defied gravity even as a deluge of overseas, tracker money has diminished their weight within the UK market. But Schroders' key sin seems to have been the format of its submission rather than the underlying content, according to people familiar with the details. The approaches being vetted could be quite different between institutions. Allowances were also made for the size of the applicant. More information about submissions could help and the FRC is considering a grading system (beyond pass/fail) for next year. More broadly, there is a danger that box-ticking and boilerplate moves from reports and policies to the letter-writing and meetings needed to show practical effect. ""Endless bureaucracy"", commented one fund manager (whose organisation did make the cut), noting the irony that this deluge of engagement will come just as companies themselves are compelled to publish more about their consideration of groups beyond their investors.    One possible disconnect is whether this flurry of activity translates into a willingness to stand up and be counted when serious issues arise: shareholders in Vectura have been remarkably quiet on whether a tobacco company is a good buyer for the inhaler group. Another is whether the investment operations and governance teams within big groups are really in harmony or not: on some occasions, as with governance concerns raised around the Bridgepoint listing, the stewardship function can seemingly be left playing catch-up after investment decisions are made. The backdrop here is concern that the UK market is sluggish, overly riskaverse and too focused on dividends to support companies in boosting valuations, given the steady stream of takeover bids for listed companies. The stewardship code covers the bogstandard business of strategy, risk and performance as well as the ESG issues that are ever more important in attracting clients' money. Showing how those work together well in the long term remains a question for the whole sector, admitted as code signatories or otherwise. helen.thomas@ft.com Too many can't demonstrate that they're doing what they say they're doing"
a2262491bb93bc343863,2021-09-06,More bosses must get aboard the bandwagon on ESG reporting,"Letters In their reporting on the scramble to join the environmental, social and governance bandwagon, Michael O'Dwyer and Andrew Edgecliffe- Johnson (Report, August 30) fail to mention the UK's Big Four accounting firms' contribution to the World Economic Forum's 2020 promotion of stakeholder capitalism and the need for consistency of sustainability reporting. This guidance sets out how ESG and the UN's sustainable development goals should be measured and reported. As an active nonagenarian and career-long auditor there is no doubt in my mind these metrics will always need to be assured independently for their accuracy, reliability and the trust we can place on them. Who better to do this than trained auditors internal and external with today and tomorrow's technology but, only if the quality of their work is also measured and assured. ESG is not a new requirement, nor is stakeholder capitalism. Peter Drucker and John Humble in the 1970s both proclaimed on the environmental and social responsibilities of management and companies. R Edward Freeman promoted his stakeholder theory in the 1980s. The Prince of Wales founded today's Business in the Community in the 1980s, and has been promoting environmental and social company responsibilities to this day. The Commonwealth too has embedded ESG in its governance practices and reporting, pioneering much of today's ESG debate and practices, supported at that time by my own institute. Sustainability has been on the UN's agenda from the beginning of this century. But who was listening then, and who is now? And how sure are we its targets will all be achieved? How future generations judge today's ESG reporting, measuring, assessment and independent assurance must be on the agenda of all boards of directors and their audit and risk committees. Evidence today shows the ESG bandwagon has too few travellers. This has to change, for the planet, for all people and for the prosperity of all nations.

f5a78ac224ea001bbd92,2021-09-06,Investors want COP26 to agree climate terminology,"Letters Clarity matters. A fund using the climate or environmental, social and governance moniker in its name should demonstrate its particular focus on those considerations in public disclosures to investors. There are a range of approaches to cutting carbon intensity and to improving ESG profiles. Efforts to bring transparency should illuminate differences in these approaches rather than conflate them. Unfortunately, the recent research by the group InfluenceMap (""Climatethemed funds often fall short of Paris goals, says think-tank report"", Report, August 27) does the latter, confusing the varied investment strategies that underlie many funds. Of the 130 funds the group's analysis labelled as ""climate-themed"", most don't stipulate alignment with global temperature targets for the stocks they select. The analysis includes only two of the roughly 15 exchange traded funds in the market that are benchmarked to indexes designed to align with such thresholds. (Both ETFs align positively, the analysis shows.) Yet it included 593 ESG funds without regard to whether those funds include climate considerations in their mandates. Most don't. To avoid apples-to-oranges comparisons, we call on policymakers at COP26 to advance a common language for climate-themed investments. We urgently need metrics built on standards that help investors make more informed decisions when choosing how to further global climate goals.

16e07ba5298b0f5e3903,2021-09-06,Equity should be offered to employees too,"I t was Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's partner in quotable business aphorisms, who once quipped: ""Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome."" So it is no surprise that, over the decades in which the consensus set in that a chief executive's main job was to create value for their shareholders, boards began adding ever more stock to CEOs' compensation packages. This, the refrain went, was the way to match up the interests of managers and owners. Yet a couple of strange things have happened in the two years since the US Business Roundtable made its symbolic break with shareholder primacy. First, the investors, with whose interests executives were supposedly so well aligned, have begun voting against CEOs' compensation packages in ever larger numbers. Second, heedless of Munger's mantra, executives' incentives have remained overwhelmingly focused on shareholder outcomes, even as they have professed what fine stakeholder capitalists they are. So the way companies now pay their top officers is failing to satisfy shareholders while undermining executives' credibility as guardians of other stakeholders' interests. This week, a study spanning seven European countries found an 18 per cent increase this year in shareholders dissenting over pay resolution. In the US, too, protests over executives' rewards have hit a record high, with once placid institutions baulking at the $230m GE gave CEO Larry Culp and the $155m Bobby Kotick took home for running Activision Blizzard. You don't have to be Bernie Sanders to wonder how much empathy a CEO earning nine digits has with employees and other stakeholders barely scratching a living. Yet it is still startling that three-quarters of investors now think that executive pay is simply too high, as a recent London Business School survey found. Only 18 per cent of investors bought the familiar argument that such high pay is needed to ""recruit and retain"" the best executives. But what about the nonshareholders? In a controversial analysis of Business Roundtable members' actions since signing 2019's stakeholder pledge, two Harvard Law School academics last month found that none had yet tied directors' compensation to stakeholders' interests. That seems unlikely: other studies suggest that more than one in five US companies now includes some environmental, social or governance metrics in their incentive plans, such as goals for increasing diversity or cutting carbon emissions. But those stakeholder metrics which boards have adopted typically focus on annual bonuses and put little of the CEO's total compensation at risk. Investors suspect that boards are simply adding complexity to already conveniently impenetrable packages. Meanwhile, as accounting standard setters have yet to agree common definitions for most ESG measures, there is equal concern that boards are picking pet metrics and setting targets that will be hard to miss, inflating packages further.    The conditions are ripe, then, for a rethink of compensation norms, but can incentives be redesigned to produce outcomes that satisfy both shareholders and other stakeholders? The answer lies in the economic logic that persuaded so many executives to espouse the stakeholder agenda in the first place: that, at least in the long term, doing the right thing by employees, customers and the environment builds value for shareholders. That is making investors increasingly keen to see more CEO packages take the form of simple grants of equity, held for at least five years, says Alex Edmans, one of the authors of the LBS study. Most environmental and social goals cannot be achieved in the time between annual bonus awards. Better, instead, to incorporate only the most relevant and clearly measured of them into longerrange stock awards, of which a significant portion will be at risk if the goals are missed. If more stock sounds a perverse prescription for a stakeholder-driven age, it need not be if boards take two further steps. First, directors need to ask whether they can justify the potential payouts to all of their stakeholders. It is becoming clearer that the worst excesses of C-suite pay are damaging relations with shareholders and trust in capitalism more broadly. Reining them in would not only head off clashes with investors or hostile politicians seeking to impose pay caps it might just rebuild some trust. Second, if boards truly believe that equity ownership is vital for focusing executives on shareholder value creation, then they should extend that logic to other employees. As one Harvard Business School study found, businesses with widespread employee ownership ""are more productive, grow faster, and are less likely to go out of business than their counterparts"". If anything would align the interests of investors and the staff who the majority of CEOs see as the most important of their stakeholders, it is making more employees shareholders. Given that many CEOs are already multimillionaires, boards might even reflect on what might happen if they took a chunk of the stock reserved for executives and distributed it around people for whom even a small stock payout would be a transformative incentive. andrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com If anything would align the interests of investors and staff, it is turning more workers into shareholders"
81144860d4f8b15c9fce,2021-09-04,Morningstar urges tougher ESG disclosure rules,"INVESTING Regulators consider action to standardise ESG information Securities data company Morningstar has urged regulators to accelerate the drive against greenwashing and ensure that ""the bars are not set low"" on disclosing environmental, social and governance (ESG) information to investors. ""It is terrific that regulators are looking at [ESG] because it is a sign that they consider it important and that they think it is meaningful in the way that investors make decisions,"" said Kunal Kapoor , Morningstar's chief executive, in an FT interview. ""It is inevitable that there will be regulations in this area. We do expect them. It is a positive because it is shining a light. It is moving the discussion forward."" The priority for global regulators in addressing ESG disclosures is that ""the bars are not set low"", Kapoor said. ""The wonderful thing that you see happening today in disclosure is that the bar keeps getting raised every year."" The Morningstar chief's comments come at a time when regulators in the US, UK and continental Europe, are considering reforming ESG disclosure rules so that investors have a better insight and can compare companies more effectively. Many investors, including retail savers, complain that the data now published is not standardised across companies, making it hard to judge performance. In July, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco) launched an inquiry into ESG ratings and data providers. In the US, companies, including ExxonMobil , have called on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate ESG raters. The SEC is expected to unveil proposed ESG disclosure rules later this year, prompting a conga line of companies and their lobbyists to plead with agency officials for leniency. Kapoor acknowledged that new ESG regulations will add costs for Morningstar and other companies. But those costs are likely to be outweighed by the opportunities ESG regulations offer. ""I think in the spirit of broadening the market and bringing more transparency and accountability and consistency it is probably OK."" Morningstar has called for tough ESG regulations. The company broke with many other public firms in calling for the SEC to require climate risks to be published in an annual regulatory filing rather than somewhere on a website. Regulators are scrutinising ESG because of the massive amount of cash moving into the sector. Global ESG equity funds received $22bn in net new inflows in June, up 67 per cent year-on-year, Bank of America said in a report last month. Three out of every ten dollars that went into a global equity fund in the first half of 2021 went into ESG ? triple the proportion from just three years earlier, the bank said. Kapoor stressed that government-mandated ESG disclosures must be a foundation ? a starting point ? for companies.

f4a485d38f037e96e843,2021-09-02,Ark Invest fund launch taps appetite for ESG,"Financials Cathie Wood, whose Ark Invest is the largest active exchange traded fund provider in the US, has filed to launch a passively managed Transparency ETF, a divergence from her trademark focus on innovation. The fund will follow an index that screens out companies with poor environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores, including alcohol, confectionery, fossil fuels and metals companies but also, unusually for an ESG-type fund, banking. The index will include companies with good scores for factors such as transparency, good documentation on their privacy, diversity, ethical and customer standards, those that are named in fewer lawsuits, and which appear higher on corporate trust rankings. ""Investors are increasingly focused on ESG attributes and such products ... have been in demand in 2021. This is a rare index-based approach from a firm well known for active management,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. He added that the index of about 100 companies holds many large-cap growth ones such as Apple, Nike, Nvidia and Salesforce but also includes Ark favourite Tesla, the electric car maker. ""While actively managed ETFs like those offered by Ark will often include some individual ESG metrics, this ETF will focus solely on them rather than earnings growth or valuation,"" he said. The index, which will rebalance quarterly, gives a 1.14 per cent weighting to Tesla, unlike Ark's flagship actively managed $22bn Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) that had allotted a weighting of 10.76 per cent to the company as of yesterday. The underlying index for the Transparency ETF is jointly provided by an independent company called Trans- parency along with well-known sustainability index provider Solactive. Ark Invest declined to comment and Solactive did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wood, who is chief executive of Ark Invest which manages about $45bn across six active and two passive ETFs, has been the subject of growing controversy this year after failing to deliver the stellar returns that made her a household name in the US in 2020.

The letters ""ESG"" appeared no less than 91 times in its initial public offering prospectus. The word ""sustainable"" featured even more prominently 107 times. Doing good makes for a good investment case these days. Fund managers are flocking to companies with strong environmental, social and governance credentials. Total assets in US ESG funds reached $304bn during the second quarter, nearly double the amount of the same period a year before, according to Morningstar. Allbirds, whose eco-friendly shoes range from $98 to $145 a pair, counts fund heavyweights T Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton among its backers. It was valued at about $1.7bn in a private funding round last September. But the ambitions of the San Francisco start-up to complete the first ever ""sustainable equity offering"" don't seem to come with a plan for sustainable profit. The company has been lossmaking since launching in 2016. Although sales rose 13 per cent to nearly $220m last year, net losses also ballooned from $14.5m in 2019 to $25.8m. Investors had better get used to it. Allbirds says it expects the losses to continue ""for the foreseeable future"". Allbirds is part of the boom in directto-consumer brands held up as models for running a retail business. These companies make and sell their own products, cutting out the middleman. But to lure customers, they need to spend heavily on marketing. At Allbirds, the bill was $55.2m last year. To justify a frothy valuation, Allbirds has to convince investors it can succeed in a market where there is already a lot of competition. Otherwise it risks suffering the fate of Casper Sleep. The direct-to-consumer mattress brand has largely traded below its IPO price since it went public last year."
baeb235cd73fc5dcabf7,2021-09-01,DWS/ESG: greenwashing,"Twitter: @FTLex With environmental, social and governance investment standards under the magnifying glass, investors are heating up. German and US regulators are probing asset manager DWS over claims it misrepresented its ESG analysis. Financial Times analysis suggests companies themselves could also be doing a better job of certifying their carbon emission offsets. The DWS investigation follows allegations from a former head of sustainability that ESG capabilities were embellished. This has raised valid questions on the odds of ESG living up to its aim of shifting capital towards companies trying to do the right things. Doing good is big business. Total assets in ESG funds have more than doubled to $2.2tn since the first quarter of 2020, according to Morningstar. ESG funds accounted for 40 per cent of DWS's €21bn of net inflows in the first half of this year. Higher fees for ESG products are an incentive to grow its potential universe. But ESG certification is subjective. Its reliance on adviser choice is cause for concern. The investment creates a ""dangerous placebo that harms the public interest"", thinks Tariq Fancy. He should know. Fancy used to run sustainable investing at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. His view that ESG certification is providing a smokescreen for harmful practices is one the industry must take seriously. ESG fund investment allocation is a further issue. DWS, which has denied wrongdoing and stands by its annual report disclosures, included payments group Wirecard in its own ESG funds long after allegations of fraud surfaced. Heavy weightings in tech stocks also feature in global ESG funds. Chipmaker Nvidia is one of the highest scoring groups. Yet it sells to energy intensive cryptocurrency miners. Indirect carbon emissions for tech companies are almost as high as for car or food groups, thinks Bank of America. The DWS probe should encourage asset managers to up their game. Doing good needs to be done right."
bfc287dffa0318d0c8d8,2021-08-31,Ice cream debacle exposes transatlantic investor split on Israel,"Political risk. Unilever backlash US states at odds with many Europeans over operations in occupied Palestinian zones Ben & Jerry's decision to pull out of occupied Palestinian territories spurred one Israeli cabinet minister to upload a TikTok video of herself binning its ice cream in protest. Now a series of US pension funds are looking at binning the entire company. The backlash highlights the divisions between US and European shareholders over Israel and Palestine. While US states want companies to continue operating in occupied Palestinian territories, European investors have been divesting over human rights concerns. ""It is almost an impossible choice for companies. Which side of the Atlantic do you want to upset?"" said Tara Van Ho, a lecturer at the school of law and human rights at Essex University. Companies, she said, would have to consider the relative costs of upsetting US or European shareholders. Some 35 US states have passed laws to combat the more-than-decade-old Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which lobbies for companies to stop operating in occupied territories. Florida's state pension fund, which has about £124m invested in Unilever, this month added the group to its blacklist of companies that boycott Israel. If Ben & Jerry's, which Unilever bought in 2000, does not cease its boycott within 90 days of being listed, the fund will not be allowed to invest in the company. The anti-BDS legislation has already been used to exact commitments from companies, including Airbnb. The holiday rentals group came under pressure from pension funds, including in Illinois and Florida, after saying it would remove listings for homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank in 2018, but later pledged that it would not boycott Israel. G4S, the security group, was forced to reassure US state pension funds that its decision to sell its Israel business in 2016 was made on ""strategy and commercial grounds"" rather than because of pressure from the BDS movement. BDS targets include banks that are accused of financing the settlements, security and telecoms companies whose technology could be used for surveillance, and companies involved in construction and demolition in the occupied areas. But in 2015, Scarlett Johansson, SodaStream's celebrity brand ambassador, was engulfed in a controversy over its factory in an illegal West Bank settlement. The Israeli home drinks machine maker closed the site soon after, though it denied that it was linked to the campaign. Some European investors have been calling for companies to restrict their operations in Israeli settlements, regarded as illegal by the United Nations and the EU, over concerns about human rights violations. The focus on rights comes as demand for sustainable investing has boomed.    Last month KLP, Norway's largest pension fund with $95bn in assets, said it had dumped 16 companies over an ""unacceptable risk contribution to human rights abuses"" in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Kiran Aziz, senior analyst for responsible investments at Unilever shareholder KLP, said responsible investors needed to ""take into account the inherent risk of operating in occupied territories and conflict zones"". She said: ""KLP made this decision publicly and we expect other investors to follow suit in Europe, the US and elsewhere as responsible investment is rapidly increasing."" Norway's oil fund recently excluded two Israeli companies, while New Zealand's Super Fund divested from five Israeli banks. Other investors have quietly reduced holdings in companies with links to the occupied territories. Last year the BDS movement said Dutch pension fund ABP divested from two Israeli banks partly over human rights concerns. ABP said it had sold out because ""our portfolio managers found other investment opportunities more interesting"". In May, pro-Palestinian groups hailed a victory as the Methodist Church in the UK dumped construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, which has come under scrutiny over the use of its bulldozers in occupied territories. It said the decision was down to Caterpillar's poor environmental, social and governance rating. Van Ho said companies and investors were coming under regulatory pressure in Europe to consider human rights, including business in disputed territories such as the West Bank and Crimea. France and Germany require companies to consider the human rights impacts of their or their suppliers' operations, while the EU has committed to introducing similar legislation. Richard Goldberg, who helped spearhead anti-BDS state law in 2015 as deputy chief of staff for legislative affairs in Illinois, said that while there were ""credible arguments"" for considering ESG in investment decisions, there was a ""malicious agenda"" when it came to Israel. ""It makes no sense to make a corporate decision to boycott Israel. It is morally wrong, politically wrong and economically wrong for your shareholders."" Unilever has sought to distance itself from the Ben & Jerry's decision and affirmed its commitment to Israel, including through a call with Israel's prime minister and letters to Jewish groups. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said the issue was testing the limits of ESG investing. ""It's important from a share price point of view, but also there is an ESG question in there: is it the first time we are going to have to think about how far ESG can go?"" Despite the pushback from US pension funds and fierce opposition from the Israeli government, other groups have backed Ben & Jerry's. Aziz said: ""If Unilever wants to maintain its position as a responsible business leader, it may want to consider more robust support of its subsidiary's decision."" Noam Perry at the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group that offers a tool highlighting alleged rights violations in investments, called on other companies to follow Ben & Jerry's example. ""We see these as shameful attempts by state legislators to punish companies that stand for universal human rights,"" he said. Van Ho said the ""swing of international legal regulations"" meant that more companies would have to consider pulling out of illegal settlements or risk penalties. ""If I were advising businesses on what to do, it would be to follow Ben & Jerry's lead,"" he said. Others insisted that businesses withdrawing was not the solution. Goldberg said: ""Does denying Jews and Arabs ice cream because of where they live help bring peace?"" £124m Florida pension fund's investment in Unilever $95bn Assets of KLP, which has ditched 16 groups over rights concerns 'It is almost an impossible choice.

89c7e9042bcd65f08735,2021-08-31,DWS probe casts shadow over sustainable investing,"Asset management. Greenwashing Fund houses fear mis-selling scandal as regulators turn their attention to ESG claims Asset managers fear that exaggerated claims over investments focused on sustainability could become a mis-selling scandal after regulators on both sides of the Atlantic sharpened their focus on environmental, social and governance investing at Germany's DWS. Investigations by regulators in Germany and US, triggered by allegations made by DWS's former global head of sustainability, have put greenwashing unjustified claims about environmental practices centre stage for Europe's investment industry. Rival fund houses fear they could also face scrutiny over claims of sustainability, which are hard to measure and vary between funds. ""The definition of what ESG or responsible investment truly is has been up for debate ever since it was created,"" said Sébastien Thévoux-Chabuel, a portfolio manager at Comgest. ""[What] has happened to DWS could happen to almost any investor."" Desiree Fixler, who was sacked earlier this year from her role as global head of sustainability at DWS, has alleged that the German asset manager made misleading statements in its 2020 annual report, where it claimed that more than half of its $900bn in assets were invested using ESG criteria. Last week, DWS defended how it represented its numbers, saying it was always clear that it differentiated between so-called ""ESG integrated"" assets, where sustainability issues were considered as part of the broader investment process for mainstream funds, and ESG assets, which are specialist products with a mandate to focus on sustainable investing. Both BaFin, the German financial regulator, and US officials, have opened investigations into the matter. Asset managers have showcased their sustainability credentials in recent years on the back of huge demand for ESG investments. Total assets in sustainable funds hit $2.24tn at the end of June, up from less than $1tn at the end of the first quarter of 2020, according to Morningstar, the data provider. But Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, the responsible investment charity, said asset managers' credibility on ESG investing ""needs to be tested to the nth degree"". She said: ""I don't think DWS is the worst out there by any means. If DWS has this problem, then a lot of other asset managers have this problem. I don't think they were an outlier or a total pariah there lots of others [asset managers] were doing something similar."" Claims over sustainability differ among asset managers and their customers. Some asset managers avoid stocks related to fossil fuels, for example, while others believe it is better to invest in oil-related stocks and use that as a way to pressure company boards.    Some fund managers buy bonds that inflict a penalty on borrowers if they fail to hit green targets; others see that as a reward for failure. Data providers that grade companies by sustainability metrics also generate different results. ""Data quality is really bad,"" said an industry executive familiar with DWS's work. ""It's like trying to invest with data from the 1980s."" A survey last year by BlackRock of 425 investors, representing $25tn in assets under management, found that poor quality or availability of ESG data and analytics represented the biggest obstacle to sustainable investing. Most big asset managers also claim to integrate ESG into all of their investments. Again this is poorly defined. At one asset manager, integration could mean portfolio managers have to consider a company's ESG score before buying a stock, while at another they might be excluded from buying certain shares. ""Integration differs by asset manager. The greenwashing comes in if they are doing something different to what they say they do,"" said one ESG specialist. ""My biggest fear is waking up in the morning to find out we have been accused of greenwashing. It is the next mis-selling scandal,"" he said, adding that the soaring popularity of sustainable investing meant ""something like this was always going to happen"". In July, the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, wrote to all asset managers to highlight concerns about applications to launch funds with an ESG or sustainability focus, warning that these ""often contain claims that do not bear scrutiny"". Other regulators are also increasing attention on ESG investing. European rules that came into force in March are designed to stop greenwashing. The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation imposed ESG reporting requirements on asset managers and other market participants. This all suggests that regulatory investigations into DWS are unlikely to be a one-off. ""It does seem as though there is a deal more positive talk about ESG and a little less delivery in practice by many fund managers,"" said one specialist working in the investment industry. 'If DWS has this problem, then a lot of other asset managers have this problem'"
f2884399993e6d294a28,2021-08-31,Investors in Xi's China face a rude awakening,"Xi Jinping, China's leader, has collided with economic reality. His crackdown on private enterprise has been a significant drag on the economy. The most vulnerable sector is real estate, particularly housing. China has enjoyed an extended property boom over the past two decades, but that is now coming to an end. Evergrande, the largest real estate company, is over-indebted and in danger of default. This could cause a crash. The underlying cause is that China's birth rate is much lower than the statistics indicate. The officially reported figure overstates the population by a significant amount. Xi inherited these demographics, but his attempts to change them have made matters worse. One of the reasons why middle-class families are unwilling to have more than one child is that they want to make sure that their children will have a bright future. As a result, a large tutoring industry has grown up, dominated by Chinese companies backed by US investors. Such for-profit tutoring companies were recently banned from China and this became an important element in the sell-off in New York-listed Chinese companies and shell companies. The crackdown by the Chinese government is real. Unnoticed by the financial markets, the Chinese government quietly took a stake and a board seat in TikTok owner ByteDance in April. The move gives Beijing one seat on a threeperson board of directors and first-hand access to the inner workings of a company that has one of the world's largest troves of personal data. The market is more aware that the Chinese government is taking influential stakes in Alibaba and its subsidiaries. Xi does not understand how markets operate. As a consequence, the sell-off was allowed to go too far. It began to hurt China's objectives in the world. Recognising this, Chinese financial authorities have gone out of their way to reassure foreign investors and markets have responded with a powerful rally. But that is a deception. Xi regards all Chinese companies as instruments of a oneparty state. Investors buying into the rally are facing a rude awakening. That includes not only those investors who are conscious of what they are doing, but also a much larger number of people who have exposure via pension funds and other retirement savings. Pension fund managers allocate their assets in ways that are closely aligned with the benchmarks against which their performance is measured. Almost all of them claim that they factor environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards into their investment decisions. The MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) is the benchmark most widely followed by global equity asset allocators. An estimated $5tn is passively managed, which means that it replicates the index. A multiple of this amount is actively managed, but it also closely tracks the MSCI index. In MSCI's ACWI ESG Leaders Index, Alibaba and Tencent are two of the top 10 constituents. In BlackRock's ESG Aware emerging market exchangetraded fund, Chinese companies represent a third of total investments. These indices have effectively forced hundreds of billions of dollars belonging to US investors into Chinese companies whose corporate governance does not meet the required standard power and accountability is now exercised by one man who is not accountable to any international authority. The US Congress should pass a bipartisan bill explicitly requiring that asset managers invest only in companies where actual governance structures are both transparent and aligned with stakeholders. This rule should obviously apply to the performance benchmarks selected by pensions and other retirement portfolios.    If Congress were to enact these measures, it would give the Securities and Exchange Commission the tools it needs to protect American investors, including those who are unaware of owning Chinese stocks and Chinese shell companies. That would also serve the interests of the US and the wider international community of democracies. SEC chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly warned the public of the risks they take by investing in China. But foreign investors who choose to invest in China find it remarkably difficult to recognise these risks. They have seen China confront many difficulties and always come through with flying colours. But Xi's China is not the China they know. He is putting in place an updated version of Mao Zedong's party. No investor has any experience of that China because there were no stock markets in Mao's time. Hence the rude awakening that awaits them.

16c5f9f58f5b60c97469,2021-08-31,Lessons for banks from the OnlyFans affair,"Working with the porn industry can pose legal and reputational risks If a bank has to pay attention to its social responsibilities beyond making a profit, there is no guarantee that it will share your view of what those responsibilities are. Many liberal activists have welcomed banks' increasing rhetorical embrace of the environmental, social and governance agenda. But an aggressive stance towards pornographers and sex workers has triggered concerns over banks and payment companies adopting the role of censorious moral guardians. OnlyFans, a company that promises to connect content creators whether producing pornography or not with an audience, blamed the financial sector last week when it announced it would close accounts that produced sexually explicit imagery. The sex workers on its site account for the vast majority of its traffic and have helped the UK-based start-up to reach a multibillion-pound valuation, but founder Tim Stokely said the company was struggling to find banks willing to deal with it. The company later reversed the decision to remove pornography, after a backlash. The argument for banks to stay away from porn is, if anything, stronger than staying away from coal. Beyond the debate over the social harms from constant, easy, and cheap, access to such images, many purveyors have inadequate moderation that has allowed illegal content including underage performers and revenge porn, posted without the consent of all participants to proliferate. Banks dealing in illegally-earned money risk enabling money laundering and could face their own visit from the authorities. Visa and Mastercard stopped serving PornHub, one of the main platforms, after a New York Times investigation showed the scale of revenge porn on the site. Similarly, in another industry where choices have to be made, many banks do not do business with the nascent legal cannabis business in some US states the drug remains illegal at the federal level. Complying with the law is essential, whatever the merits of corporate social responsibility. A BBC investigation into OnlyFans suggested that its approach to illegal content is lax, giving accounts that post content against its guidelines multiple opportunities to comply and being especially lenient with the most popular accounts. Nevertheless, if companies do manage to have strict moderation policies limiting their content solely to the legal behaviour of consenting adults the arguments would be more fine-grained. OnlyFans, which verifies users and viewers, has claimed that banks will not work with it because of ""reputational concerns"". So long as they obey the law, banks can refuse to deal with certain industries. There is a business imperative to anticipate pressure from other consumers. This is not limited to environmentally damaging projects, but to any that could lead to disparaging headlines, such as JPMorgan Chase's backing of a proposed football European Super League. That some groups in the US are putting pressure on payment companies aware the policy decisions of Mastercard and Visa can extend further than the reach of US law should be no surprise when environmentalists already adopt similar tactics. The market allows for businesses to do what they think is in their best interests, including setting their own tolerance for compliance risks in dealing with porn sites with less than perfect moderation or reputational risks. Just as some institutions are all too eager to ignore ESG concerns and focus on whatever is profitable so, too, will many banks find the multibillion-dollar porn industry too lucrative to ignore, whatever the wider impact."

b3df85f1a051665e3051,2021-08-30,Big Four scramble to join the ESG bandwagon,"Accounting firms fend off suggestions that investment is marketing hype but scale of shift in operations remains unclear The sustainability boom has moved trillions of dollars into environmental, social and governance funds and brought a new stakeholder-led agenda to corporate boardrooms. Now the Big Four accounting firms are jumping on a bandwagon that offers two tempting opportunities: an expansion of what companies must account for, and a chance to rebrand a scandalplagued profession as experts on climate change, diversity and winning consumers' trust. PwC put the booming demand for ESG advice at the heart of a $12bn investment plan it announced in June that will involve adding 100,000 employees and launching ""trust institutes"" to train clients in ethics. Bob Moritz, its global chair, said the investment would redefine and rebrand the firm ""to make sure we're valuable for what our clients need and what the world needs"". Deloitte, in turn, announced a ""climate learning programme"" this month for its 330,000 employees. KPMG's ESG work has included helping Ikea to analyse social and environmental risks linked to the Swedish furniture retailer's raw materials, and advising on the first green bond issued in India. The firms, along with EY, have been at the table as business groups try to thrash out new international standards for measuring sustainability. But as their new ESG focus looms larger in their marketing, some partners question the extent to which it will transform their businesses and warn that it may expose the firms to a backlash if they fail to live up to the standards they promote. The Big Four are responding in part to a rise in clients' budgets for developing net zero emissions plans and other sustainability initiatives. Tracking nonfinancial metrics, such as companies' carbon footprints, rather than simply their financial results, gives them a chance to generate more fee income and improve profit margins. The introduction of standardised ESG reporting metrics for companies would also create more work for accountants. This will potentially be facilitated by the proposed International Sustainability Standards Board, a new body that could be created by November to mirror the role the International Accounting Standards Board plays in setting financial reporting standards. Beyond accounting, the ESG trend also offers the Big Four other opportunities. They will have more scope to crosssell expertise, such as adding climaterelated criteria to the design of executive pay packages, a partner at another Big Four firm said. The number of global companies that include environmental or social metrics when deciding executive pay has already doubled since 2018, according to the latest annual report from ISS ESG.    The aim of PwC's ""New Equation"", which includes a rebranding based on ""trust"", was to seize on an ""inflection point"" as companies consider how to explain their impact on society after the pandemic, said a person briefed on the plans. Instead of simply ""answering the question we are asked"", it wants to ""frame"" clients' questions and enlist PwC teams with expertise relevant to other stakeholders such as employees, the person added. Consultants advising companies that are purchasing new technology, for example, could help support workers who risk losing their jobs as a result, he said. That consultants and accountants see ESG as a commercial opportunity is clear. Less clear is whether the scale of the changes in their organisations will match the marketing hype. At times, the firms struggle to articulate what their focus on broad concepts such as ""trust"" and ""sustainability"" means in practice. Punit Renjen, Deloitte's global chief executive, last week tweeted an article by some of the firm's senior thinkers about ""the link between trust and economic prosperity"". ""Trust is all-encompassing,"" the piece declared. ""Physical. Emotional. Digital. Financial. Ethical. A nice-to-have is now a must-have; a principle is now a catalyst; a value is now invaluable."" The ""climate learning programme"" is Deloitte's latest climate-related initiative. For all the promotion, it amounts to a 35-45 minute online presentation, a handful of interactive elements and an invitation to staff to reduce their personal climate impact. While the Big Four emphasise climate change and equality in their marketing and recruitment material, much of their investment is in unrelated areas. PwC's strategy announcement focused heavily on ""trust"" and ""sustainability"" but much of the $12bn it plans to invest will go towards two other key growth prospects: technology and Asia. The bulk of its 100,000 net new jobs are expected to be in technology, capitalising on demand from companies for help with cyber security, cloud platforms and data science. Only some will relate to ESG; PwC has not given a number. A quarter of the new investment will go towards doubling PwC's business in Asia, where the consulting market alone has grown by a third since 2015 to $32.9bn, according to Source Global Research, but accounts for less than 15 per cent of PwC's revenues. However, despite the buzz around cli- mate and social impact, consulting firms' continued interest in other growth opportunities suggests they recognise ESG advice will not displace, or even reshape, all their existing operations. They are also pushing deeper into sustainability consulting, despite critics claiming that the outperformance of ESG-themed strategies is illusory or will be shortlived. Two Harvard professors concluded this month that the US Business Roundtable's 2019 statement heralding a new era of stakeholder capitalism was ""mostly for show"". The roundtable's members include the heads of the Big Four and competing consultancies Accenture, Bain & Company, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey. Even if they are hedging their bets by investing in technology or regional shifts, jumping so publicly on the ESG bandwagon and holding themselves up as beacons of trust also carries risk for consultants. ""I think they will become a target for activists,"" said the UK managing partner at another accounting firm of PwC's plans, arguing that by promoting its ESG credentials the firm would attract scrutiny of its own record. ""It doesn't take much ... for someone to find PwC in country X is not quite complying with its own carbon emissions [standards] or is servicing clients that have an awful profile or history of modern slavery."" Asked whether PwC's focus on trust was a hostage to fortune given the scandals that have plagued its industry, Tim Ryan, chair and senior partner of PwC in the US, said: ""There's always a risk in leading. We're not perfect but we're massively investing to make sure everything we do is to do with improvement."" Tracking non-financial metrics, such as carbon footprints, offers a chance to improve profit margins Some partners question the extent to which it may expose firms if they fail to live up to the standards"
12c7365388127330e41f,2021-08-30,Corporate bonus culture impedes the push for net zero,"Governments across the world are urging big investors to galvanise the global corporate sector into meeting climate change goals. A growing number of asset owners and managers have taken their cue and are committing to secure an overall balance between greenhouse gas emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere net zero. Yet in the run-up to November's COP26 Glasgow summit to accelerate action on the 2015 Paris agreement's sustainability goals, it is striking how little has so far been achieved. A survey by Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK non-profit outfit, and Oxford Net Zero, an Oxford university research initiative, has found that only about a fifth of publicly traded companies in the Forbes Global 2000 list have made any form of commitment to net zero. At the same time, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, a body backed by the world's leading central banks, has noted that while companies are producing more information on climate change, disclosure of the potential financial impact on businesses and strategies the litmus test of corporate commitment remains low. The question is why. There are good grounds for questioning the depth of the investment community's commitment to sustainability. For many fund managers, trumpeting a commitment to climate change is just marketing greenwashing, in a word to address retail investors' increasing interest in sustainable investing. Monitoring and engaging with companies the so-called stewardship agenda is difficult and expensive. This results in a conspicuous dichotomy between the biggest fund managers' rhetoric and their voting records on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Note, too, the limits on institutional investors' voting power imposed by the structure of global markets. Public equity is a shrinking portion of total securities market capitalisation, while green bonds account for less than $1tn of the $100tn-plus global bond market, according to a 2020 report by multinational bank BBVA. Bond investors' leverage over borrowers is anyway negligible once the money is invested. The natural stewards on ESG are longterm asset owners such as pension funds. Yet they are increasingly detached from equity markets, as the UK example shows. According to the Office for National Statistics, private sector pension funds, which account for 83 per cent of all UK pension scheme assets, held a mere 10 per cent of portfo- lio assets in equities at the end of 2020. Most is invested in debt and unquoted assets such as property, private equity and infrastructure funds. This is not to downplay the successes of shareholder activists who have won notable battles against ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell on tackling the transition to low carbon. But in seeking to align corporate purpose with sustainability criteria they face big hurdles. With the average chief executive's tenure in the US Russell 3000 index less than seven years, and in the FTSE 100 five years and six months, boardroom time horizons are hopelessly misaligned with the 2050 timetable for the Paris agreement's carbon neutrality goals.    An overwhelming obstacle lies in the corporate bonus culture. Performancerelated pay relies on such yardsticks as share price movements and earnings per share. The enormous allocation of capital required to put the world's energy-related capital stock on the path to net-zero emissions will depress earnings, as will depreciation from the rundown of fossil fuel-intensive assets. And potentially, depress share prices. One remedy would be to attach ESG criteria to incentive structures. This already happens with annual bonuses. But consultants Willis Towers Watson estimate that only 4 per cent of S&P 500 companies include ESG metrics in the long-term incentive plans that are more relevant to the time horizon for decarbonisation. A higher percentage might simply encourage executives to unload high carbon assets on to less sustainably minded private equity managers. To address this problem, governments need to accelerate the obsolescence of the existing toxic energyrelated capital stock coveted by private equity through tougher tax and regulation on emissions. Yet the uncomfortable reality is that the bonus culture militates in favour of share buybacks that boost corporate earnings and against the huge reallocation of capital into renewables required to reach net zero. Putting these distorted private sector incentives high on the COP26 agenda should be an urgent priority. john.plender@ft.com The structure militates in favour of share buybacks and against the reallocation of capital into renewables"

48bd5c501554fbd8a690,2021-08-27,"Climate-themed funds often fall short of Paris goals, says think-tank report","Asset management Funds marketed as ""climate themed"" often hold shares in major polluters including big oil companies, and many are inconsistent with the goals of the Paris agreement, despite claiming to be ""aligned"" with it, according to analysis by think-tank InfluenceMap. Some 72 of 130 climate-focused funds examined, which collectively hold more than $67bn in assets and are managed by major investment houses including BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, were found to be misaligned with the Paris agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2C. Collectively, the 130 funds hold $153m in fossil fuel production chain companies, according to the report published today. Both a State Street ""fossil fuel reserves free"" fund and a BlackRock ""fossil fuel screened"" fund hold shares in Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66. Funds that more closely track broad stock market benchmarks would typically hold greater shares of their portfolios in such companies. ""It's very hard for investors to be able to accurately ascertain whether funds that are branded [as climate-focused] are actually Paris aligned or not,"" said InfluenceMap analyst Daan Van Acker. He noted the wide spectrum of terms used to describe green funds and the ""lack of transparency"" about what such marketing meant. Financial products labelled as responsible, sustainable and green have soared in popularity in recent years, and asset managers have come under pressure to align their portfolios with the transition to net zero emissions. But these products have often been criticised for having links to polluting companies or those accused of being socially or environmentally irresponsible. Ben Caldecott, from the University of Oxford Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, said retail investors would be surprised to see carbon-intensive companies in funds marketed as green. But he added that a fund's ecocredentials should be evaluated on more than the number of brown stocks in its portfolio. Asset owners could push polluters to become greener through engagement, which might have a greater impact on driving the transition to a lower carbon economy than simply investing in green stocks, he argued. Leaving such assets to investors disinterested in environmental goals is counter-productive, assets managers in this space say. Today's report measured how Parisaligned a fund was by assessing the forward-looking production of portfolio companies, such as how many internal combustion engine vehicles a car company planned to make. The researchers then compared that information to sector-specific frameworks for limiting warming to below 2C, taking into account each company's market share. A negative score indicated a portfolio owned too much brown or too little green. Seven climate-focused funds offered by State Street were on average minus 14 per cent misaligned, InfluenceMap found. Eight UBS funds were minus 8 per cent misaligned and eight Black- Rock products were minus 6 per cent misaligned. State Street said to meet ""differing investor needs"" it offered ""a range of ESG strategies, including funds aligned to the Paris Agreement, and funds that meet climate objectives in other ways"".    BlackRock said the research did not include several of its green funds, including some designed to be Parisaligned. It added that it offered clients ""a broad spectrum of sustainable strategies to support them in achieving their investing goals"". InfluenceMap said it assessed only funds for which it could obtain full portfolio holdings data. UBS said the study did not capture ""the positive impact of index based and tilting strategies"" which resulted in funds with ""a significantly lower carbon intensity and reduction of carbon risk but which deliver benchmark returns in line with the parent index."" About a third of the 130 funds scored in the minus 10 per cent to minus 20 per cent range, the report said. Such funds typically those that passively track market indices but apply a screening, such as excluding fossil fuel companies ""appear to provide limited climate benefit from a portfolio standpoint compared with the broader market"", it said. Even funds marketed as ""fossil fuel restricted"" often retained holdings in oil and gas value chain companies, such as refiners and distributors. Some passive funds did not exclude polluting sectors but underweighted them relative to the index. Among the most common fossil-related holdings in the funds analysed were oil companies Total, Chevron and ExxonMobil, and oil services company Halliburton, the report said. ""When you're talking about trillions of dollars [flowing into sustainable investing products] there's no way that scale of money can be massively better on ESG performance than the broad market,"" said Sonja Gibbs, head of sustainable finance at the Institute of International Finance. The report's assessment of another 593 broad ESG funds found 71 per cent were misaligned with Paris, with scores as bad as minus 100 per cent. Several had miners Rio Tinto and BHP in their top 10 holdings, while a Franklin Templeton ""sustainable equity fund"" holds oil company Woodside Petroleum."
76b5092413064b8ebb9e,2021-08-27,DWS falls after BaFin acts on allegations of greenwashing,"? Asset manager's ESG criteria queried ? Fired employee says it misled clients Shares in DWS, the German asset manager, fell more than 13 per cent yesterday following reports US and German authorities are investigating the €859bn group on claims that it misled clients about its sustainable investing efforts. BaFin, the German regulator, launched an inquiry after DWS's former sustainability chief alleged it was misrepresenting how it used environmental, social and governance metrics to analyse companies across its investment platform, said a person familiar with the matter. BaFin said it would not comment on individual companies but that it did routinely investigate allegations of breaches in ESG requirements by funds in its jurisdiction. The BaFin investigation was first reported by Bloomberg. US officials were investigating the same claims, said a person familiar with the matter. The US investigation was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice have been asked for comment. Desiree Fixler, fired this year as global head of sustainability, alleged earlier in the WSJ that misleading statements made in DWS's 2020 annual report, published in March, claimed that more than half of its $900bn assets were invested using ESG criteria. Fixler, a US citizen whose dismissal is being investigated in Germany, alerted the DWS management board to her concerns in November 2020, said one person briefed on the matter. Fixler said an internal assessment she had overseen had found the ESG risk-management system used by DWS was flawed because it relied on outdated technology and used ESG assessments provided by a range of external rating suppliers. But DWS portfolio managers were not required to consider the assessment when making investment decisions, the person said. That led to the inclusion of Wirecard, the payments company that crashed into insolvency this year, in a dedicated ESG fund run by DWS. DWS declined to comment ""on questions related to litigation or regulatory matters"". It did not respond to requests for comment on Fixler's allegations. In marketing materials, DWS claims a tradition of sustainable and responsible investing going back more than 20 years. Asoka Wöhrmann, chief executive since 2018, has said ESG is a cornerstone of DWS's corporate strategy. If DWS was found to have overstated its ESG credentials, ""possible outcomes"" include a fine and a requirement to relabel funds or compensate clients, Mandeep Jagpal, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, wrote. ""Even if the rumoured investigation was unable to verify that ESG claims had been overstated, the reputational damage to DWS could potentially hamper net flows,"" he said. Asset managers have rushed to proclaim their sustainability credentials on the back of soaring demand for ESG investments. Assets in funds deemed sustainable hit $2.24tn in June, from less than $1tn at the end of March 2020, according to data provider Morningstar.    The investigation is a blow to Deutsche Bank, DWS's majority shareholder, which made the asset manager central to its revival strategy.

f743ba4ba9f0550ff072,2021-08-26,OnlyFans: sin win,"Twitter: @FTLex It is surprising what you can justify with reference to inclusion and diversity. Porn, for example. OnlyFans has reversed plans for a ban on sexually explicit content. The platform distributes this on commission, alongside innocuous material. An alleged boycott by payment processors such as Bank of New York Mellon has evidently been circumvented. This is more obviously a victory for the business model of the UK-based group than the ""inclusion"" and ""diverse community"" hailed in a triumphant tweet. Porn businesses are typically excluded from ethical portfolios. Finding companies to exclude can be tricky. A typical screening removes zero companies from the MSCI World style index, according to a 2017 report by Schroders. Expanding the screening tends to capture industries only tangentially linked to porn. But this is not the first time payment processors have stopped working with sites involved in adult entertainment. In 2019, PayPal cut services to Pornhub. Visa and Mastercard followed suit. Platforms including Stripe and Square already ban payments connected to adult entertainment. Worries about illegal and exploitative content are valid. But the same fears have not prompted boycotts against larger, more mainstream platforms. Pornography remains popular on the internet. Data from Similarweb, a data business, show that adult websites such as XVideos and Pornhub receive more monthly visitors than Netflix. OnlyFans is one of the few sites to have become a household name. Creators say it has put more power into their hands. Founded in 2016, its popularity ballooned in the pandemic. Pre-coronavirus it had 20m users. Founder Tim Stokely now says the site reaches 130m. In recent years, OnlyFans has attempted to broaden its appeal. Its creators include singer Cardi B and reality TV star Sonja Morgan. Without porn, OnlyFans would no longer stand out and its business model would unravel. It takes a 20 per cent cut from payments made by fans. Instagram and Twitter exact no such commissions from tips sent to creators on their sites. Creators of mainstream content would quit OnlyFans once the audience lured there by adult content dispersed. The business needs porn more than it needs banks with strict ESG compliance."
ebdc379416c77509c0dd,2021-08-25,"Borrowed time BHP's oil and gas exit poses danger to credit rating, warns S&P Global","S&P Global has warned BHP that the miner's decision to sell its oil and gas business could threaten its credit rating, since it will leave the group even more reliant on iron ore. The rating agency said it could lower its rating on BHP by up to two notches in the coming months as the loss of the petroleum unit would result in a ""less diversified portfolio"". The warning follows BHP's announcement last week that it would sell the business to Australia's Woodside Petroleum in exchange for shares that will be distributed to investors. BHP, which also unveiled plans to shift its primary stock market listing to Australia, said it would put the miner in a better position to focus on commodities that would benefit from a global transition away from fossil fuels towards clean energy. But S&P said BHP's expansion into potash, a fertiliser, as well as increased focus on nickel and copper were ""likely to have a modest impact in the short to medium term"", adding that the group's portfolio may become ""slightly less diversified"" than some of its peers such as Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American. The rating agency said it had put BHP's investment grade A and A-1 short-term rating ""on CreditWatch with negative implications"". S&P's view contrasts with that of rival Moody's, which said last week that the sale of the oil and gas assets would be ""credit positive"" for BHP from an environmental, social and governance (ESG) perspective. The deal marked ""further material progress in BHP's push to lower carbon emissions and increases the portfolio mix towards commodities that will likely benefit from the global push to decarbonise,"" Moody's said. BHP has been steadily selling its unwanted assets over the past few years, disposing of its lossmaking US shale oil business in 2018 to BP and demerging its aluminium, manganese and other assets into a new company, called South32, in 2014. The oil and gas business contributed about 6 per cent to BHP's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation at $2.2bn in the 12 months to June. Iron ore generated $26.3bn of BHP's earnings, while copper accounted for $8.5bn and nickel $300m, S&P said. ""We previously saw BHP's diversification into the oil and gas sector as positively differentiating BHP from some of its peers, given our view that the petroleum assets are very competitive,"" S&P said. The merger of BHP's oil and gas business with Woodside Petroleum is expected to be completed by the second quarter."
41bb9339920a3bcb18fd,2021-08-24,China crackdown delivers windfall to bitcoin miners,"Crypto. Lost capacity Producing digital coins has become more profitable as competitors are forced to exit International bitcoin miners are reaping a windfall after China effectively banned the energy-intensive practice, juicing up the profits available to companies that use computer power to create new digital tokens. China's largest bitcoin producing provinces launched a clampdown on bitcoin mining in June, part of a broader attempt to cut down on carbon emissions and a push against private cryptocurrencies as the country works on its own officially-backed digital coin. China had been the biggest producer of bitcoins, accounting for half of output. Miners elsewhere say cooling production there has opened up the market to other competitors. ""Think of average daily global bitcoin production as the pie,"" said Shane Downey, chief financial officer of Hut 8 Mining, a Toronto-based listed group. ""The size of the pie stayed the same and each existing miner was able to help themselves to a much bigger piece."" Bitcoin miners create new coins by using powerful computers to solve mathematical puzzles. The number of coins that can be produced each day is fixed so, with fewer rivals, it is easier and cheaper to make new coins. The improving economics has meant that entrepreneurs are launching mining operations in countries around the world. The overall computer power dedicated to bitcoin mining globally initially halved in the aftermath of China's move but it now stands about 30 per cent lower than in May, according to data website Blockchain.com. The profitability of bitcoin miners depends on the market price of the coins, the cost and amount of electricity required to run the servers and the rate at which new units can be mined. Bitcoin's rise yesterday back to $50,000 from summer lows below $30,000 could add a further incentive for miners. ""It's like we've doubled the number of machines we have,"" said Fiorenzo Manganiello, the founder of private equity company Lian Group, which owns one of the largest renewable bitcoin mining farms in Europe. Hut 8 Mining has been one of the companies benefiting. It notched up a 241 per cent boom in mining revenues in the second quarter, raking in C$31.4m ($25m) with its chief executive noting that June and July proved to be bumper months as a result of China's move. Mining profits registered C$19.3m over the period from C$697,000 in the same period last year. ""Following China's ban on domestic miners, global [production] fell by approximately 40 to 50 per cent and, at Hut 8, we started mining approximately 40 to 50 per cent more bitcoin with no directly attributable cost increase,"" Downey said.    UK-based mining company Argo Blockchain also reported a 180 per cent increase in revenues in the first half of 2021, citing a change in global mining conditions that allowed it to produce more digital coins without increasing the number of machines it uses. Pre-tax profit soared to £10.7m compared with £523,074 in the first half of 2020. Sam Doctor, chief of strategy at US digital asset specialist BitOoda, estimated that it would take about 18 months for capacity to return to preban levels. Replacing the lost capacity will take time because it involves upgrading power infrastructure and building new facilities. Miners from China have tried to migrate to neighbouring countries such as Mongolia and Kazakhstan but many are unable to transport the equipment across borders. There are also concerns about the stance authorities will take about bitcoin mining in these new hubs. Bitcoin mining has a severe environmental impact. It accounts for 0.4 per cent of the world's energy consumption and it uses more electricity annually than Finland or Belgium, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Miners in China had a particularly large effect due to their reliance on coal-powered energy. ""As things stand today, we believe cryptocurrencies have a long way to go to satisfy ESG criteria,"" said analysts at French asset manager Candriam in a recent report, referring to investment standards pertaining to environmental, social and governance issues. Outside of China, mining activity is gravitating towards places with abundant sources of renewable energy, such as Norway and Canada. But as demand exploded, specialist site operators have found it hard to build new facilities rapidly enough. ""It will take about a year or more for mining capacity to recover,"" said Kjetil Hove Pettersen, chief executive of Norwegian miner and datacentre operator KryptoVault. ""There is a lot of new mining equipment being sent to the US and Canada instead of China but datacentre capacity is a bottleneck."" In the US, Texas has been one of the key beneficiaries of the new landscape while specialist sites in Norway and other European countries are buckling under demand. ""We have people calling us and begging us to accept their machines,"" Manganiello added. ""Some have offered 50 per cent of their future profits if we give them space in our datacentres."" The price and quality of computers required for mining new units has also declined. Before China's crackdown, miners had to pay ever increasing prices for their computers as they searched for more efficient ways to acquire bitcoins. Due to the glut of servers collecting dust in China, the price of computers has collapsed and barriers to making money have become lower. ""Right now, the profitability of bitcoin mining is so high that even the oldest, least efficient machine can be profitable,"" said Hove Pettersen. 'As things stand today, we believe crypto has a long way to go to satisfy ESG criteria'"
f9480f3f6ce979c48d5b,2021-08-23,Companies can stop the ESG backlash,"The momentum behind environmental, social and governance-themed investing has seemed unstoppable for the past few years. Trillions of dollars have poured into ESG funds and countless executives have renounced Milton Friedman's shareholder primacy dictum, in a oncein-a-generation shift in the business consensus. Now the backlash has begun. In recent weeks, a former BlackRock sustainable investing chief branded ESG a ""deadly distraction"" from real policy reforms, while an executive fired by Deutsche Bank's asset management arm called its sustainability claims harmful posturing. UK regulators are circling ""greenwashing"" brands which make misleading claims about their environmental virtues, echoing the US Securities and Exchange Commission's recent alert about the risks posed to investors by funds' fuzzy definitions of ESG. To top it off, two Harvard Law School professors marked the second anniversary of the US Business Roundtable's landmark endorsement of stakeholder governance by concluding that its statement had been ""mostly for show"". The groups targeted by these critiques have rejected them, sometimes convincingly. Many business leaders who see themselves in the vanguard of a revolution in capitalism seem genuinely perplexed to discover that others think they are part of the problem. As more multinationals raise workers' wages, diversify their boardrooms, purge their supply chains of environmental or human rights abuses and set ""net zero"" emissions targets, they wonder why critics are not cheering them on for voluntarily moving in the right direction. There are several answers. First, those who suspect business of greenwashing or hypocrisy have not been short of fuel, from flimsily defined ESG funds stuffed with oil and gas stocks to the lobbying from companies that do not want to disclose their contributions to a warming climate. Second, ESG has become politicised. Many on the left doubt that capitalists can set their own house in order and suspect that they are embracing voluntary tweaks to their business models to avoid harsher regulations or taxes. Many on the right assail CEOs as virtue-signalling ""woke capitalists"", increasingly adrift of the US conservative mainstream on subjects from vaccines to voting rights. But the biggest reason for the backlash may be impatience with the fact that business leaders who have spent years touting their social and environmental responsibilities have not had a more tangible impact. As employees and consumers are confronted with daily evidence of entrenched inequality, failing institutions and an increasingly unstable climate, some are asking why this supposed revolution has not yielded bigger improvements. Growing self-congratulation in boardrooms has been mirrored by increasing public dissatisfaction. Polling by Morning Consult suggests that fewer people now trust corporate America than the news media, while the percentage of Americans telling Gallup they have little or no trust in big business is back to the peak reached in the global financial crisis. Impatience about corporate footdragging on diversity, political spending, reducing emissions and reining in executive pay has also been palpable in this year's record crop of ESG-themed shareholder resolutions in the US.    With companies now held to account for their stewardship of human and natural, as well as financial, capital, the need to prove that rhetoric will be backed up by real change looks increasingly urgent. How, then, should a self-professed stakeholder capitalist respond? Some will not shake off the claims of greenwashing easily. ESG has always been blighted by hype and wooliness, with too many of its adherents content to sign non-committal pledges and scatter pictures of sunflowers through reports about elusive concepts such as ""purpose"". More transparency, better data and greater accountability are badly overdue. They are now within reach, through initiatives such as the proposed International Sustainability Standards Board. Standardising the inconsistent mess of non-financial metrics now looks essential for boosting confidence that they do, in fact, create value. Executives who understand this still have time to get ahead of the coming disclosure changes, working with regulators to ensure tough new mandatory reporting requirements. But they should not get too lost in the accounting standards weeds. A simple principle should guide their response to the ESG backlash: that the world needs to see evidence that their lavishly marketed efforts are having a material impact. Impact investing itself defines a relatively small corner of the financial sector. But the principle of focusing on a company's effects on people and the planet is one that can be applied more widely. Whether stakeholder capitalism will live up to its billing is still debatable, but it would be counter-productive to write off all ESG efforts as empty or harmful. Regardless of your view on the power large companies wield, harnessing it still seems one of the most promising ways to address our greatest collective challenges. But to beat the backlash, ESG must be held to a higher standard, with a more honest focus on its impact. andrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com Growing boardroom self-congratulation has been mirrored by rising public dissatisfaction"
3356bcd456a9efb8dbf3,2021-08-23,Investors still making bets on City's office market,"Property. Post-pandemic sentiment Demand for the best space has held up but some fear risks from continued homeworking London's offices are almost deserted and no one knows when people will return, yet some investors are busy making bets on the capital's workspace. ""People we haven't spoken to since the last recession are popping up with pockets full of money saying: we did well last time, what can we get now?"" said Mat Oakley, head of European commercial property research at Savills real estate company. The question is whether this confidence is well placed or reckless. The sharp fall in the value of new offices predicted for the pandemic has not yet come to pass. At the same time, sales of office developments have slowed but, where they have happened, prices are at or above pre-Covid levels and competition has been fierce, according to property agents and market data. ""Lots of people are looking for office bargains, but they are not there,"" said Oakley. Shares in London's largest listed developers, Land Securities, British Land, Helical, Derwent London and Great Portland Estates, have risen 15-30 per cent in the past six months and are approaching pre-pandemic levels. Those developers are optimistic, insisting their new and well-equipped buildings will remain popular even if employers decide in any number that their staff can work at home. Some investors seem persuaded, others less so. ""Agents and valuers who think nothing has changed have their heads in the sand,"" said Zachary Gauge, who leads UBS's European real estate strategy and research. Vacancy rates in the City of London have risen from 5.3 per cent in March 2020 to 9 per cent in June this year, but the empty space is mostly in older stock and rents in new offices have held firm, according to Savills. The 2016 Brexit vote slowed down office-building, keeping a lid on new supply coming into the pandemic. Without that, vacancy rates might have been even higher, said William Beardmore-Gray, head of commercial agency and London offices at Knight Frank. Demand for the best space has also held up: video app TikTok, property company JLL and law firms Travers Smith and Skadden have committed to London offices in the past few months. While retailers and hospitality venues have struggled with rent, office tenants have largely continued to pay, supporting landlords' cash flows and sparing them the value destruction seen in other types of commercial property. Much will hinge on what level of occupancy workplaces eventually return to.    According to Remit Consulting, London offices were at 11.5 per cent of capacity on average in the week ending August 6. The number of people coming to work each day has hardly changed since the government lifted coronavirus restrictions on July 19 and many businesses have pushed the date for any large-scale return to work far into the autumn. Because office leases tend to have a five to 15 year term, few companies have yet had a chance to exit their contract. But while some businesses are signing up for new offices, others have already said they will cut space and allow more homeworking. In February, HSBC announced plans to reduce its global office space by 40 per cent. Santander has signalled it will shut some satellite offices and several other banks and professional services firms, including JPMorgan, Nationwide, Société Générale, KPMG and PwC have put hybrid working arrangements in place. Smaller businesses are also changing the way they work. Many are trying to save money by subletting unused space. There is currently 5.6m square feet of space for subletting on the market, almost double the pre-pandemic level, according to Savills. The glut of sublet space, which is often offered at a discount, will put pressure on rents in that part of the market. But investors are betting that demand for ""prime"" offices will remain high even if it falls lower down the market. That is one reason that the value of Derwent's £5.4bn portfolio of high quality offices has started to increase. Property agents and landlords call this a ""bifurcation"" of the market and argue rents for some types of offices can sink without dragging down the rest. Marina Petroleka, global head of ESG research at Fitch Ratings, doubted that this hybrid working ""will hit every landlord with varying degrees of intensity"". In a June report, co-authored with Euan Gatfield, she predicted that the pandemic had created ""a structural shift rather than a cyclical or temporary event for the London office market"". The uncertainty does not seem to be holding back investment though and when overseas travel restrictions lift, Asian and US buyers are expected to target London. According to Oakley, investment decisions are being ""driven by the weight of money rather than any improvement in [investors'] perception of market fundamentals"". With bond yields and interest rates so low, a 4 per cent yield on a London office looks attractive. But lack of demand, the high costs of upgrading buildings to meet stricter environmental standards or falling rents could quickly wipe out that income. ""Current market conditions seem in many ways to be disconnected to the number of risks that are bubbling under the surface ... we're not going back to the old days,"" said Gatfield."

NN unit handles $355bn in assets Goldman Sachs' asset management unit has agreed to buy Dutch insurer NN Group's investment management arm for about €1.6bn, marking the Wall Street bank's largest acquisition since David Solomon became chief executive in 2018. The deal for NN Investment Partners, which has $355bn of assets under management, will expand Goldman's presence in European asset management and is the latest example of the consolidation sweeping the industry. It is a further sign of Solomon's determination to expand the bank in areas that earn regular fees, such as asset and wealth management, while reducing its reliance on volatile businesses such as equities and bond trading. Solomon said the acquisition ""helps us scale our asset management platform, particularly by strengthening our position in Europe"". Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which has $2.3tn in assets under supervision, beat Frankfurt-based asset manager DWS in the final round of bidding to clinch NN Investment Partners. UBS Asset Management, Janus Henderson and US insurer Prudential Financial had also registered interest. ""Everything that NN does, we already do, and this is adding and accelerating our growth ... and continues to help us scale,"" said Solomon. Asset managers are pursuing scale to shield profits from rising costs and falling fees. Solomon said Goldman would ""certainly take a serious look"" at further acquisitions in asset management, if they could accelerate its growth. ""The asset management industry continues to consolidate. If you look at most of the leading players, the thing that most of them have is their businesses are global and at scale."" Of NN Investment Partners' assets under management, $190bn is managed on behalf of its parent, with the remainder run for external investors. NN Group will become a client of GSAM, bringing the amount of outsourced insurance advisory business that it manages to $550bn. ""Being a partner with the NN Group on their insurance assets going forward was an attractive opportunity for us,"" said Solomon. NN Investment Partners has a strong position in environmental, social and governance investing, notably in areas such as green bonds, impact equity and sustainable equity. ""We're focused on responding to our clients' needs and desires around ESG,"" said Solomon. Goldman reported record revenue from asset management in the second quarter, but only about a quarter of it came from managing assets on behalf of clients, the part of the business it wants to expand. The bulk of the revenue was generated by investments that Goldman had made with its own capital, a source of income that the bank is trying to shrink. NN Group, which is based in The    Hague, came under pressure last year from hedge fund Elliott Management to improve returns and streamline operations. It said in April it was considering options for its investment management business, including a merger, joint venture or a partial divestment of the division, which has more than 900 employees in 15 countries.

0d0ee2dfc24afdc0c5d5,2021-08-20,Private equity's public reckoning remains unfinished business,"How times change. In 2007, private equity titans were hauled in front of parliament to answer questions about their excessive use of debt, aggressive cost-cutting and dubious tax breaks. Amid accusations that the sector was secretive and defensive, David Rubenstein, the founder and managing director of Carlyle Group, told a European conference in the same year that the industry had failed to explain what it did. Private equity groups, he said, needed to be more transparent, in keeping with public responsibilities that came with their size. That plea for a shift towards education and openness was such a roaring success that 14 years later the UK is having broadly the same conversation. A wave of private equity takeovers, particularly of mid-market companies, has prompted fierce criticism of the industry, as well as soul-searching about the health of UK public markets. And if anything, private equity's image problem has become more complicated. Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, the US buyout firm, is expected to return with another bid for Wm Morrison, the supermarket, ahead of a deadline today, to top the offer from a consortium led by Fortress that has already increased its bid this month. Once upon a time it was considered poor form for private equity firms to bid against each other: why drive up the price and push down the returns? But when the sector is sitting on more than $2tn in unspent funds, socalled dry powder, then perhaps the deals on offer inevitably get crowded. CD&R and Fortress aren't just slugging it out on price. Yes, CD&R would have to top its rival's offer of 272p a share, a more than 50 per cent premium to Morrisons' price before takeover interest emerged ? a share price that had been stagnant for five years. It's a racing certainty that CD&R would also match the commitments made by Fortress about how it would run the supermarket, maintain its 85 per cent freehold portfolio of stores, and treat its 120,000 employees, its suppliers and pension fund. In a world of stakeholder M&A and competitive bidding, private equity groups themselves increasingly have to cultivate a public image beyond their returns stats, as they make their pitch. Hence CD&R, which hails from the stuffier industrialist end of private equity, has emphasised its record with B&M, the UK retailer, and a model that relies on revenue growth and enhanced profitability for 80 per cent of returns. No wonder. At the moment, it has been outmanoeuvred in the responsible buyer stakes by the commitments from Fortress, despite its rival hailing from the racier hedge fund and distressed debt tradition in the sector. Fortress presents itself as a financial investor supporting existing management and backed by long-term money from the likes of CPP, the Canadian pension fund. In reality, the pair are highlighting their finer qualities, while a growing chorus shouts that neither should allowed to buy the UK household name, full stop. It isn't fair to say that nothing has changed in the past 14 years. Larger, publicly listed groups increased scrutiny of the sector. The Walker guidelines on private equity disclosure in 2007 were an (admittedly weak) attempt defuse transparency concerns, with the    Wates corporate governance principles another voluntary effort. There will be more to come: pressure around ESG issues is mounting from end investors in private equity funds and the UK wants to impose stricter requirements on the largest private companies, as proposed under its corporate governance overhaul. Some in the sector privately concede that the last serious bout of private equity angst was defused by the credit crunch, which torpedoed take-private transactions and shifted attention to the banks and the impending meltdown of the financial system. Private equity's troubles today reflect that the task identified by Rubenstein went largely unfinished. helen.thomas@ft.com Pressure around ESG issues is mounting from end investors in private equity funds"
17dc6506f7d02f6547a5,2021-08-18,Alberta's oil producers hurtle to a bleak future,"Despite record output, Canadians hit stumbling block of US and investor qualms over carbon-intensive heavy crude The White House call for more oil from Saudi Arabia and Russia last week caused alarm in Alberta, the Canadian province that is by far the biggest foreign oil supplier to the US. The request came just two months after Joe Biden, the US president, revoked a critical permit, leading to the demise of the Keystone XL pipeline. The $8bn project, meant to carry heavy crude from Alberta's oil sands to Texas, had faced years of fierce environmental opposition. ""Why is the US government blocking energy imports from friendly Canada, while pressing for more imports from Opec dictatorships & Putin's Russian regime?"" Jason Kenney, Alberta's premier, asked on Twitter. Alberta is home to the world's thirdbiggest oil deposit and has pinned its economic future on increasing exports to its southern neighbour. Yet new oil sands projects in Alberta, among the most carbon-intensive on earth, are in trouble as governments pledge decarbonisation, UN-sponsored scientists warn of a worsening climate crisis and Wall Street sours on fossil fuels. Extracting bitumen from Canada's oil sands is an energy-intensive way to produce crude. Despite efficiency improvements, CO2-equivalent emissions are still higher than most other sources of oil. Oil sands emissions rose almost 140 per cent between 2005 and 2019, to 83m tonnes a year, or more than 10 per cent of Canada's total, according to the country's submission to the UN. Despite the cancellation of Keystone XL, Alberta's oil output mostly from the oil sands hit a record high in the first half of the year, averaging 3.5m barrels a day as projects increased following last year's price crash and the province lifted production quotas. But capital spending in Canada's oil and gas sector has plunged from a high of C$81bn ($65bn) seven years ago to just over C$27bn this year, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. The trend suggests lower production growth in future. Tim McMillan, Capp's president, blames Justin Trudeau's federal Liberal government for policies he says have had a ""dampening"" effect on investment, such as the federal carbon tax and a new law to stiffen environmental oversight of new energy projects such as pipelines. Oil analysts say that broader forces are more significant, including doubts about longer-term demand, the effects of last year's price crash and policy shifts against fossil fuels. BlackRock, the asset manager, for example, lumps the oil sands industry in with civilian firearms, tobacco and other pariah sectors. Some insurers are pulling away and several banks have said they will not finance new projects.    ""If governments get serious about their net-zero targets, [then] high-cost and ESG-sensitive supplies like the Canadian oil sands cannot grow, and their continued existence comes into question,"" said Al Salazar, vice-president of intelligence at consultancy Enverus. For now, the consensus is that the oil sands will expand much more slowly than expected a decade ago, when international oil companies joined a latterday gold rush to northern Alberta. Alex Pourbaix, chief executive of Cenovus Energy, Canada's second-largest producer, said his company was using cash flowing in from this year's higher oil prices to eliminate debt and pay back shareholders. Small expansions at existing assets would account for any growth. ""It will be without those giant kind of capital projects,"" he said. Suncor Energy told investors that it would pursue ""value over volume"" until 2025. Canadian Natural Resources, the country's biggest producer, plans only a modest increase in spending. Kevin Birn, chief analyst for the Canadian oil market at consultancy IHS Markit, reckons that oil sands production will at best rise another 650,000 b/d by 2030, if projects are optimised. Companies could divert cash not to growth but to decarbonising operations, Birn argued. The five largest Canadian producers recently proposed a C$75bn decarbonisation project that includes carbon capture, utilisation and storage and the potential use of small-scale nuclear technology to eliminate emissions from operations. Forrest said federal and provincial measures including the carbon tax, a clean fuel standard and a forthcoming tax credit should make decarbonisation attractive to operators. ""Assuming the Liberals get in again, we'll have enough clarity and the policy will be there and we'll see significant investments,"" she said. On Sunday, Trudeau called a snap election for September 20. If they can be greened, supporters say a golden era awaits the oil sands, as stuttering US shale production and underinvestment in supplies elsewhere increase the strategic value of deposits in western, open countries. ""By the end of the decade, Canada is going to be a quarter of free-world oil,"" said Adam Waterous, head of Waterous Energy Fund, a Calgary private equity firm. Critics say Alberta is banking on rosy outlooks for global oil demand that cannot transpire if the world meets emissions targets. The province recently lost a supreme court battle to stop Canada's carbon tax, has investigated environmentalists' funding and created a unit to beat back critics. Its Twitter account said that last week's UN climate warning contained ""apocalyptic rhetoric"". ""Alberta has not internalised that oil demand is in decline and that ever-worsening projections about climate impacts ... have fundamentally changed the outlook,"" said Simon Dyer, deputy executive director of the Pembina Institute, a clean energy think-tank. 'Projections about climate impacts ... have fundamentally changed the outlook' 'If governments get serious about net-zero targets, supplies like the Canadian oil sands cannot grow'"

Launched in 2006 by the late Kofi Annan, former UN secretary-general, PRI has grown into a top standards setter for sustainable investing. Almost all the world's large pension funds, asset managers and even some blank-cheque companies have signed on to its voluntary requirements. Now, PRI has run into trouble, telling members in an August 2 message that it won't require them to report on how they measure up to its standards until 2023, rather than next year as planned. PRI overhauled its reporting process last year to be harder to satisfy but simpler to submit. That overhaul was ""too ambitious"", it admitted as it apologised ""for this mistake"". PRI is delaying the start of its first full reporting period until early 2023, while postponing additional minimum requirements for members and engagement with signatories who do not meet those requirements in 2021. ""It's important for PRI to get this right but until 2023 seems a long time to get things sorted out,"" said Bob Eccles, a visiting professor at Oxford university's Saïd Business School. PRI's signatories had long complained about the technical difficulties with reporting on the PRI interface. Sources also said the portal was only open for a limited period of time in the first quarter when most companies were scrambling to finish year-end audits. The debacle will raise doubts for asset managers who have touted their PRI bona fides in regulatory filings. PRI's problems are likely to embolden ESG sceptics, such as the SEC's Hester Peirce, who have argued that additional reporting would be too expensive and complex.

aaf08f229d1bcb9c5d0b,2021-08-13,Philip Morris triumphs in £1bn bidding war for Vectura,"? Inhaler group's board supports PMI ? Health campaigners condemn deal The board of UK inhaler maker Vectura has agreed to support a £1bn takeover offer from cigarette company Philip Morris International after a fierce bidding war, despite concerted lobbying by health groups. Vectura's board said yesterday that PMI's offer was ""fair and reasonable"" and would give shareholders a higher price than a rival bid from the US private equity firm Carlyle. The tobacco company plans to ""increase research and development investment and to operate Vectura as an autonomous business unit"", the board said in a statement, adding that it would now recommend the offer to shareholders. It will need approval of just over 50 per cent to succeed. PMI has said it wants to buy Vectura to expand revenues in its ""beyond nicotine"" business as it attempts to reduce its reliance on cigarette sales. Its bid sharpens what one top-20 Vectura shareholder this week described as a dilemma. ""Many of our investors want us to be able to show we're putting ESG up there"" alongside financial returns, he said ahead of the board's announcement. ""It's a very difficult one."" He said he feared that selling to the tobacco group might enable it to use Vectura as ""window dressing"" or for ""greenwashing"". A PMI spokesman hit back at ""critics of the transformation of the tobacco industry"". The company ""has been very clear about its strategy to leave cigarettes behind"". Smoke-free products now accounted for 28 per cent of PMI's revenues, up from ""almost zero"" in 2015, he said. PMI has offered 165p per share for Vectura, compared with Carlyle's 155p offer. Carlyle this week appealed to shareholders to back its lower bid, citing the possible impact on ""wider stakeholders"" of selling the company to a tobacco business. Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said the organisation was ""extremely shocked and concerned"" by the board's decision to support the PMI bid. ""It's totally absurd that PMI could make more money from providing treatments to the very people they have made ill in the first place,"" she added. A group of 26 health charities, public health experts and doctors wrote to the board ahead of its decision, saying Vectura's ""future commercial viability as a company dedicated to improving respiratory health would be seriously jeopardised should the PMI takeover proceed"". The letter said the global health community ""utterly rejected"" the notion that PMI was becoming a wellness company. Axa Investment Managers, TIG Advisers and Berry Street Capital Management, which together own 11.2 per cent of Vectura shares, had made a commitment to back Carlyle unless a rival offered 10 per cent more.    Axa signed a ""tobacco-free finance pledge"" in 2018, saying it would divest from the industry because its products were a ""major threat to public health"". PMI did not raise its bid to meet that threshold by a 5pm deadline yesterday. Carlyle and PMI had been in a bidding war for several weeks but Carlyle said this week that it would no longer compete with PMI on price. JPMorgan and Rothschild & Co advised Vectura. 'Many ... investors want us to be able to show we're putting ESG up there. It's a very difficult one'"
a25fb3c59f95d5c2661b,2021-08-12,Chesapeake buys rival Vine for $2.2bn,"Oil & gas Combination to hold commanding position in Haynesville Shale Chesapeake Energy, the US shale pioneer that collapsed during last year's oilprice crash only to emerge from bankruptcy in February, has agreed to buy rival natural gas producer Vine Energy for $2.2bn in equity and cash. The combined company, worth $9bn including debt, will hold a commanding position in the Haynesville Shale, a rock formation rich in natural gas in northwestern Louisiana, close to the growing US liquefied natural gas industry on the Gulf of Mexico coast. ""Chesapeake has the scale and operating expertise to quickly become the dominant supplier of responsibly sourced gas to premium markets in the Gulf Coast and abroad,"" said Mike Wichterich, interim chief executive. The deal, which comes less than five months after Vine went public in a New York listing, will increase Chesapeake's total production from slightly more than 400,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent to almost 600,000 boe/d. Wichterich said that all the company's Haynesville gas would be ""responsibly sourced"" independently certified as produced in accordance with environmental, social and governance metrics, including reduced methane emissions. US shale operators are trying to reduce their operations' greenhouse gas emissions ahead of anti-methane measures expected from the EU and in response to pressure from ESG-focused investors. Under the deal, 92 per cent equity with the rest cash, Vine shareholders will receive 0.2486 Chesapeake shares and $1.20 for each Vine share, equating to $15 a share. Vine's shares closed at $14.88 on Tuesday. Blackstone, the private equity firm that controls about 70 per cent of Vine's shares, will vote for the deal and become one of Chesapeake's largest stakeholders, with slightly less than 10 per cent of the company's outstanding shares, according to Wichterich. The deal gave the restructured Chesapeake scale while preserving its finances, said Wichterich. ""We will not break the balance sheet. We are not the old Chesapeake."" The US shale patch is consolidating after last year's oil crash, which prompted bankruptcies and forced operators to shut wells and slash planned capital spending. More than $30bn in shale deals went through in the second quarter and analysts expect more M&A as operators buy new production rather than drill for it. Oil and gas groups including Chesapeake, known in recent years for profligate expansion through debtfuelled drilling, have vowed that an era of capital discipline has arrived in the sector.    Chesapeake said on Tuesday it would pay 50 per cent of its free cash flow to shareholders each quarter, starting next year. The Vine acquisition would allow Chesapeake's base dividend to increase 27 per cent, the company said. Chesapeake declared bankruptcy last June after years of struggling under debt amassed by Aubrey McClendon, its founder, who died in a 2016 car accident a day after being indicted on charges of rigging bids for drilling rights."
45602e69897363ceaa44,2021-08-11,Moves by Philip Morris should be welcomed,"Letters The ""furious reaction of anti-smoking and medical groups"" is apparently supposed to convince the board of Vectura that selling to Philip Morris International cannot be in the best interests of the company (""Vectura auction does not let board off the hook"", August 10). It's right to ask about PMI's motives, but shouldn't the claims of campaign groups be questioned as well? Why shouldn't tobacco companies be involved in respiratory research, and wouldn't it be irresponsible of them not to be? If Vectura's drugs provided the best treatment, would it be ethical of clinicians to refuse to prescribe them? If society wants tobacco companies to change in a way which moves beyond the simple and platitudinous ""they should just stop selling cigarettes then"" we should be welcoming moves like PMI's, even if that challenges our heuristics for what's good and what's bad. I'm a PMI shareholder who takes responsible investment seriously, and I hope the Vectura shareholders who profess to weigh ESG factors in their decision-making will resist the temptation to outsource their ethics to those who shout the loudest.

eb05d7f6a1d1bdf14218,2021-08-10,IPCC/carbon offsets: branch line,"Twitter: @FTLex Humankind must do better, according to the latest report card from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Even as companies try to limit and offset carbon emissions, by paying to plant or preserve trees, their investments are going up in smoke. The document has arrived at a time when forest fires are raging in California, Siberia and Greece. Fund managers overseeing $43tn of assets have pledged to meet net zero emission targets by 2050. Some companies have responded by buying offsets backed by forests. Trees globally absorb an estimated 7.6bn metric tonnes of carbon net a year. Oil producers are among the most enthusiastic investors. In late 2016, for example, BP bought over 13m forestry-based annual carbon credits from indigenous peoples in Washington state at more than $8 per tonne. Superficially, that looked smart. BP plans its projects using an internal carbon price of $100 per tonne by 2030. The EU emission market is pricing carbon credits at $67 per tonne. With these sort of price gaps, BP is theoretically saving far more than half a billion dollars annually. Royal Dutch Shell has done something similar, connecting carbon credits to specific projects. The scale of recent forest fires suggests risks are higher than oil majors anticipated. The Colville Reservation in Washington State has been ravaged. That could threaten its value to BP. Offset projects generally have a buffer of 10-15 per cent to allow for natural disasters. It is unclear whether this covers recent damage. The last sizeable conflagration in 2015 wiped out a fifth of available timber on the Colville Reservation, according to a lawsuit. Companies try to diversify carbon offset risks by including assets such as mangrove swamps. Moreover, offsets tend to be expensed against project cash flows, according to Oswald Clint at Bernstein Research. Financial writedowns are unlikely. But plainly a business cannot legitimately tell ESG investors that a project is carbon neutral if offsets have been literally carbonised. The onus is on businesses to account as transparently for carbon reduction as they do for profits. Fund management groups must hold them to account. It is no longer enough for groups to cover their environmental responsibilities by publishing a fluffy report once a year replete with scenic photos and vague metrics."
a51759dc190036d16aef,2021-08-07,On Wall Street Bond investors need to step up on human rights,"institutional investors have made big strides in trying to tackle climate change through their investments. They now need to show similar progress on human rights. Pressure from investors has helped drive companies such as Unilever and Spanish airports group Aena to offer shareholders regular votes on efforts to tackle climate change, while institutional investors are pushing big US tech firms to disclose more about environmental risks. But when it comes to human rights, it is a different story. A Financial Times investigation last month showed that fund firms with strong rhetoric about tackling human rights abuses were also lending money to regimes carrying out abuses. Often there was little sign that they were raising these issues when talking to these countries. What is more, activists with experience of such abuses had little success in getting some firms even to respond to their requests for help. In fairness, tackling this issue is not straightforward, for two reasons. First, bonds offer investors fewer natural points of engagement than equities, where there are shareholder meetings and more informal conversations with management. And when they do, talking to a government's representatives on a bond roadshow is not the same as talking directly to a company's chief executive. Second, while some human rights abuses may be clear cut, other situations can be more complicated. Fund managers have tended to prefer focusing on climate change, a topic that many Western investors agree on and where progress can be quantified. When you have an investor base from different parts of the world, deciding which social values you should prioritise can be trickier. ""The E and G [of ESG] are fairly clear cut,"" says Daniel Harris, partner at law firm Chancery Advisors, talking about environmental, social and governance investing. ""When it gets to the S, that's the Wild West, there's no consensus."" He adds that ""investors are routinely applying double standards"", for instance by turning a blind eye to China and Russia, while taking aim at other countries ""by invoking a home-made version of international law based on emotion and politics"". Much of this is rooted in the age-old problem of the finance industry: a lack of accountability. Whose responsibility is it to push these issues? Asset managers often argue they are merely carrying out the requests of investors. Consultants to investors like pension funds see their duty as providing the framework to consider all the issues, not pushing clients to change their beliefs. Investors, in turn, may not know or have the time to examine every single security that their fund managers are investing in. ""If you've got half an hour in a trustee meeting to question a manager, there's no guarantee that everything will be put on the table in that space of time,"" said Joanne Holden, global head of investment research at Mercer. But a large part of the problem is also how ESG has come to be viewed in the asset management industry. Many fund managers focus on ESG risks. What that means in practice is that ESG is used as a way of spotting previously under-appreciated risks and reducing the chance of losing money. For instance, if a government crackdown on its opponents leads to civil unrest, that could hit the price of the country's bonds.    Guidance given to investors has been in that direction. The Law Commission's review of fiduciary duties, for instance, states that ""where trustees think ethical or environmental, social or governance (ESG) issues are financially material they should take them into account"". But while focusing on ESG risks can make investment firms appear virtuous, it does not always tackle the underlying ESG problem. Take Uzbekistan, where concerns have grown over the pace of reform and the state of human rights. An ""ESG risk"" approach would overlook the case of 69-year-old former diplomat Kadyr Yusupov. Yusupov was put in a tiny prison cell infested with scorpions and snakes and subjected to alleged psychological torture, in spite of a UN working group's call for his immediate release. His case is unlikely to move the price of Uzbekistan's bonds. But that does not mean fund managers should not be raising it when they talk to the country's representatives. Taking a stance on human rights and sovereign bonds will be an even bigger challenge for institutional investors than pushing companies over their climate impact. And it could, at least in the short term, cost them returns. But as Adam Gillett, head of sustainable investments at Willis Towers Watson, notes: ""Just because it's tricky doesn't mean it shouldn't be done."" laurence.fletcher@ft.com Fund managers have tended to prefer focusing on climate change, where progress can be quantified"
6f98d6ea43a9553366f9,2021-08-07,Taking Aim at a small-cap success story,"L ondon's Alternative Investment Market was traditionally a hunting ground for gung-ho private investors willing to take a punt on thinly traded small-cap stocks that could make or lose them a small fortune. But eight years ago, Aim found a higher purpose. It is now the go-to place if you want to reduce your inheritance tax bill. This week is the anniversary of reforms ushered in by former chancellor George Osborne that made it possible to hold Aim shares within a stocks and shares Isa. Designed to boost investment in small British companies, the tax-free attractions of Isas were yoked with the IHT loophole of business property relief (BPR). Intended to protect family businesses from ruinous tax bills, this IHT exemption also applies to certain Aim shares if held for over two years. Of course, BPR was never intended to benefit ageing ""Isa millionaires"", but plenty of their heirs will be spared a 40 per cent tax charge when they inherit these portfolios. What's more, the Isa wrapper means there hasn't been a penny of capital gains or dividend tax to pay despite the stonking performance of Aim shares in recent years. Thanks, George! Today, up to half a billion pounds a year flows into ""IHT Isas"" offered by specialist investment management companies such as Octopus, Unicorn and RC Brown, according to estimates by investment service Wealth Club. This trend has been boosted by the pandemic, as the tax liability of soaring equity valuations collides with fears of diminishing life expectancy. But IHT fever alone cannot account for the impressive outperformance of the alternative index. Since the pandemic nadir last March, the FTSE Aim 100 index has rebounded 107 per cent nearly two and half times the recovery achieved by the FTSE 100. Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK's biggest investment platform, says 2021 is ""on track to be the biggest ever year"" for Aim trading. Data from investment brokers show that tech, green energy and life sciences companies are the biggest draw for investors, alongside the commodities stocks with which Aim is more traditionally associated. When the Isa rules changed in 2014, just 18 Aim-listed companies had a market cap of £500m or more (a third were highly speculative mining or oil and gas exploration outfits, cementing Aim's reputation as a volatile market). Today, 68 stocks have passed the £500m point and spanning a range of sectors, they are arguably much more investable. Online retailers Asos and Boohoo are two of the most-bought Aim shares by Hargreaves Lansdown investors this year, having received a huge boost during the pandemic. Other tech picks outside the top 10 include GlobalData, which supplies thousands of governments and companies with data analytics, and identity data specialist GB Group, which claims to ID more than half the world's population. All have greatly increased their earnings recently.    ""The FTSE 100 is full of yesterday's companies, but if you invest in Aim you can get exposure to tomorrow's winners,"" says Alex Davies, chief executive of Wealth Club. On rival platform Interactive Investor, the green theme dominates. Hydrogen producer ITM Power is its bestselling Aim stock so far this year, with investors betting it will benefit from changing energy requirements in a more carbon neutral world. The same tailwinds are driving investors towards Ceres Power and Impax, an asset management house specialising in ESG. Two questions hang over Aim's outperformance. First, has this rally got further to run? And second, how far would any removal of the IHT advantages dent its popularity with investors? Simon Thompson, my former boss at Investors' Chronicle and compiler of its Bargain Shares Portfolio, says the small-cap bull run is far from over. ""The outperformance of smallcaps reflects the higher weighting in Aim indices to fast-growing sectors (technology, ecommerce and healthcare) that are beneficiaries of benign monetary and fiscal tailwinds it's that simple,"" he says. Simon highlighted the likely sectoral winners and losers from quantitative easing in his most recent book, Stock Picking for Profit. While he wouldn't claim to have predicted the pandemic, it has accentuated these gains as software and ecommerce companies exploit their prime positions and healthcare stocks benefit from government largesse. However, even Simon accepts that ""the easy money has been made"". He predicts the next stage of the rally will be largely driven by earnings momentum and rotation from growth to value stocks. Accordingly, his picks for the 2021 Bargain Shares Portfolio include Aimtraded mining, oil and gas companies, renewable energy, UK retailers, housebuilders and a royalties company. In its first six months, the portfolio has delivered a return of more than 20 per cent. As Aim has become bigger and more diverse, so too have its investors. Its ranks of fast-growing tech-enabled businesses have been pulling in the mainstream retail punters, while the growing size of Aim constituents has attracted more institutional money. Both would help cushion the blow if Aim's IHT advantage failed to survive post-Covid tax reforms. But if business property relief was limited, I do wonder how many investors would actually sell up. Some might switch to other taxadvantaged investments like VCTs or EIS, or simply give the money away (assuming the seven-year rule remains in place). But the loss of BPR would be of no long-term consequence to institutions or younger investors like me. For now, another key Aim theme is a surge in M&A activity. Simon Thompson notes the average market capitalisation of Aim companies is at an all-time high of £178m, although the number of listed companies has halved since 2007. This, he says, reflects their higher quality a factor that will undoubtedly tempt predators to run their slide rules.

122ed8d22ebf8a4750ac,2021-08-07,DWS adds green labels to ETFs,"FT MORAL MONEY Corporate name changes are often the focus of public snickering. Standard Life Aberdeen's switch to Abrdn in April, for example, was widely mocked. Last week, DWS, Deutsche Bank's asset management arm, announced the renaming of nine of its exchange traded funds to incorporate the environmental, social and governance (ESG) label. The move is part of a larger trend to appeal to ESG investors. JPMorgan and Amundi were among the companies that overhauled more than 250 conventional funds to add sustainability language and investment criteria in 2020, according to Morningstar. Companies that have failed to capture investor interest are now adding ""a coat of green paint"" on funds, says Ben Johnson, director of ETF research at Morningstar. The changes are ""an attempt to revitalise this particular product,"" Johnson said. DWS is also adding securities lending activities to the ETFs, the company said. Funds will often lend shares to short sellers to liven up returns, but the practice could raise concerns from ESG investors. In 2019, Hiro Mizuno, the former head of the world's largest pension fund, stopped lending out securities from the Japanese scheme because he believed shorting was antithetical to his mission of longterm value creation. Refurbishing existing funds to give them an ESG-friendly look has limitations, Johnson said. ""There are ESG-like exclusionary screens that are hardly what we would think of as best in class ESG intentional index strategies."" And renaming a fund to hoover up ESG money has caught the eye of regulators. Last week, Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler said he wanted the agency to revisit its ""names rule"", which prohibits funds from using materially deceptive or misleading names.

11cadf16d87970331640,2021-08-06,Glencore: black beauty,"Twitter: @FTLex Glencore shares have far outrun those of Rio Tinto and BHP in the past year. Part of the reason has to do with its coal exposure. Coal prices have rallied. Though Glencore profits did not capture that gain in the first half, coal could be a big contributor for the full year. Reflation concerns have done wonders for metal commodity prices. But the UK's largest listed miners could use a little pumping up themselves. Glencore and its peers trade on earnings valuations that are at decade lows. It should get a boost this year from coal, a commodity largely sold off by its peers. That, though, will make it tough to gain respect from the ESG crowd. Yesterday's debut first-half results under new chief executive Gary Nagle trumpeted improving financial fortunes. After a couple of tough years, the miner reported a sizeable surge in free cash flow to $5.4bn, nearly triple last year's figure. More surplus funds meant Glencore cut net debt to $10.6bn, or $31.8bn if offsets from easily sold inventories are ignored. This improvement, in turn, means bigger shareholder returns, an expected 21 cents per share for 2021 with buybacks. Then again, in 2018 it gave shareholders nearly double that figure. Without iron ore, Glencore has handed less to shareholders than Rio Tinto and Anglo American recently. More importantly, Glencore needs, and wants, to fix its image. Yet those focused on sustainable investing will still have reservations. At current prices, coal will contribute highly to full-year profits. The projected ebitda of $5.9bn trails only copper and exceeds the outlook for its entire trading arm. A boom in coal prices this year should make a big difference. This year's buyout of partners BHP and Anglo at the Cerrejón coal project in Colombia means more, not less, volumes to come. That is only part of the dirt. Legal and related costs, partly for investigations by the US Department of Justice under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, nearly quadrupled to $216m from last year. Last week, a former Glencore oil trader pleaded guilty to trying to bribe Nigerian government officials as well as money laundering. Glencore's Nagle will want to set a higher ethical bar and clean up its reputation. It has promised to cut carbon emissions by half in 2035, from 2019 levels. But given its engine room remains fuelled by coal, how much credit investors will give to its ESG efforts is suspect."

But the head of the Japanese electric vehicle pioneer says his company retains a head start in one crucial area: giving a second life to car batteries that are past their prime. Makoto Uchida said the group wanted to expand its knowhow in collecting lithium-ion batteries from old Leafs. The batteries are reused to store renewable energy at convenience stores and to power railroad crossings and delivery robots in factories. Such technologies to extend battery life and recycle materials are expected to pose a challenge in the industry's push to electrify fleets. ""There will be a lot of discussion in the coming days on how we take care of the total lifecycle assessment of the electric vehicle,"" Uchida said. ""Nissan has poured its energy into recycling from long before public debate began on this issue."" Nissan has sold more than 530,000 Leafs since the vehicle was launched in 2010, making the company one of the few carmakers to have electric vehicles on the road long enough for batteries to reach the end of their car life. Joji Tagawa, Nissan's chief sustainability officer, said: ""Tesla, Volkswagen and others are introducing EVs, but they are still far from receiving batteries. ""We have a lot of return batteries, and we have made a lot of trial-and-error on which battery will be used for which purpose."" Through 4R Energy, a venture between Nissan and trading house Sumitomo created the same year the Leaf was launched, the carmaker has studied ways of repurposing batteries to generate renewable energy in homes and buildings as well as for emergency power during natural disasters. The Leaf is made of materials that are 99 per cent recyclable. Nissan, part of an alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, has started rolling out similar initiatives in the UK and the US. The company is expected to strengthen its efforts as it seeks to electrify all its new vehicles in core markets by the early 2030s. Uchida's renewed focus on carbon neutrality and sustainability initiatives also comes after Japan's third-largest carmaker projected a return to profitability for the first time in three years. Since the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, former chair, in 2018, the company has implemented a restructuring to stem losses and overhauled governance. While its recovery was not complete, Uchida said the progress the company had made allowed management to focus again on longer-term efforts to achieve carbon neutrality.    In its sustainability report last week, Nissan introduced pay tied to environmental and social metrics such as human rights. While measures to incorporate ESG targets in pay are widespread in the US and Europe, Japanese companies are only now starting to introduce them. ""This year is going to be very important for me,"" he said. ""We showed this guidance, and we have to make sure to deliver it, but at the same time we want to give a message on our future growth."""
2a3865ad2540d3f1fc6b,2021-08-04,Japan Inc talks a good game on ESG but more action is needed,"INSIDE BUSINESS ASIA T wo days before the Tokyo Olympics launched with Naomi Osaka lighting the cauldron, the Japanese tennis star said on Twitter that she was proud to partner with Panasonic to ""champion progress"". The conglomerate and Tokyo 2020 appear to have chosen the 23-year-old, an advocate on everything from race to sport to womanhood to mental health, as a figurehead for similar reasons. Both the Japanese government and businesses are eager to portray themselves as open to diversity and change. The reality may be different, as an embarrassing string of scandals in the run-up to the Games has shown. But companies are under pressure to project a more progressive and socially conscious image with environmental, social and governance objectives suddenly high on boardroom agendas. It presents a challenge for the traditional Japanese approach to the world of sport marketing. For decades, sport presented a simple formula for advertising. Cheering athletes was almost a zero-risk strategy for companies to promote their products and brand. But with the rise of a generation of activist athletes that includes Osaka, footballer Marcus Rashford and basketball star LeBron James, sponsorship and branding using athletes is becoming more complex, requiring companies to take a stand on wider issues such as racial injustice and gender inequality. For Panasonic, its contract with Osaka as brand ambassador comes at a time when the 103-year-old group is trying to redefine its areas of growth and transition into a nimbler organisation under a new chief executive. In a diversity drive, it has hired talent from Google and Microsoft, while its general counsel, Laurence Bates, is openly gay in a country where LGBT people often suffer discrimination. Panasonic's willingness to embrace Osaka's activism is a further sign that it wants to break from its conservative past. But it faces risks that Nike wrestled with last summer when it encountered internal pushback against a video advertisement featuring athletes including Colin Kaepernick and Serena Williams. A group of black employees asked the company publicly to acknowledge its internal shortcomings on equality. It is time to harassment, dearth of and other plague workplaces Japanese groups will be expected to ensure that their employees have an equitable and inclusive workplace if they are to sell such ideals to consumers. They can no longer talk the talk without addressing harassment, overwork, the dearth of female managers and other problems that plague Japan's workplaces. As the Olympics enter their final week, the steady stream of medals won by Japanese athletes and increased media focus on actual sport has helped soften domestic opposition to the holding of the Games during the pandemic. This has made it easier for sponsors such as Asahi and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation to run related television adverts. Toyota has stuck to its decision not to run Olympics-related ads, but it has been actively promoting the Games on its internal website. The Games, however, continue to be overshadowed by an alarming rise in Covid cases across the nation. And a string of controversies before the start of the Games remains fresh in the memory, including the resignation of the    Tokyo 2020 chair over sexist remarks and the sacking of the director for the opening ceremony over a past joke on the Holocaust. The composer for the ceremony quit over comments about bullying a disabled student in his youth. The international scrutiny created by the Games may be temporary, but the problems of bullying, racism and sexual harassment remain pervasive across Japanese society. The issues will probably resurface sooner or later. When they do, silence and distancing the common approach taken by sponsors during the Olympics may not be sufficient. Toyota, Panasonic and others did eventually speak out against the sexism remarks made by the former Tokyo 2020 chair. But Tatsuo Sugimoto, a former Olympian and professor of sport economics at Hosei University, said companies needed to do more. ""When it's called for, sponsors need to exercise their rights to apply pressure on the sport itself,"" he said. As Tokyo 2020 comes to a close, it should not be a moment of relief for sponsors that the event did not turn into a public relations disaster. Instead, it should serve as a reminder that companies must live up to their proclaimed values for their marketing to be taken seriously. kana.inagaki@ft.com It is time to address harassment, overwork, the dearth of female managers and other problems that plague workplaces"
5353025268ff0bb7f359,2021-08-03,Business can be a force for change on climate,"A lmost 25 years ago, as chief executive of BP, I delivered a speech which acknowledged the risk posed by climate change, accepted that oil and gas companies were part of the problem, and made a pledge to become part of the solution. I was the first Big Oil CEO to do so, and was accused by my peers of having ""left the church"". But it was not long before others followed. A lot has changed since then. Climate change now ranks among the top concerns of people around the world. More than 125 countries representing almost 65 per cent of global GDP have made commitments to reduce their emissions to net zero by 2050, while companies with a market capitalisation of more than $20tn have set targets to do the same. The world is now awash with net-zero targets, 10-point plans and corporate sustainability policies, but is sorely lacking when it comes to delivery. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and the world is on a path to 3C of warming by the end of the century. This is why many people are rightly sceptical of claims about sustainability or ""ESG"", and are looking for ways to separate organisations that deliver on their promises from those engaged in greenwashing. It is urgent that we close this gap between ambition and reality. To have a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to a safe level of 1.5C, we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, and reduce them to net zero by 2050. That could require us to invest about $3.5tn dollars every year for the next 10 years. I am among those who used to think that the term ""climate crisis"" was an exaggeration. I was wrong. Fortunately, this is a crisis with known solutions. We already have the products and services we need to reduce emissions by more than 80 per cent, but many remain prohibitively expensive. Stronger public policy in the form of a carbon tax could help to level the playing field. But only business can take an idea from the laboratory or the engineer's workshop and transform it into a commercially viable climate solution. This is exactly what happened to renewable power generation over the past decade. Public policy set the stage, but engineers and businesses delivered the solutions. As a result of mass deployment and improvement, the prices of wind turbines and solar capacity fell by 40 per cent and 90 per cent respectively. In many places, they are now the cheapest source of new power generation capacity. We now need to apply the same feat to the whole range of solutions that will take us to net zero from hydrogen to heat pumps and from energy efficiency algorithms to electric vehicle charging software. There is a huge amount to do, but we do not need to go back to the laboratory for breakthroughs. We need to go into the field, apply what we have, improve it and grow it. That is why I have established BeyondNetZero, a new climate investing venture in partnership with the growth equity firm General Atlantic. Beyond- NetZero has two clear goals. The first is to provide the capital that entrepreneurs and rapidly growing companies need to scale up as they seek to deliver the next generation of climate solutions. The second is to avoid greenwashing. Instead of marking our own homework, we will work with independent experts Systemiq, who will help us to set ambitious net-zero targets, track progress against them, and verify that we are doing what we say we will do.    Business has a reputation for clinging to the past and greenwashing its way through the climate debate. But at its best, it can be at the forefront of progressive change because it is the best mechanism we have for delivery. Now is the time for businesses, and the investors who back them, to play a decisive role in the greatest challenge humanity is likely to face this century.

d7624a6fe1c692aa199a,2021-08-02,'Greenflation' threatens to derail climate action,"T he world faces a growing paradox in the campaign to contain climate change. The harder it pushes the transition to a greener economy, the more expensive the campaign becomes, and the less likely it is to achieve the aim of limiting the worst effects of global warming. New government-directed spending is driving up demand for materials needed to build a cleaner economy. At the same time, tightening regulation is limiting supply by discouraging investment in mines, smelters, or any source that belches carbon. The unintended result is ""greenflation"": rising prices for metals and minerals such as copper, aluminium and lithium that are essential to solar and wind power, electric cars and other renewable technologies. In the past, the transition to a new energy source provided a big boost to the old one. The advent of steam powerinspired the makers of sailing ships to innovate more in 50 years than they had in the previous 300. Electricity had a similar impact on gas lighting. Now, building green economies will consume more oil in the transition period, but producers are not responding the same way because political and regulatory resistance has darkened the future of fossil fuels. Even as oil prices rise, investment by the big hydrocarbon companies and countries continues to fall. Instead, oil powers are reinventing themselves as clean energy powers. One broker recently wrote that of his firm's 400 institutional clients, only one is still willing to invest in oil and gas. Even in shale oil, a corner of the market dominated by private players, rising prices are triggering an unusually weak rise in supply. Two of the most important metals for green electrification are copper and aluminium. But investment in these metals has also been depressed by environthat mental, social and governance issues. The world needs more copper to stop global warming, but environmentalists recently helped block a new Alaska mine over rival concerns: the impact on local communities and salmon. ESG used to be a luxury of rich nations. No longer. These pressures are restraining supplies even from Latin America, once the wild west of global mining. Almost 40 per cent of copper supply comes from Chile and Peru, and in both countries mining projects that used to take five years can now take 10 or more. One big copper project in Peru, scheduled to open in 2011, remains unfinished owing to resistance from the local community. This year alone, Chile has adopted two sweeping environmental rules and is considering a new royalty could make some of its biggest mines unprofitable. China's role as a big commodity supplier has also been turned on its head. A decade ago, China was still overproducing raw materials such as iron ore and steel and dumping the excess in foreign markets. Now, Beijing has cut production as part of its campaign to reach carbon neutrality. Nearly 60 per cent of aluminium comes from China, which recently capped new smelting because of its fat carbon footprint. This certainly looked like the green thing to do. Aluminium is one of the dirtiest metals to produce. Yet it is also one of the metals most vital to solar and other green energy projects, and it is set to face a particularly sharp increase in demand in coming decades, according to the World Bank. In the 2000s, analysts were bullish on commodity prices, owing to demand from China. Now, if they are bullish it is because of increasing demand from green projects. The green economy is the new China.    Renewable technologies require more wiring than the fossil fuel variety. Solar or wind power plants use up to six times more copper than conventional power generation. Over the past 18 months, as governments announced new green spending plans and pledges, analysts steadily increased their estimates for growth in demand for copper. Green regulation is thus spurring demand as it tightens supply, fuelling greenflation. Since the low point early last year, the price of copper is up more than 100 per cent, while aluminium is up 75 per cent. Unusually, their upward climb has barely weakened with recent signs of waning momentum in global growth. Solving this conundrum how to supply enough dirty old material to build a new green economy will require balance. Blocking new mines and oil rigs won't always be the environmentally and socially responsible move. Governments, and greens in particular, need to recognise that trying to shut down the old economy too fast threatens to push the price of building a cleaner one out of reach. The writer is Morgan Stanley Investment Management's chief global strategist Tightening regulation is limiting the supply of materials needed to build a cleaner economy"
ca50b65ed154173c79a2,2021-07-30,Bridgepoint golden hellos a challenge for investors,"J ust what an industry under fire needed. Private equity has been taking flak amid a wave of takeprivate deals for UK companies. The charge sheet is long (and not always fair): aggressive cost cutting, reckless use of debt, outsize rewards for those on the inside and a general sense the rules of engagement, particularly around governance, don't always apply. A high-profile listing of one of their own should have been a cause for celebration. Bridgepoint's shares surged on their first day of trading this month, reflecting strong interest in alternative investments and the rarity of a private equity group joining the premium ranks of the London market. Yet it was overshadowed by a governance bust-up that played into the worst stereotypes: sorry but the rules don't apply to us. First, Bridgepoint's executive chair William Jackson is staying in that role, something common among US-listed alternative investment groups but in contravention of City best practice. Second, the big name recruited as senior independent director, chair of Marks and Spencer Archie Norman, received a highly unusual signing-on bonus, or ""golden hello"", of £1.75m, on top of his annual fee of £200,000. Amid angst that onerous corporate governance rules are pushing listed companies into private hands, it is sporting of Bridgepoint to attempt to narrow the gap. In reality, it underlines the need to extend some of the more stringent regulations and disclosure requirements for listed companies to their private peers a key plank of the government's audit reform proposals. Sure, the company wanted a high calibre board; three other independent directors received payments of £500,000 too. The sums were, after tax, invested in the company's stock (which would have provided considerably better alignment with other shareholders if it had involved directors' own money). But the payments set a bad precedent and risk the board's credibility. The UK Corporate Governance Code is clear: independence is threatened where a director ""has received or receives additional remuneration from the company apart from a director's fee"". The fact Bridgepoint labelled the payments ""initial fees"" is perhaps no coincidence. And therein lies the problem. Under the ""comply or explain"" system, designed to give companies flexibility, shareholders can look forward to a discussion of this in the annual report, long after the point where it was a done deal. Everyone knows those explanations tend to be pointless boilerplate, something the regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, addressed earlier this year. Giving the FRC more powers to call out code breaches and insipid explanations is another welcome suggestion in the government's reforms. There has been much gnashing of teeth from institutional investors over the risk to London's reputation from a mooted overhaul of listing rules, which propose watering down free float requirements and allowing dual-class listing structures. There was vocal opposition to Deliveroo's listing, which eschewed premium status in favour of lower governance expectations.    But the job of enforcing the corporate governance code specifically falls to institutional shareholders, as part of the diligence and oversight exercised in investing clients' money. Which makes you wonder whether the stewardship teams at asset managers had seen Bridgepoint's pre-IPO pathfinder prospectus disclosing the payments before their colleagues in effect gave them the nod by buying shares in the listing. Perhaps they didn't make it to the relevant bit, page 261 of the 300-page document. There were, I'm told, no questions on the issue in investor meetings as part of the listing process. The FRC is preparing to announce which of about 200 applicants will be the first signatories to the new Stewardship Code for investors, an effort to set higher expectations around these issues and, presumably, a desirable badge for any money manager professing to be ESG-minded (all of them). When it comes to explanation, large investors should now be asked not only how they're addressing issues after the fact but why, on balance, they decided to invest in the first place. helen.thomas@ft.com 'The job of enforcing the corporate governance code specifically falls to institutional shareholders'"
46460ffeef3cf8719e32,2021-07-28,Retail investors take a shine to bespoke portfolio model,"Asset management. Personalisation BlackRock among providers tapping burgeoning demand for direct indexing products The biggest names in asset management are preparing for a shift to an era when investors demand customised equity portfolios that have traditionally been the preserve of wealthier clients. Vanguard, JPMorgan, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley have all done deals since 2020 to bolster their offerings in so-called direct indexing a more bespoke approach to off-the-shelf investment products. Fund managers expect this will mark the next stage in the democratisation of finance, and will probably put pressure on traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange traded products. By the middle of this decade, direct indexing is forecast to account for $1.5tn of assets, up from less than $500bn now, ""by taking share from other passive products such as mutual funds and ETFs"", according to a report from Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman. Direct indexing represents a ""do-ityourself arms race among wealth managers"" Neal Sheehan, analyst at Celent, wrote in a recent report. ""While the growth of ETFs will not be stopped by the rising popularity of direct indexing, wealth and asset managers will face disruption in how advisers expect products to be constructed and distributed,"" he added. Direct indexing allows investors to own a group of stocks that mimic the performance of an established index, and to customise the portfolio to manage tax losses or to include environmental, social and governance preferences. With direct indexing, ""a financial adviser via a computer can easily tailor a portfolio that mimics an index, like the S&P 500, while including specific tilts such as ESG, rebalancing between winners and losers and also reducing tax exposure,"" said Tom O'Shea, research director at Cerulli Associates. Unlike an equity mutual fund or an ETF, in a direct indexing portfolio the investor owns the securities in their account, rather than a share of a pooled fund. Software ensures the portfolio tweaks weightings to replicate the performance of the index, and to customise holdings towards investment factors such as growth and value stocks. Fund manager Parametric has dominated the sector since it created a customised separately managed account, or SMA, that behaved like an indextracker for a family office in 1992. It has since developed a direct indexing business that oversees close to $250bn across 110,000 individual SMAs. ""Direct indexing gives a freedom to capture a broad swath of the market that can then be overlaid with ESGs or factors or tax considerations,"" said Brian Langstraat, chief executive of Parametric. Other asset managers with vast mutual and exchange traded fund offerings are positioning for a future where these products could face stiff competition from custom portfolios.    As part of investment group Eaton Vance, Parametric was acquired by Morgan Stanley last year in a deal that kickstarted a flurry of activity. BlackRock bought Aperio, the second largest player in direct indexing after Parametric, in November. Vanguard made its first ever acquisition in July, buying Just Invest, a California-based wealth management boutique that provides a customisable, direct indexing service and was founded in 2016. In June, JPMorgan Asset Management acquired OpenInvest, a fintech platform that facilitates the customisation of a portfolio based on ESG metrics. This month, BlackRock also bought a minority stake in SpiderRock Advisors, an options service for SMAs. While disruption from direct indexing looms, many do not see demand for low-cost ETFs and mutual funds fading. ""The desire to personalise is real,"" said Martin Small, head of the US wealth advisory business at BlackRock. But he believes that rising demand from investors seeking advisory services will maintain growth across other products. ""Owning low-cost ETFs and basic mutual funds is the best way to grow tax deferred returns over time for most investors,"" he said. The prospect of governments implementing higher taxes on trading profits in the future particularly in the US and Europe could provide a further boost to SMAs and direct indexing. Directly owning shares in companies rather than holding those issued by an equity ETF or a mutual fund, facilitates ""tax-loss harvesting"", whereby direct indexers systematically sell losing stocks and replace them with similar holdings. That allows investors to offset capital gains taxes incurred when their investments are up, and stay in line with the index they are following. Tax loss harvesting capabilities are estimated to add 0.5 to 1 per cent of annual post-liquidation return after tax, according to Canvas, a direct indexing firm with $1.7bn in assets. ""Tax gets a lot of people in the door and then once they are on the platform they see how it becomes a one-stop shop for investors and advisers,"" said Patrick O'Shaughnessy, CEO of Canvas owner O'Shaughnessy Asset Management. ""Technology is enabling a lot of this. A broader awareness of direct indexing means that if it becomes a thing, it will be huge,"" he added. '[It] gives a freedom to capture a broad swath of the market that can then be overlaid'"
b59df95c00f514c3f279,2021-07-27,"M&A alone not a silver bullet for fund managers, says Amundi chair","Financials. Asset management Dealmaker issues warning acquisitions can never be a substitute for organic growth The chair of Amundi, who over the past decade built the group into Europe's largest asset manager, says that mergers and acquisitions are not enough to solve the challenges facing his industry and cautioned against striking deals in pursuit of scale alone. Yves Perrier, who served as chief executive of the French group from its creation in 2010 until he stepped down in May, told the Financial Times: ""Acquisitions can accelerate organic growth but they can never be a substitute for it. If you do not have skills to bring to the target ... you don't deliver synergies."" Perrier has transformed Amundi ? itself the result of a merger between the asset management companies of Crédit Agricole and Société Générale ? into a €1.76tn group through a series of savvy acquisitions and a strong run of organic growth. Its size and scope means it is often referred to as the ""BlackRock of Europe"" and analysts say that Amundi has excelled at managing costs. Notable deals have included its 2016 acquisition of Pioneer Investments from Italy's UniCredit for €3.55bn, which propelled it into the top 10 players by assets globally. The move strengthened Amundi's position in equities and included a distribution partnership with the Italian bank to sell its funds to Pioneer and UniCredit clients across Italy, Germany and Austria. ""For me, acquisitions have never been a question of scale,"" said Perrier, who was succeeded as chief executive by Valérie Baudson, his deputy. ""It's a question of reinforcing a business model. The problem for each company is to grow and to grow with profitability."" He noted that three-quarters of Amundi's growth had been organic. The group's net income of €962m last year has almost doubled since its 2015 initial public offering and its costincome ratio of 51.7 per cent make it one of the industry's most profitable players. Assets under management reached €1.76tn on March 31, up 14.9 per cent year on year. Investment managers are striking deals in pursuit of scale as they grapple with the pressures of persistently low interest rates, rising costs and downward pressure on fees. Many are seeking to increase their exposure to fast-growing markets such as passive investing, private assets and ESG strategies, as well as open up new distribution channels. But asset management M&A is fraught with execution risk: cost synergies can be offset by outflows as disconcerted clients withdraw funds and cultural clashes can destabilise teams of fund managers, resulting in departures or hurting investment performance. Perrier's tenure concluded with the €825m acquisition in April of Lyxor from Société Générale, which allowed Amundi to leapfrog German rival DWS and become the biggest player in European ETFs after BlackRock.    Angeliki Bairaktari, European asset managers analyst at Autonomous Research, said that ""Amundi is one of the very few asset managers where investors see M&A as a positive catalyst for them. The Lyxor deal seems to be logical and has low execution risk."" She added Amundi's positive record ""gives investors confidence"". Perrier acknowledged the risks as well as the advantages. ""Scale also means sometimes that you are less agile, that you create bureaucracy,"" he said, adding ""you have to try to compensate to maintain a strong entrepreneurial spirit"". He poured cold water on the idea of the star fund manager, saying that ""in Amundi there are no stars, except Amundi itself"", adding: ""Asset management of course is a people business, but it's also a business of technology."" Last year the group created Amundi Technology, which sells its proprietary software to rival asset managers and institutional investors, and is targeting €150m in revenues within five years. Under Perrier, the group focused on Europe and Asia. He said it was ""not a good idea"" for Amundi to focus on the US because it is ""dominated by the American players ... we have accepted not to be in the same kind of size as [US giants] BlackRock and Vanguard"". Instead it is among a growing number of foreign asset managers ploughing into China as the country liberalises its financial markets. Last year it gained approval for the first majority foreignowned wealth management joint venture in China, through a partnership with Bank of China that will allow it to design and manufacture products to sell to mainland investors. Some investors have cautioned western asset managers may be underestimating political risk at a time of strained relations between Washington and Beijing. But for Perrier, the risk of expanding in Asia's biggest economy is outweighed by the potential cost of missing out on the opportunity of a growing asset management market, worth an estimated $18.9tn last year. He predicts some further confrontation between the US and China but thinks the worst is over. ""It's in the interests of the Chinese to have this partnership, especially with Europeans,"" he added.

Large investors have historically been reluctant to vote against the re-election of directors at company meetings but Fidelity said that, from 2022, it would hold board members to account when companies were deemed to be making insufficient progress on diversity or in their response to global warning. ""Ultimately, boards need to be held accountable,"" said Jenn-Hui Tan, global head of stewardship and sustainable investing at Fidelity . ""It is their responsibility."" Fidelity , which oversees $787bn in client assets, said it was targeting about 1,000 companies that were large emitters of greenhouse gases at a sector level or contributed heavily to emissions within its investment portfolios. It would vote against directors where companies did not have a policy on climate change or disclose emissions with businesses in the most exposed sectors expected to have targets for reducing harmful emissions. Fidelity warned that it could vote against the re-election of directors at 300-400 companies over climate change. Fidelity also estimated that directors at a third of the 4,000 companies in which it invested faced censure over diversity issues. It said it would vote against directors in developed markets where boards were not at least 30 per cent female or 15 per cent female in markets ""where gender standards are still developing"". The asset manager already votes against all-male boards. Tan said Fidelity hoped that by speaking to boards in the months ahead, it would be able to encourage companies to take stronger action on diversity and climate change. ""We are hopeful that our policy will help companies ... to recognise the value of having diverse boards and to ensure they have the right levels of representation,"" he said. Colin Baines, investment engagement manager at Friends Provident Foundation, which has been pushing for fund houses to use their vote on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, welcomed the commitment to vote against the re-election of directors. ""We need to see formal shareholder engagement escalation policies and more forceful stewardship become the sector norm on the most pressing societal challenges and ESG risks, like avoiding dangerous levels of climate change,"" he said. Catherine Howarth, chief executive of Share Action, said: ""Voting against directors of corporate climate laggards is long overdue and we applaud asset managers for making their voting criteria crystal clear ahead of the 2022 AGM season."""
2961973eae2859495c72,2021-07-23,Leather industry could lead the way in British manufacturing,"Letters The French leather Industry came to mind when reading Sarah O'Connor's column (""Nostalgia for manufacturing won't bring better jobs for UK workers"", Opinion, July 21). When I started out some decades ago, workers in almost every tannery rushed to show you missing tops of fingers as a badge of honour. Those days have gone, and today's tanneries offer good quality employment. A feature of the leather industry is the way in which labour content increases as a hide moves from the raw to a finished shoe, glove or train seat. While modernisation has reduced labour numbers within tanneries, turning leather into handbags and saddles requires judgments that machines cannot yet manage. A year or two ago, France had 44 tanneries employing around 1,500 people but over 1,000 leather-goods makers with more than 20,000 staff and 100-plus shoemakers employing 6,000 people. This escalation in the numbers employed is what South Korea and Taiwan used to escape from poverty in the 1960s and 1970s. Adding in retail and other leather users in gloves, upholstery and garments the French leather industry believes that over 100,000 people are employed in the wider leather trade, with a turnover of €25bn, according to France's National Leather Council. Leather industry jobs do not all require high levels of education, but instead the acquisition of useful skills. Utilising leather, manufactured from the waste of the meat and dairy industry, we see the balance of design, craft and engineering for which some of our best companies are famous. The UK today has only 25 tanneries and over half our hides and nearly all sheepskins are exported or thrown away. Bringing back some production could reap big benefits. The country does still retain world-leading high-end producers of leather for most sectors. Most, but not all, end up being turned into beautiful products in workshops that offer secure, well-paid jobs outside Britain. If the UK could retain more of these jobs, there would be employment for considerable numbers of those who rightly concern O'Connor: accompanied by many of the highquality service activities in design, marketing, finance and digital retail that they require, with a domestic supply chain making all ESG issues much easier to keep transparent.

d799f9bcc0285839cf30,2021-07-23,Corporate world gets serious about sustainability,"ESG Managers are under pressure to turn good intentions into concrete action, says Kana Inagaki F or Hitachi, the appointment of its first chief environment officer in April meant closing a critical gap in its sustainability efforts. In recent years, the Japanese industrial group has undergone a radical makeover. It withdrew from its thermal power business, spent $6.4bn to buy Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB's electricity grid assets, and strengthened its global presence in railways. Hitachi's business mix has also left it better placed to seize new opportunities arising from climate change disruptions more so than at any point in the group's 111-year history. Yet Alistair Dormer whose April appointment means he now leads Hitachi's environmental initiatives as well as its mobility business says a tangible commitment by senior management to meet sustainability targets had still been missing. ""We were working on this for five years or so but it was almost being done in a corner of Tokyo,"" Dormer explains. ""We had senior-level sponsorship for sure, but who was worrying about it on a day-to-day basis and making it happen? That's my job."" Accountability is a common challenge for Japanese companies. With prime minister Yoshihide Suga pledging to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, many companies have followed suit by setting long-term targets in addition to any existing sustainability goals. Honda, for example, wants to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040. But few companies provide a detailed road map showing how they will go about achieving these ambitions. ""As a first step, it's extremely important to present a target,"" says Norichika Kanie, an expert on sustainable development at Keio University. ""The next phase is making sure that real action is being taken. It is true, though, that more companies are now aware that efforts in sustainability lead to actual business success."" At Hitachi, Dormer has led efforts to introduce a remuneration scheme for heads of business units that will tie annual bonus payments to hitting carbon emission targets. He also persuaded chief executive Toshiaki Higashihara to sponsor the COP26 climate change summit in the UK later this year. ""We need to be creative in how seriously executives engage with targets that are far into the future,"" says Keiji Kojima, Hitachi's newly appointed president. ""It's hard to take it forward when you're thinking that you can leave it to the next generation. That's why we made sure that everyone does their job thinking about the environment on a day-to-day basis."" While measures to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics in annual executive pay are widespread in the US and Europe, Japanese companies are only now starting to introduce them. Entertainment group Sony and cosmetics business Shiseido are among those taking a lead.    A survey conducted by consultancy Willis Towers Watson last year suggested that 15 per cent of Japan's top 100 companies by market capitalisation had such schemes in place. However, analysts estimate that the proportion is less than 5 per cent for the 2,000 or so companies listed within the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section. That compares with 52 per cent of S&P 500 companies and 63 per cent of companies listed on the main European indices, according to the Willis Towers Watson research. Meanwhile, initiatives to link ESG to long-term incentives are far less common, both in Japan and elsewhere. Takaaki Kushige, a senior director at Willis Towers Watson, says one reason for Japan's tardiness in linking ESG to executive pay is that many businesses have governance structures that are not sophisticated enough. This, in turn, means they lack the kind of independent remuneration committees that can fairly assess ESG metrics, which are more complex than stock price and other financial indicators. Still, companies are increasingly keen to ensure that senior managers hit sustainability targets, as investments to cut carbon emissions become critically important in sectors that were built around fossil fuels. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, for example, is seeking to reinvent itself in clean energy as it tries to shift away from businesses such as coal power stations and shipbuilding. One key technology it is investing in is carbon capture, which was recently chosen by Drax, the FTSE 250 power company, for use at its main site in northern England to achieve ""negative emissions"". ""The market [for carbon capture] does not exist yet, but if we wait for the market to be built, we won't be able to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050,"" says Makoto Susaki, head of MHI's carbon capture, utilisation and storage business task force. ""It's very tough for us [financially] in the near term but we have to continue these efforts towards 2050."" Even as companies scramble to raise their environmental game, pressure is growing to address other ESG concerns. Executives say the challenge is even greater with social issues such as labour practices. Already, the supply chains of businesses ranging from Fast Retailing, owner of Uniqlo, to electronics group Panasonic have come under scrutiny. Joji Tagawa, Nissan's chief sustainability officer, says that, since his appointment in 2019, the carmaker's management has strengthened its focus on human rights, alongside efforts to reduce carbon emissions and maximise recycling. Last month, Nissan released global guidelines on human rights, which emphasised its opposition to forced and child labour and promised protection to whistleblowers. In recent years, campaigners have highlighted the dependence of electric vehicle makers such as Nissan on cobalt, some of which is mined in exploitative conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""The focus on human rights and sustainability has been increasing more than regular companies had anticipated,"" Tagawa says. ""We are not perfect but we are working on it extensively."" 'It's tough for us in the near term but we have to continue these efforts towards 2050'"
4918cf228574da4c7348,2021-07-23,Pension boss sounds caution on ESG focus,"Eiji Hirano tells Leo Lewis that returns are the key aim of $1.7tn government fund Pension boss sounds caution on ESG focus The ex-chair of the board of the world's largest pension fund, who oversaw its $1.7tn portfolio as it became a pioneer of responsible investment, has warned the institution to remember its core duty to Japanese pensioners: returns. ""The GPIF [Government Pension Investment Fund] must always go back to its investment purpose,"" says Eiji Hirano, who stood down from the job three months ago. His comments reflect concerns that too great a focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards can add risk, including a possible collision between the law and the investment philosophy under the GPIF's previous regime. According to the law under which the GPIF operates, it must invest with the sole purpose of benefiting Japanese citizens through the returns generated. And Hirano says GPIF is well aware of that obligation emphasising that he does not think it has strayed from that principle since he left. But he adds: ""There is always a potential danger that GPIF money is misused,"" stressing that the fund's board should now be especially determined to act as a guardian against that. Though carefully framed, Hirano's comments highlight increasingly urgent questions over the future direction of the GPIF since the departure in March 2020 of its charismatic chief investment officer Hiromichi Mizuno. He was replaced by the more reclusive and media-shy Eiji Ueda, a former Goldman Sachs bond trader. During Mizuno's five-year tenure, he sought to turn the once sleepy-looking GPIF into a global symbol of more modern Japanese thinking. His time there roughly coincided with the arrival of Japan's stewardship and governance codes. These new guidelines were designed not only to precipitate practical changes in corporate Japan, but also to reinforce the idea that the country's equity market was tackling some of the problems that had tarnished its reputation among both foreign and domestic investors. Despite strict constraints on how the fund can operate for example, it is unable to hold individual stocks and therefore cannot directly vote on companies' policies Mizuno was able to use the GPIF's choice of external fund Continued on page 2 Continued from page 1 managers to project a tough stance on governance shortcomings at Japanese companies. While this was happening, the GPIF pressed ahead with a historic and still internally controversial rebalancing away from government debt and towards stocks. It now splits its investment roughly equally between domestic and foreign bonds and domestic and foreign equities. These weightings will be revised again in 2025, and there is already speculation that the fund's exposure to domestic Japanese equities may be reduced then. But arguably Mizuno's boldest achievement, which he proselytised about at Davos and other global financial forums, was yoking the GPIF name to the then fledgling theme of ESG investing. The campaign included what Mizuno himself described as the ""epochal"" decision to mandate indexcompilers FTSE and MSCI to create ESG    indices for the GPIF. It sent the message that the GPIF under his stewardship would regard ESG factors as financially relevant. That, says Hirano, is one key area where debate is now focused. While there is increasing evidence that some aspects of ESG-themed strategies boost returns in the long term, he thinks many ESG proponents, including Mizuno, rely on the argument that it is ""common sense"" that this will be the case across the board. But not all agree that the non-financial outcomes being pushed via ESG investment translate directly into the financial outcomes the GPIF is legally obliged to prioritise. A significant clash came in late 2019 when Mizuno announced that the GPIF would stop lending its global equity stocks to short sellers who bet on share price falls. Although the move was controversial, prompting fierce debate within the fund because of the forgone revenues, Mizuno who last year joined the board of Tesla, the carmaker led by outspoken anti-shorter Elon Musk argued that the practice was antithetical to ESG principles. ""I never met a short seller who has a long-term perspective,"" Mizuno told the Financial Times then, adding that he felt comfortable with the decision because it represented a choice between making cash immediately or being ""better stewards for our constituency"". Mizuno is also proud of adding two new concepts to the lexicon of ESG fund management: universal ownership and the cross-generational investor. He explained to reporters earlier this year that the GPIF is so big that it essentially owns the whole investable 'universe', which means its focus should be ""making the whole market better"" rather than attempting the mathematically difficult feat of beating the market. As for the cross-generational investor, Mizuno said the idea is necessary to emphasise the long-term nature of ESG strategies. Hirano, however, sounds a cautious note in his conversation with the FT. While agreeing that it is important to correct the market bias towards shorttermism, he points to several outstanding concerns about the ESG narrative. These include the lack of a common evaluation system and a tendency to stress the environmental over the governance part of ESG. He also admits to feeling uneasy about the large number of chief executives who emphasise the importance of ESG principles or the UN's sustainable development goals. The focus may be right, he says, but delivery depends on the still unproven determination and perseverance of all those leaders.

bb62e039a6f777499699,2021-07-23,Sony boss sees purpose as crucial to future prosperity,"ESGKenichiro Yoshida wants sustainability to shape all of the entertainment group's decisions, says Kana Inagaki When the Covid pandemic forced many of his employees to work from home, Sony chief executive Kenichiro Yoshida took every opportunity to speak about the company's stated ""purpose"". Created in early 2019, this 12-word statement ""fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology"" was repeated like a mantra via blog posts, Zoom calls and investor presentations. ""Our purpose is the basis of how Sony engages with society,"" he said during a government seminar in March. ""It is also what drives each of our employees."" For companies struggling with pandemic disruptions, talk of sustainability initiatives and purpose may feel like luxuries when the priority is to rebuild their business. However, for some chief executives, last year's events the pandemic, the Black Lives Matter protests and a string of natural disasters have prompted a rethink of employee wellbeing and their companies' social role. In April 2020, Sony announced the rollout of a $100m fund to support those affected by Covid-19. Two months later, Sony Music launched another fund of the same size to support social justice and anti-racist initiatives. While some executives questioned spending money at a time of crisis, rank-and-file employees welcomed the initiatives. But when Yoshida took the helm of the Japanese entertainment group in April 2018, few associated the quiet but straight-talking former finance chief with a passion for climate change and sustainability. He won respect from shareholders by helping to end Sony's long period of losses, selling off weaker businesses, and breaking down the silos that had divided its lucrative entertainment segments, ranging from games to music, films and animation. As the company's financial performance steadied and its shares hit a twodecade high, however, Yoshida turned his focus to the question of purpose. In an early sign of his priorities, Yoshida wrote an internal blog post titled ""Sony as part of the Earth"" a day after he took over as CEO. ""Companies such as Sony are able to carry out their economic activities because of a healthy global environment,"" he wrote. ""Let's think together how Sony can make ESG [environmental, social and governance] contributions through our growth."" Within nine months, the company's purpose statement and a set of corporate values had been created. ""There was a period when we struggled operationally but, after Yoshida became CEO, we entered a phase of thinking about how the company can achieve long-term, sustainable growth,"" explains Shiro Kambe, Sony's sustainability officer. Takashi Nawa, visiting professor at Hitotsubashi University Business School, says Japanese companies' sustainability efforts are often confined to simply improving their environmental performance. It is still unusual for them to identify areas of their business where they can both lead the market and promote sustainability.    ""Companies must obviously meet environmental standards but the ones like Sony are trying to set a sustainability agenda that will link to their true competitiveness,"" Nawa says. Sony's green ambitions actually predate Yoshida's tenure as CEO. In 2010, the group set out its ambition to achieve a ""zero environmental footprint"" by 2050 and has since announced fiveyear action plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the use of plastic. To strengthen accountability, executive pay is now linked with ESG metrics. Sony is also one of the eight founding members of the Responsible Business Alliance, an international consortium of businesses committed to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains. But pressure to move faster on sustainability continues to grow. In July 2020, technology giant Apple, Sony's biggest client in image sensors, called on its manufacturing partners to switch to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030. While Sony's sites in Europe and China already run entirely on renewables, its biggest challenge is in its home country, where most of its image sensor manufacturing is based and electricity generation is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. The largest part of Sony's carbon footprint, however, comes not from its factories but from its products and services when they are in use by customers. In its 2019-20 fiscal year, annual energy consumption per product was 52 per cent lower than in 2013-14, but executives say more technological innovation is needed to make further reductions. While Sony's engineers were urged to cut costs during the lossmaking era, Kimio Maki, head of the group's electronics and medical businesses, says the mindset on spending has changed. Managers now recognise that the short-term costs incurred in creating environmentally friendly products can translate into longer-term value, as consumers worry more about sustainability. To take one example, Sony last month began selling noise-cancelling earbuds that are packaged in a material made from bamboo and sugarcane fibre. ""Creating products that are friendly to the environment is an added value and that requires a cost,"" Maki says. ""But products that do not take the environment into consideration will be ignored by the customers we are targeting."""
3aef0ce7d695892f5d02,2021-07-22,BHP weighs sale of oil and gas assets in push towards low-carbon economy,"Commodities BHP is examining options for its oil and gas assets including a sale, as the miner looks to focus on commodities that will be needed in the shift to a low-carbon economy, according to people familiar with the matter. The decision to review the future of the petroleum business comes as big miners face pressure to reduce their exposure to fossil fuels and align with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. BHP's petroleum unit sets the company apart from its mining peers. But ageing fields and the sale of its lossmaking US shale business in 2018 have led to a sharp fall in production from 235m barrels in 2013 to around 103m in the year to June, or 280,000 barrels per day. While BHP has options to increase output at the Scarborough gasfield off Australia as well as in the Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago, that would require investment. Mike Henry, BHP chief executive, has spoken positively of the outlook for oil and gas, arguing that the medium-term outlook for prices is attractive because of a lack of investment in the industry. But with investors increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance issues, Tyler Broda, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said he could see why BHP might contemplate an exit. ""A potential sale is consistent with ... Mike Henry's previous commentary about expectations for an oil price recovery to open up options for the group's petroleum business,"" he said. Dominic O'Kane, analyst at JPMorgan, said a petroleum exit could be a ""powerthe ful corporate catalyst"" that would ""enhance"" BHP's ESG credentials. ""We believe an exit would likely ringfence BHP's exceptional cash flows for nonfossil fuel organic growth, mergers and acquisitions and generous shareholder distributions since BHP could avoid a major new capital investment phase this decade in petroleum,"" he said. In the six months to December, the petroleum business generated revenue of almost $1.6bn. Analysts at Bernstein Research said the unit could be worth $13bn. BHP declined to comment. Since taking the helm in 2000, Henry has spoken of increasing the company's options in ""future-facing"" commodities including copper and nickel. But large, high-grade deposits are becoming more difficult to find and most of the world's big miners are also looking for opportunities in those commodities. BHP already sees potash, a key crop nutrient, as a long-term replacement for oil and gas and another leg to its business alongside iron ore, copper and coking coal. The company is expected to approve the $5.7bn first stage of Jansen, a giant Canadian potash project, when it reports annual results next month."
fb1e6dc1c1abe62cfc3a,2021-07-21,Private equity cannot ignore its ESG obligations,"Letters Patrick Jenkins (""Private equity pushes back against the growing demands of ESG"", Inside Business, July 20) is right to identify listed governance requirements as one factor that makes private equity attractive. But that simply reflects the different ownership structures. As London seeks to be the gold standard for listed global corporations, it should be no surprise that businesses with a small number of shareholders conclude that the listed governance rules are not proportionate for them. There is nothing wrong with that where it is easy to communicate with your owners. Many a senior executive has commented that on boards of public companies, 80 per cent of the discussion is on governance and 20 per cent on strategy. The reverse is true for private equity-owned companies. But he is wrong to suggest that this construct allows PE-controlled businesses to duck their environmental, social and governance responsibilities. The PE model requires an ultimate sale to a likely listed strategic buyer or an IPO. Quite apart from doing what is right, the incentive is certainly in place to ensure that ESG, in all its guises, has been adequately addressed in order to maximise the exit value.

0ff3411470008d829f97,2021-07-21,Diversity drive Investors push equality issues up the agenda,"Shareholder pressure on companies including Amazon, Union Pacific and JPMorgan Chase to address race and other diversity issues has risen to record levels this year, after the Black Lives Matter movement and the pandemic focused investor attention on social challenges. Investor support for resolutions at annual meetings that focused on diversity, such as calling for companies to report on their workforce inclusion efforts, has soared, according to figures from Proxy Insight, a data provider. The average of investor support for diversity-related resolutions globally in the first six months of 2021 was 42.4 per cent, compared with 23.9 per cent for the whole of 2020, the data showed. Several such resolutions received majority support from shareholders, including proposals calling for American Express and Union Pacific to report annually on diversity efforts. Heidi Soumerai, senior environmental, social and governance adviser at Boston Trust Walden, a US asset manager, said the ""extraordinary events"" of the past two years had been a ""main impetus for investor and corporate attention on the 'S' in ESG, especially racial justice issues"". ""In numerous ways, the times have exposed devastating, disproportionate impacts on people of colour, including economic and health impacts,"" she added. Following the murder of George Floyd last year and the Black Lives Matter protests, several big asset management bosses, including Larry Fink at BlackRock, spoke about the need to address racial injustice. BlackRock, BNP Paribas Asset Management and Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) were among asset managers that supported at least some diversity-focused resolutions this year, with BlackRock voting in favour at companies including Berkshire Hathaway, Union Pacific and Charter Communications. LGIM supported 21 proposals from shareholders focused on diversity in the US, including at Amazon. Adam Kanzer, head of stewardship for the Americas for BNP Paribas Asset Management, said it had been a ""historic proxy season"". ""Events of the past year have underscored a number of critical faultlines in the US that must be repaired, and these resolutions are part of that effort. Investors are seeking to identify the corporate sector's role in addressing various forms of discrimination,"" he added. Soumerai suggested the high levels of ""for"" votes at annual meetings ""indicate that many large asset managers and asset owners are backing up their words in support of racial justice through their voting practices"". At Amazon's shareholder meeting in May, 44 per cent of investors backed a proposal calling for a racial equity audit at the company. Despite the strong showing, Vanguard, which is the company's largest shareholder after founder Jeff Bezos, said it did not support the proposal. However, Vanguard voted for a diversity proposal at American Express.    The great majority of diversityfocused resolutions this year were filed at US companies, with a small number in Canada and one in South Korea, according to Proxy Insight. Diversity proponents have also compelled companies to disclose diversity statistics without a shareholder vote. For example, McDonald's and drugstore chain CVS ""made really significant increases to their data disclosure"" this year, prompting investors to withdraw shareholder petitions, said Meredith Benton, founder of Whistle Stop Capital, which consults investors on corporate governance. Investors were most successful in demanding companies publish basic information about their workforces statistics on race, ethnicity and gender they already provide to the US government but are not made public. Scott Stringer, New York City comptroller, last year started a campaign that has led more than half of S&P 100 companies to disclose this information. Benton said the next step was to get companies to disclose diversity information about their recruiting, retention and promotions. Attracta Mooney in London and Patrick Temple- West in New York"
7ca4e61fb66cb602ee1a,2021-07-20,Private equity pushes back against the growing demands of ESG,"C all it Newton's law of corporate ownership. As listed companies come under increasing investor pressure to act on everything from executive pay to carbon emissions, a reaction against those constraints seems to be fuelling a spate of buyouts by private equity firms. The first half of 2021 was a boom period for the sector with $500bn-plus of deals, the highest level since records began four decades ago. The core reasons are well rehearsed: a glut of cash in buyout firms' coffers; ultra-low interest rates that make borrowing easier than ever and opportunities thrown up by digital innovation. There have even been pockets of perceived cheapness in otherwise exuberant public markets, with the relatively undervalued post-Brexit UK a particular buyout hotspot. Done well, private equity has a crucial role to play in modernising economies, helping companies to restructure efficiently away from the short-termist glare of public markets. Buyout firms rightly pounce on listed companies that they deem undervalued or bloated. In so doing, they keep capitalism efficient and act as a positive reactionary force. But is private equity also reactionary in the conservative backlash sense of the word facilitating a rebellion against some of the progressive constraints of public company existence, particularly the growing demands of complying with standards on environmental, social and governance issues? The evidence is mounting. More freedom on governance has long been seen as a plus for private companies. As listed company governance has become stricter, so the advantage of private company status has increased. Heads at private equity owned companies relish diminished bureaucracy and the ability to earn more money without critical scrutiny from public company shareholders. Fortress's agreed £9.5bn buyout of Morrisons this month came with a strong hint that management ""incentives structures"" would be boosted, only weeks after the listed UK supermarket suffered a shareholder revolt over pay. It is in the field that a of the industry. its most reactionary The latitude on governance shown to companies that are privately owned extends to the private equity firms themselves. In particular, it is a notoriously male-dominated industry. Social issues, S of ESG, are also antithetical to much traditional private equity. Many listed companies increasingly trumpet ""stakeholder value"", expressing concern for staff, customers and a company's local area. Private equity remains a safe space for the hard-nosed. Quite rightly in some instances: public company management may have been loath to take tough decisions on closing shops, factories or offices, and making job cuts. But it is in the environmental field that a good chunk of the private equity industry is playing its most obviously reactionary role. When oil majors are looking to sell off stranded production assets, private equity are among the readiest bidders. Some private equity insiders insist that the sector is not as unreconstructed as such deals might suggest. They point to examples of buyout investors providing the impetus for radical change: Goldman Sachs' buyout arm backed the wind farm strategy of Orsted as it moved away from oil and gas. A recent analysis by consultancy    Bain admitted there was ""scepticism"" about ESG investing in the private equity industry. But it trumpeted notable triumphs, such as the overhaul of Polish convenience store chain Zabka, owned by CVC, which led to substantial cuts in plastic waste and CO2 emissions, and a boost in plantbased food sales. The fact remains, though, that ESG is a fringe topic in the private equity industry. That in turn risks undermining the whole drive to embed ESG in global business. First, the steady switch towards private ownership and away from public markets neutralises progress made in public company ESG standards. Second, private equity is under little pressure to change. Buyout firms claim that their ""limited partner"" end investors, such as right-thinking pension funds and endowments, are demanding more focus on ESG. However, those LPs have little genuine influence, given the wall of return-hungry money clamouring for access to the best private equity funds. The ESG drive among listed companies may well continue to spur reactionary instincts in the private company domain at least until ESG criteria can generate superior investment returns. For now, at least, that remains unproven. patrick.jenkins@ft.com It is in the environmental field that a good chunk of the industry is playing its most obviously reactionary role"
2470c336afc52e52274e,2021-07-20,Zegna: suitable case,"Twitter: @FTLex The Italian luxury business is going public through a deal with a blank cheque company. The valuation, as a share of forecast operating profits, is lower than most quoted peers, as are its operating profit margins. It also stands out for its high proportion of sales in greater China. Office traditions have faded fast. Even before the pandemic, formal attire was falling out of favour. Today, just getting workers back to the office is a struggle, never mind switching back from casual wear. All this has put pressure on Zegna, the familyowned Italian company renowned for men's suits. A need for reinvention underpins its decision to end more than 100 years of private ownership. The menswear company plans to merge with a US blank cheque company launched by European private equity group Investindustrial and chaired by former UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti. Not that the family will lose control. Despite the sale, the Zegnas will keep their grip on 62 per cent of the new group. The deal gives the group an enterprise value of $3.2bn. Compared with its expected 2022 earnings before interest and tax, that puts it on a multiple of 18. Though similar to Burberry and Kering, it will remain about half of Italian peers such as Prada. That makes sense, given diminishing demand for suits. Yet the business looks financially sound, with some eyecatching traits that should appeal to ESG investors. A vertically integrated supply chain from sheep to store should insulate it from the supply chain controversies that dog the sector. Accessories such as shoes, bags and eyewear earn higher margins. But these account for just a tenth of Zegna's sales, well below many competitors. It has high hopes for its luxury leisurewear sales. Expanding geographically is an option, though there is not much scope in the powerhouse market of China, where Zegna opened its first store in 1991. The Greater China region accounts for more than half its sales, well above the sector average. Its €500m acquisition of US luxury label Thom Browne cemented its popularity with Asian shoppers. Going public will provide Zegna with almost $250m to snap up other brands. It will remain a relatively small house, a disadvantage when it comes to ecommerce. Scale has driven the consolidation sweeping the sector. Presumably, once listed, the Zegna family and Investindustrial will not accept a casual attitude to the growth strategy."
70eab1306586005b9390,2021-07-20,When corporate purpose goes up in smoke,"Philip Morris International likes to talk about purpose. The company's ""statement of purpose"" on its website runs to 2,000 words, covering the tobacco company's appreciation of the toxicity of its key product, and its efforts towards ""a smoke-free future"". And it has gone further than most big tobacco peers. Revenues from ""reduced-risk"" products have grown from next to nothing to about a quarter of the business in the past five years. But when your purpose guides you on to a path that many onlookers rank somewhere between bizarre and totally unacceptable, something has gone rather wrong. That's where the com- pany finds itself with its £1bn deal to buy UK inhaler business Vectura. The idea of one of the biggest tobacco companies owning a specialist pharma business has prompted a furious backlash from health campaigners. The UK has asked officials to monitor the deal, although intervention is unlikely. PMI's reaction smacks of a company too used to being on the defensive. It initially dismissed suggestions the deal could encounter opposition. Whatever the company does, its executive chair André Calantzopoulos said, people ""try to find the negative rather than the positive"". He has spoken of an ""obsessive focus"" on Big Tobacco. But you don't have to subscribe to a malignant caricature of cigarette companies to see the issues ? and to think Vectura's board should have thought more about whether they were recommending a good buyer to shareholders, as well as a good price. PMI has set itself a goal of producing half its revenues from non-combustible products, like its heated tobacco, by 2025. Health campaigners don't like that, given the continued risks and the notion of selling a fix to a problem you created. But the company argues it has the expertise to make products that smokers will actually use, vastly improving health outcomes. Vectura is clearly different. To borrow from another industry experiencing existential angst, it is like BP not only pursuing wind and solar power in the transition away from fossil fuels, but getting into flood prevention and forest fire management in the meantime. True, PMI sees opportunities to use inhaler technology to deliver cardiovascular or pain management drugs, or indeed other consumer products. But Vectura currently makes the bulk of its £200m in revenues in smoking-related diseases. It is focusing more on contract development work for other companies and won most contracts last year in respiratory disease and lung cancer. Vectura will run autonomously, says PMI, which reports results today. It could counter criticism by separating or selling parts of the business related to smoking-related illnesses but has no plans to do. For a start, Vectura will count towards a target launched in February to make $1bn in revenues ""beyond nicotine"" by 2025 (although treating smoking-related illnesses is less far from the core business than you'd hope). In that context, Vectura looks like one option on a long-term business strategy from a $155bn company also pursuing treatment and wellness.    Other tobacco companies have taken a portfolio approach to their future, like British American Tobacco which uses Btomorrow Ventures to bet on every- thing from drinks to transcranical stimulation devices (no, me neither). Another danger is that tobacco ownership impedes Vectura's ability to attract talent, win business and develop products. The line between the pharma and tobacco sectors isn't as crisp as you might assume: Japan Tobacco has a pretty small pharma division which dates back to the 1980s; GSK works with a company called Medicago, which counts one PMI as a major shareholder. But given PMI's intention to partner with molecule-owners on inhaled therapies it needs to be able to win business in an ESG-focused world. That the European Respiratory Society, a large scientific organisation, specifies that its activities are not open to those with links ""real or perceived, direct or indirect"" with tobacco illustrates the problem. For a company so keen on purpose, PMI seems to have confused its own and endangered that of its target. helen.thomas@ft.com The idea of one of the biggest tobacco companies owning a pharma business has prompted a backlash"
878ae5b9c2b32dce843a,2021-07-19,Specialist engineers have right tools for growth,"Industrial goods. Soaring valuations Niche manufacturers perform better than generalist rivals but China looms as a threat In a spa town in the Cotswolds lies Spirax Sarco. The engineer makes the special pumps and tubes essential to Covid-19 vaccine production, the steam systems that cook Heinz's baked beans and the electric thermal heaters to safely launch Nasa's spacecraft. But its profile barely reaches beyond its customers, despite its near £11bn value. ""Although we're a FTSE 100, we're not a household name because we operate in very specific niches,"" said Nick Anderson, chief executive. Spirax Sarco is one of a handful of sophisticated engineers focused on hidden corners of modern industry whose valuations surged before and during the pandemic. Many have eclipsed more generalised and cyclical London-listed manufacturers, such as IMI, Weir Group and Smiths Group, whose valuation has been dragged down by the medical division it has been struggling to separate and sell since 2018. Shares in Spirax Sarco have risen 74 per cent from pre-pandemic levels, even after more than tripling over the previous five years. Its peers ? Halma, Spectris and Renishaw ? have followed a similar pattern and the trend stretches beyond the UK. Valuations of specialist industrial groups including Swiss actuator producer Belimo, Japanese sensor maker Keyence and Ohio-based lab equipment manufacturer Mettler-Toledo, have risen far above those of more broadbased conglomerate rivals. Bankers are now pointing to an unprecedented divide between these specialist companies and the more commoditised companies struggling to con- sistently increase profits, partly due to margin pressure from greater competition in low-cost regions such as China. ""The premium that used to be 10 or 20 per cent is at 50 per cent or more between the high-quality folks and average ones in industrial tech. We're talking about two very different worlds,"" said one industrial banker. One factor behind the allure of niche UK groups to investors is that their highly specialised products are used in industrial processes in the pandemic's most buoyant markets, such as pharmaceuticals and food and beverage. With customers seeing their products as essential, they have been less vulnerable to cost-cutting. Anthony Plom, analyst at Berenberg, said investors sought resilient high-tech engineers during the pandemic's ""services downturn"" adding: ""They've almost been treated like quasi-cash over the past 12 months as they won't let you down."" Julian Fosh, fund manager at Liontrust Asset Management, a large investor in specialist UK manufacturers, said the companies were adept at reinvesting profits and ensuring high cash returns on invested capital ? a measure of their efficiency at generating profits. ""We buy and hold. It's better to have a quality business and pay a better price for it,"" said Fosh.    Other manufacturers have been more exposed in the pandemic. Operating profits at heat treatment supplier Bodycote, for example, were almost wiped out last year because of its high exposure to the automotive and aerospace sectors. Vesuvius, a molten metal flow engineer, was hit by the downturn in steel production. Fears have been rising, however, that the successful specialist companies are starting to look overvalued. Equipment maker Renishaw failed to find a buyer after a recent search, as its value rose from £3bn before the pandemic to as high as £5bn. The average ratio between enterprise value and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation has hit about 33 times at Spirax Sarco, Halma, Spectris, Renishaw and Rotork. A basket of 11 other London-listed engineers trade at 15 times, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Investors and analysts dismiss the notion of a bubble, defending the specialist engineers' premium as justified given the expectation of profit upgrades following this year's rebound in industrial production. Andrew Williams, chief executive of Halma, an Amersham-based company that manages 45 health and safety businesses, said the group was operating in ""markets with long-term structural growth drivers"". The £10.4bn-valued group has doubled its earnings in five years and increased its dividend by 5 per cent or more for 42 years by buying up smaller companies, often privately held, and expanding them. ""We have a 20-year mindset when it comes to an acquisition ... The value we bring is maturing that business into a global company,"" said Williams. Scott Cagehin, an analyst at Investec, said while some makers such as Spectris were venturing into software, groups such as Spirax Sarco and Halma that help customers reduce water and energy use are also becoming attractive as ""ESG plays"" for investors. Exposure to oil and gas has weighed others down, such as actuator specialist Rotork. However, the market looks set to become tougher, with Beijing's intention to develop 10,000 ""little giants"" in niche manufacturing sectors, increasing the pressure on UK specialist groups, which derive the majority of their revenues from overseas.

3c3d24771cd83d47972d,2021-07-17,Activist delivers a refreshing remedy for ESG hot air,"The Top Line Tom Braithwaite PwC made a splashy announcement last month. The accountancy firm said it would invest $12bn and hire 100,000 staff to help companies ""create a virtuous circle between earning trust and delivering sustained outcomes"". That hiring spree is bigger than the total workforce at Caterpillar, Shell or Procter & Gamble. It is part of a strategy called The New Equation. And that equation is: $12bn + ESG blather = $$$$$. Fittingly for environmental, social and governance initiatives, which are riven with empty rhetoric and fuzzy targets, PwC is vague on where the money and personnel will be deployed. Although the whole project is infused with ESG language, some of the hires will be doing traditional jobs such as auditing rather than advising companies on their ESG strategies. But that is no reason to be sceptical of the business opportunity. Such is the corporate desperation to be seen to be making progress on ESG that the new equation is certain to be a successful formula. The whole ESG complex is cranking up into high gear ahead of November's COP26 climate summit. The last holdouts are crumbling. One of the few companies to resist was ExxonMobil. Other oil majors would talk about clean energy transitions and reducing carbon emissions. Exxon had a different vision. The world's population and wealth were growing, the company said. Those people needed and could afford more energy. Therefore, Exxon would deliver more oil and gas. Should it not move, like BP, to clean electricity? Why would we? said Exxon. We have no expertise there. Should it commit to going net zero? How can we? said Exxon. We can make our business cleaner but not that clean. You can worry about the future of the planet while still admiring the honesty of that stance, which contrasts favourably with the empty ecomarketing patter from other dirty companies. But now it has been derailed. That is thanks to one of the most extraordinary activist campaigns ever waged. In December, Engine No 1, a new activist fund set up by investors Chris James and Charlie Penner, attacked Exxon's strategy and proposed adding four new directors to change course. It was an unlikely crusade. It is rare for a $200bn company with Exxon's prestige and battery of defences to have directors foisted on the board. But that is what happened. Engine's slick campaign won over long-suffering institutions fed up with the company's underperformance. Last month three of its four nominees were elected by shareholders. By forcing Exxon to re-examine its strategy of expensive investment in new oil and gas development, the activists are likely to have more real impact on the company's environmental footprint than any army of ESG marketeers.    Any remaining faith in Exxon's honesty disintegrated. It wrongly said of the highly qualified nominees that ""none of the Engine director candidates meet the standards or needs"" of the board. Appealing to shareholders' wallets, it misrepresented the Engine manifesto as a plan that would ""endanger the cash flows needed to support the dividend and invest for the future"". In fact, since the activists showed up, Exxon's share price has soared on the belief that management might be forced to stop wasteful spending and the company's weak finances would be improved. The new directors all have high levels of industry experience and can challenge entrenched thinking. That does not mean Exxon needs to copy BP and reinvent itself as a clean energy company. But it should at least mean cutting back expansion where the financial returns are highly uncertain, mitigating the environmental damage along the way. The risk of this stunning outcome is that companies spend even more money on ESG consultants at PwC. The hope is that Engine and like-minded activists can see through the guff and take action at other targets where capitalism and a cleaner world go hand in hand. tom.braithwaite@ft.com The risk of this stunning outcome at Exxon is that businesses spend even more on consultants at PwC"
576272640cfdbdb192ec,2021-07-17,Silver linings for women investors,"""How's your pandemic been?"" As we emerge from lockdowns, this is a question we're likely to hear a lot more often. The answer will no doubt vary from ""hard"" to ""hell"". No one has been spared the impact of Covid-19, be it physical, mental or financial. For me, it hasn't been that bad. Don't get me wrong. Being locked down with a four-yearold and two-year old, 24 hours a day, was relentless. But I've managed because unlike many others I've had a lot of support. My husband, placed on furlough, shared the household chores and childcare, while my employer embraced new ways of working (even delivering my old office chair to my front door) and demonstrating tolerance when I or any of my colleagues needed to soothe a howling toddler or deal with a stroppy teenager. The real godsend was my 24-year-old stepdaughter, who arrived two years ago from Australia on a much-anticipated gap year. She helped with everything from watering the new vegetable patch to home schooling though her dreams of travel, music festivals and making new friends were sadly extinguished. The pandemic came with a price for everyone, notably the young and ethnic minority groups. But it is well established that women paid a particularly high price. Many lost or quit their jobs, with Covid-19 crystallising the so-called ""motherhood penalty"", the opportunity cost that having a baby has on your pay and prospects. It also underlined the ""good daughter"" penalty the fact that daughters are still far more likely than sons to care for a sick or elderly relative. The past 15 months have seen women giving up work, working less or losing productivity. Research shows men have been promoted at three times the rate of women. Women tend to dominate employment in the servicebased sector. This sector is typically less volatile during recessions or downturns but Covid-19 turned ""typical"" on its head, which brings me back to my stepdaughter. As a trained hairdresser, she found a job at a local hair salon soon after arriving in the UK. Hair salons tend to be recessionproof even if the economy is wobbling, people still need haircuts. But this time, no one was having a haircut. My stepdaughter, along with many other women in the sector, was placed on furlough. Women are more likely to work in industries requiring face-to-face interaction retail, hospitality, travel, airlines, self-care and education. From receptionists to air hostesses, it's work that cannot be done from home. Now consider the fact that the UK is a service-based economy, with 80 per cent of its output coming from this sector. It is not just a UK issue. In the latest global women and money report, Fidelity International looked at the experiences and views of women internationally, across six markets in the UK, Europe and Asia. It found 31 per cent of women had seen a drop in their ability to save in the past 12 months, compared with 26 per cent of men. The fallout will reverberate long into the future. If anything, the pandemic has taught us to plan for uncertainty, and our personal finances are a good starting point. But it's also taught us that uncertainty cannot be allowed to jeopardise equality.    The Fidelity report also posed the question ""Are you an investor?"" and found that only a third (33 per cent) of women see themselves as one. The sense that investment was a man's terrain was true in every surveyed market bar China, where 60 per cent of women see themselves as investors slightly more than the 58 per cent of men. Beyond the lessons in opportunity, education and equality, there's an investment takeaway in all of this and it lies in the ""S"" of ESG. The social side of environmental, social and governance investing is the hardest to define and quantify, but in a post-Covid world, it is increasingly important. Companies are under mounting pressure to take greater accountability not only for the welfare of their workforce, but for the community at large, and for the individuals in their often complex supply chains. Issues range from how companies approach redundancy (think JD Wetherspoon and British Airways) to race and inclusion (Black Lives Matter) and gender parity in the workforce, from closing the pay gap to promoting more women to senior levels. As well as better run companies and more sustainable investments, there is another silver lining for women in spite of the devastating aftermath of the virus. The pandemic has made remote working normal. The concept is well and truly road tested. That's good news for women, who tend to choose jobs that fit around their children, or elderly relatives, with more manageable hours and shorter commutes. This should mean women no longer face those societal penalties. The other good news is that after months of home schooling her four-year-old sister, my stepdaughter has found her true vocation. She's returning to Australia and will be studying to become a teacher. Maike Currie is an investment director at Fidelity International. The views expressed are personal.

596ce58cedaa2367bf7c,2021-07-16,ETFs on track for record year after inflows reach $659bn,"Equities. Bullish outlook Model portfolios and ESG lead charge amid strong rebound in asset prices from pandemic low Investors are pouring money into exchange traded funds at a historic pace as equity and corporate bond markets rally to new peaks and asset managers increasingly turn to the vehicles to build portfolios. Flows into ETFs are already on track to outpace a record 2020, totalling $659bn in the first six months of 2021 compared with $767bn for all of last year, according to ETFGI. Global equity-based ETFs have already eclipsed last year's intake, attracting net flows of $459bn as of June 30, exceeding $366bn and $283bn for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The boom reflects a strong rebound in asset prices from their pandemic lows of 2020 but it also shows how fund managers are using ETFs as an important instrument in portfolios, in some cases replacing or being used in conjunction with individual securities. Already a $9tn global market, the swift growth of the ETF universe is feeding a bullish view among big players, led by companies such as BlackRock, State Street and Invesco. ""It took 15 years for iShares to reach $1tn in assets, five years more to hit $2tn and just two more years to pass the $3tn mark,"" said Salim Ramji, global head of iShares and index investments at BlackRock. The asset manager expects the global market will expand to $15tn by 2025. BlackRock's iShares unit attracted net inflows of $75bn in the second quarter of this year and exceeded $3tn in assets in June, the group said on Wednesday. The quarterly flows were up from $51bn a year ago and accounted for the bulk of the asset manager's overall inflows of $81bn for the recent threemonth period. Hot areas of long-term growth include expanding investor activity in fixed income, a growing preference for model portfolios such as those targeting 60 per cent stocks and 40 per cent bonds by wealth advisers and also from the increasing popularity of mandates that take into account environmental, social and corporate governance standards. Among a number of growth drivers, traditional stock pickers that aim to buy companies that will beat the broader market's performance are increasing their use of ETFs in actively managed portfolios. ""Asset managers have found a way to participate in ETFs that provides them with the ability to use their stockpicking and portfolio construction expertise,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of mutual fund and ETF research at CFRA. ""Adoption is accelerating with insurance companies and other institutional investors."" Assets held in the US model portfolio market will more than double from $4tn over the next five years to $10tn, according to BlackRock.    It expects half of the new investor inflow for its US ETF arm to come from model portfolios in the future, up from about a third in 2020. State Street, the third-largest ETF provider globally, is also expanding its model portfolios business. ""We are working on building partnerships with other providers as well as offering model portfolios, which we have developed in-house,"" said Rory Tobin, global head of ETFs at State Street Global Advisors. It teamed up with Natixis, the French asset manager, to offer model portfolios to US financial advisers via Bank of America's platform in late 2019. Bond ETFs have taken in new client money at a slower rate than their equities peers this year. Inflows have clocked in at $112bn in 2021 compared with $231bn for all of 2021, ETFGI data show. ""Fixed income is 10 years behind equities in their respective ETF life cycles,"" said Jason Bloom, head of fixed income and alternatives ETF strategy at Invesco. Before the launch of new ETFs, areas in fixed income including asset-backed securities and bank loans were not easily accessible for retail investors and even financial advisers, said Bloom. ""You now have access to parts of the fixed income markets that you didn't have before."" Bond ETFs emerged from the pandemic crash in March of 2020 with a reputation of having passed a stress test. A decision by the US Federal Reserve to buy ETFs tracking corporate bonds also played an important role in easing market turmoil and investor concerns about the product. However, Craig Siegenthaler, senior equity research analyst at Credit Suisse, noted that, if the benign market environment turns choppier, ETF providers could struggle to continue growing at such a swift pace. ""Most of the investment community is bullish on ETFs and fixed income is seen getting much bigger but, if we get a bear market, that will make it tougher for the industry to keep growing at the pace we have seen,"" he said.

8d57c5fce7956985308f,2021-07-16,Wizz chief 's bumper pay plan is a sign of the times,"I s the UK's latest pay bust-up ready for take-off? Proxy adviser ISS this week joined Glass Lewis in recommending that shareholders reject a plan for Wizz Air's József Váradi that could hand the founder and chief executive up to £100m over eight years. They called the potential windfall ""excessive"", raising concerns about the plan's structure and the focus on share price performance. To earn top whack, Váradi will need to more than double the airline's share price over five years, a compound annual growth rate of 20 per cent. To get anything at all, the shares must pass a 10 per cent growth rate, at which point the payouts start at £20m. This has the makings of a classic pay stink: uncomfortably big numbers for a boss who is already a 6 per cent shareholder, against the backdrop of a doubling in pay revolts at big UK-listed companies this year. The notable absence, so far, of vocal investor dissent may be down to a couple of factors. First, the Hungary-based, Jerseyregistered company has a rather international shareholder register, including a sizeable US following where private equity backer Indigo Partner is based. Second, the UK institutions that tend to police pay most assiduously don't hold the sway they once did. The rise of tracker funds isn't the issue so much as Brexit: Wizz Air, like rival Ryanair, has partially ""disenfranchised"" UK and US investors to meet EU ownership rules for airlines, including for the vote later this month. The £100m on offer may jar against a low-cost ethos and comparatively low-paid crew. But Váradi's performance isn't in doubt: the shares have more than tripled since its 2015 listing. And the airline has a better claim than most to be creating a high-risk, high-reward package to retain an entrepreneurial boss who is in demand, not least from the improbably high numbers who think a pandemic is a great time to start an airline. The plan is also longer-term than your bog-standard package. The targets are stretching, requiring adding about £7bn in market value at the top end. Unlike Cineworld's bonus scheme, the shares don't start from a bombed-out level but close to an all-time high. There are new reward plans for all employees. The broader context is the growing angst about the dearth of founder-led, high-growth businesses on the London market as well as concerns that the appeal of private equity ownership for executives (more money, fewer annoying questions) is leaching talent from the public markets. The boss of SSP, owner of travel-orientated baguette chain Upper Crust, this week turned in his apron after only two years for a job in private equity; the shares sank. Perhaps to soften the impression of unpalatably ruthless capitalist tendencies, Váradi's package contains ESG metrics, worth 10 per cent of the payout, an increasingly popular option that generally deserves more scrutiny. The emissions target falls squarely into the category of stuff they were going to do anyway.    On an emissions per revenue passenger kilometre basis, it goes hand in hand with ambitious growth plans that involve flying and emitting more, albeit using a newer, more efficient fleet than the competitors that it hopes to squeeze. Given that Wizz's emissions per RPK jumped last year as the pandemic emptied planes, pretty much the entirety of the promised 36 per cent reduction over the five years to March 2026 can be accounted for by a post-pandemic recovery in flying and larger aircraft already on order. If cramming more people on to lower-cost aircraft sounds part and parcel of the Wizz strategy, that's because it is. No wonder the ESG portion of Váradi's plan only pays out if the share price targets are hit. Does his proposed payout look toppy, given the chances he would abandon a company he calls his ""baby""? Yes. Would cutting the windfall 20 or 30 per cent have won over proxy firms? Unlikely. Would shareholders contest that he's worth retaining or begrudge him his millions if he actually hits the big target? Probably not. Just don't kid yourself that he's saving the planet in the meantime. helen.thomas@ft.com If cramming more people on to lower-cost jets sounds part and parcel of the strategy, that's because it is"

ab8cceb66641f252a4c0,2021-07-15,Brazil should pay for not halting deforestation,"Bolsonaro's government has ignored pressure from ESG investors Investor activism can be a powerful force for good. Holders of bonds and stocks are pressing companies and governments globally to improve governance, reduce carbon emissions, pursue gender balance and racial diversity, as well as deliver rising profits. But what if their targets ignore the pressure? This is the dilemma facing asset managers who clubbed together last year to put pressure on the Brazilian government and its far-right president Jair Bolsonaro to curb deforestation of the Amazon. The investor group, which has grown to encompass $7tn in assets under management, had five aims: the most important was a ""significant reduction"" in deforestation. Others included the enforcement of Brazil's Forest Code, and the prevention of fires in or near forest areas to prevent a repeat of the burning seen in 2019. Just over a year and several highlevel meetings later, the results are clear: deforestation has surged by 17 per cent in the first six months of 2021, according to preliminary government data. The impressive-sounding Forest Code is fast becoming a dead letter, because the agencies who police it have had their budgets gutted. Last month, the environment minister a close Bolsonaro ally quit amid a criminal investigation into whether he had colluded with illegal loggers to export Amazon timber. With most of their objectives unmet, what should the investors do now? The question is pressing because environmental experts believe as much as 40 per cent of the remaining Amazon forest is nearing a tipping point, where fires and droughts risk turning it into dry open savannah. Arguments for more time feel weak. Few believe that Bolsonaro, beholden to a noisy constituency of loggers, ranchers and evangelicals, will change his ways in the final 18 months of his term. Budgets for environmental agencies can be restored at a pen stroke and enforcement stepped up, if the political will exists. Brazil has shown in the recent past, notably during 2009-17, that it can reduce deforestation sharply when it wishes to. The government's recent pledge to send the army back to the Amazon to combat deforestation repeats a failed strategy; properly funded environmental agencies have proved far more successful in the past. The investor group's members did not say what would happen if their targets were not met. Some argue that continued engagement is preferable to selling and losing influence a thesis often used to defend continued investment in fossil fuel producers. Not all is lost. The Bolsonaro administration's cavalier disregard for the country's natural wealth is not shared by many Brazilian businesses. Companies exporting to Europe and America are alarmed by the risk of consumer or investor boycotts if government inaction makes the Brazil brand too toxic. Some Brazilian companies are aiming to match the best global standards on ESG metrics; they deserve encouragement. Even the meat sector, a late convert, has woken up to the need for credible methods of tracing the origin of the cattle it slaughters, though implementation is too slow. Yet in the case of the Bolsonaro government, a year of high-level dialogue has coincided with a sharp deterioration in the Amazon. Continued engagement in such circumstances risks undermining the credibility of a commitment to ESG. In a year of exceptional circumstances amid the pandemic, it has been difficult to discern an environmental discount on Brazilian government bonds. This needs to change. It is time for investors to send a $7tn signal to Brasília that unless deforestation abates, they will sell."

61b87cdfe7c7a84c9c6b,2021-07-14,Vanguard picks start-up for its first acquisition,"Financials Vanguard, the world's second-largest asset manager, has made the first acquisition in its 46-year history, with a deal for a US start-up that builds bespoke portfolios for individual investors. Pennsylvania-based Vanguard has shunned acquisitions since it was founded in 1975 by Jack Bogle, preferring to concentrate on championing low-cost index-tracking investment strategies that follow broad benchmarks such as the S&P 500 or FTSE 100. But yesterday Vanguard, which has roughly $7.9tn worth of assets under management, announced that it had agreed to buy Just Invest, a Californiabased wealth management boutique that has developed a customisable, direct indexing offer. Direct indexing allows investors to tweak existing indices to create bespoke portfolios that can include tilts to investment factors, such as value or growth, or to match their environmental, social and governance (ESG) beliefs. ""Technology-driven solutions such as direct indexing continue to reshape our industry, driving better investment outcomes and lowering costs for clients,"" said Tim Buckley, Vanguard chief executive. Just Invest, which was founded in 2016 and manages about $1bn of assets, uses large-scale data analysis, quantitative algorithms and risk modelling to construct customised portfolios. Buckley said Vanguard planned to roll out Just Invest's direct indexing capabilities to a wider set of clients, building on a pilot programme it has been running with the group and select financial advisers over the past 18 months. No price was announced for the deal. Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors newsletter, said that moving into direct indexing could enhance Vanguard's reputation for running tax-efficient port- folios. ""While Vanguard's funds are already extremely tax-efficient, direct indexing will allow some investors to generate losses that can be used to offset gains in other parts of their portfolios,"" said Wiener. Direct investing also provides Vanguard with the capacity to offer a broader range of sustainable strategies that rely on ESG metrics. ""Direct indexing definitely dovetails with Vanguard's desire to get into the ESG business with both feet. It has already launched several ESG exchange traded funds and can now offer even more highly customised ESG portfolios with direct indexing,"" said Wiener. Vanguard's acquisition follows similar deals by its rivals BlackRock and JPMorgan. BlackRock paid $1.05bn cash to buy California-based Aperio Group, which manages $45bn in taxoptimised separately managed accounts, from Golden Gate Capital, a private equity manager, in November.    Morgan Stanley last year acquired Eaton Vance for $7bn, a deal that included the Parametric unit, which oversees customised client portfolios worth more than $300bn. Direct indexing is largely restricted to wealthier investors but the involvement of Vanguard and BlackRock will accelerate its expansion into the mass market. 'Direct indexing definitely dovetails with Vanguard's desire to get into the ESG business with both feet'"

a1bf07118c19903e5dde,2021-07-13,Norway's $1.3tn oil fund to purge ESG 'rotten apples' from buy list............................................................................179,"Pressure builds to pursue large deals, but the perils of chasing growth through acquisitions have never been clearer As US asset managers strain to prove that big is better, Jean Pierre Mustier, one of Europe's best known bankers, believes competitors on the continent are better off leaving that mantra to Americans. ""European asset managers should not have a 'US complex',"" the former head of UniCredit, Italy's largest lender, told a Financial Times conference. ""The US has a deep capital market, a deep base of investors, and it is extremely difficult to compete with this."" Casting off any inferiority complex, however, is easier said than done as US investment groups embark on a series of mergers and acquisitions designed to shield profits from rising costs and falling fees. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, eight European firms made the list of the world's 20 biggest asset managers compiled by Willis Towers Watson, accounting for 37 per cent of the group's total assets. Fast forward a decade and only five remain, controlling just 19 per cent of the assets managed by the top 20. It is why expectations are rising that European asset managers will have little choice but to execute their own deals or be left further behind. Revenues from traditional asset management vehicles such as actively managed mutual funds will shrink by nearly a third equal to about $16bn in fees lost by the end of 2024, according to Morgan Stanley, intensifying the trend of the last decade. ""Everyone under the sun, whatever the size, is being shopped around by the banks,"" said a senior executive at a US investment group. ""From the pitchbooks we get, there is a disproportionate amount of focus on Europe."" But as pressure builds on the European industry to pursue deals, the perils of doing so have never been clearer. The annals of investment industry consolidation has more slow-motion car crashes than the Fast & Furious movie franchise. ""I think there'll be a lot more deals in asset management this year, but it won't necessarily make them any better or easier to pull off,"" Peter Harrison, the chief executive of Schroders, the London-based group that manages £574bn, told the FT. Schroders earlier this year considered a bid for M&G Investments, attracted by the private assets business of its London rival, according to a person familiar with the matter. Schroders ultimately decided against pursuing a deal due to concerns over a clash of cultures, the person said. With buoyant financial markets so far offering asset managers a cushion, tieups this year have been limited in scope. Amundi in April bought Lyxor's €825m exchange-traded fund business, and NN Investment Partners, a €293bn bondfocused Dutch asset manager, has been put on the block by its insurer parent. Final bids are imminent and UBS and Germany's DWS are among those who have registered their interest.    Given the advantages scale can bring, some industry insiders expect deals to be ambitious. Many big institutional investors increasingly want to work with a narrower club of asset managers, while retail investors gravitate towards well-known brands. Greater heft also helps absorb the mounting costs of technology, cyber security and back-office work like regulatory compliance. ""After the end of the global pandemic, the consolidation wave in the asset management industry should gain momentum again,"" Asoka Woehrmann, the chief executive of DWS, told shareholders at the €820bn group's annual general meeting last month. ""We want to be an active player in that field."" Despite the pandemic briefly unleashing mayhem across financial markets in the spring of 2020, the US industry pulled off two notable deals last year. Morgan Stanley Investment Management's and Franklin Templeton's acquisitions of Eaton Vance and Legg Mason, respectively, catapulted both into the $1tn-in-assets club. Nor is it only in the industry's top flight that Europe has lost ground. A decade ago, 20 of the 50 biggest investment groups in the world were European. Today, Europe accounts for just 11. Credit Suisse data indicates that BlackRock alone is bigger than the five largest European investment groups combined. US passive giant Vanguard has one investment vehicle the $1.2tn Total Stock Market Index Fund that is bigger than the entire asset base of Schroders, Axa Investment Managers and Abrdn on their own. Despite charging a management fee of only 4 basis points, the Vanguard fund generates revenues at a similar level to the UK's Jupiter Fund Management. Set against the benefits of scale are the hazards in trying to achieve it. Anne Richards, the head of $738bn asset manager Fidelity International, put it starkly. ""There are more examples of M&A in our sector that haven't worked out well than have worked out well,"" she told the FT's Future of Asset Management conference. Dealmakers caution that defensive transactions driven primarily by cost synergies are among the most challenging to pull off. Lay-offs and mergers can disrupt the investment culture, hurting performance and resulting in outflows. Troubled mergers leading to poor share performance including Invesco's $5.7bn acquisition in 2018 of Oppenheimer and the tie-up between Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management have spooked many executives contemplating bigger deals. ""Consolidation in a people business is very hard,"" said Vincent Bounie, senior managing director at Fenchurch Advisory, a specialist investment bank for financial services. ""It can look good on paper you think businesses can be complementary, and you can take out costs and run more assets. But if you destabilise your key teams and people, you risk destabilising clients, which leads to significant risk of value destruction."" If the need for scale is regarded as paramount, it is not the only dynamic set to shape deals in a European industry increasingly bifurcated between specialist boutiques and larger players who can keep costs low. Credit Suisse analysts expect M&A to be driven by strategic considerations: either to sow the seeds for future organic growth by bringing in investment skills in fast-growing areas such as private assets, exchange traded funds and ESG, or to add new distribution channels. For example, foreign asset managers are rushing to capitalise on regulatory changes that are opening up China's vast pool of savings. Notably, asset classes that cannot be easily replicated by low-cost exchange traded funds, including direct lending, private equity, real estate investment and venture capital, are now some of the most prized targets. Within Europe, groups such as Schroders, Abrdn, Edmond de Rothschild Group and RWC Partners have all earmarked private markets as an area for expansion. ""Private markets are structurally growing and the economics are very attractive,"" said an investment banker who specialises in finance industry deals. ""These funds have locked-up capital, charge high fees and are under no threat from passive replication. It's a great business model."" Private assets strategies are growing fast thanks to enormous demand from institutional investors such as pension plans that are hunting for yield. Morgan Stanley estimates the private capital industry now manages over $7.4tn, and expects that to grow to $13tn by the end of 2025. Mustier argues that smaller but strategic deals in areas such as private markets make far more sense than simply getting larger in a vainglorious attempt to compete with American competitors. The next year is likely to show whether European industry asset managers decide to resist the pressure.    'There are more examples of M&A that haven't worked out well than have worked out well'"

13ea2513905d83a4afc7,2021-07-07,JPMorgan in largest buying spree for years,"Banks JPMorgan Chase has made more than 30 acquisitions in 2021, putting the biggest US bank by assets on track for its largest buying spree in years. The acquisitions, mostly of smaller companies ranging from an online money manager in Britain to a Brazilian digital bank, are a sign of how Jamie Dimon, chief executive, is turning to deals to expand the banking group. Parts of the bank's core business have been bogged down by low interest rates and are confronting greater competition from fintechs and unregulated lenders. Dimon flagged last year that JPMorgan would be ""more aggressive in acquisitions across the board"". The bank has done 33 deals in 2021, one shy of its total for the whole of 2020, according to data from Refinitiv. The prices of most of the deals were not publicly disclosed. Nine took place in June, including two last week: the purchase of OpenInvest, a platform that allows customers to customise a portfolio based on environmental, social and governance metrics, and a minority stake in the Brazilian digital bank C6. This followed its acquisitions of Nutmeg, a UK digital wealth management platform, for about $700m and Campbell Global, a forest management and timberland investment company. In March, JPMorgan also took a 10 per cent stake in China Merchants Bank's wealth management business for about $410m. ""It's a string of pearls approach where they buy smaller fintech firms to better advance the asset management business with lower cultural, operating and goodwill hurdles than come with a large acquisition,"" said Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo. ""The focus appears to be on companies that can support JPMorgan's digital strategies or companies that can give the company an advantage in the rapidly growing area of ESG investing,"" said James Shanahan, analyst at Edward Jones. The emphasis on smaller acquisitions highlights the hurdles to JPMorgan doing a larger deal for a rival bank, which would run up against regulatory caps on deposits. Ultimately, the deals represent an attempt to find revenue streams beyond traditional banking services an imperative Dimon addressed at a conference in June. ""I think the banking system is going to be really in tough shape. That's my own personal view. And there will be winners in there, but it won't be all of them,"" Dimon said.

006c9048fc45b87062f0,2021-07-07,Climate issues should already be part of accounts,"T he world of climate reporting gives the financial crisis a run for its money on acronyms. Coming together in the effort to standardise how the world should define and track corporate sustainability is a collection of interested parties, including the CDSB, the TCFD, the IIRC and the SASB (the latter two of which are now known as the VRF). Others such as the GRI and the CDP are also involved. You don't really need to know what all these stand for, or what they've done to date. They all care about having consistent reporting concerning environmental, social and governance issues and are working with the IFRS Foundation to set up an International Sustainability Standards Board, or the ISSB. That will be the sustainability standards setter alongside its accounting equivalent, the IASB. That a project aimed at clarity manages to be quite so confusing in its genesis is less than ideal. But having a robust set of standards to track corporate emissions, water usage or other social or environmental factors is important, given that the world of ESG data and sustainable investing is a bit of a mess. A separate, but related, question is to what extent consideration of climate change is already factored into accounts today, particularly the financial statements. Bottom line: it should be, but largely isn't. The international accounting body has gone out of its way to clarify this point. Yes, the International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, do not explicitly mention climate-related issues. But the rule-setters said last November that climate matters should be reflected in financial statements where that information could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions made by users of the accounts. One area of focus is the future cash flows expected when testing an asset for impairment, and the judgments and uncertainties surrounding that calculation. Others include valuation and risk around financial instruments, the value of inventories, or the residual value or useful lives of assets. Requirements to disclose any other material information covers, well, just about everything else. This is not happening. ""There is no clear evidence that companies consider their strategic goals or climate-related risks in the preparation of their financial accounts"", said Barbara Davidson at Carbon Tracker. She has been leading an analysis of accounts focused on Climate Action 100+ companies, the largest emitters globally, with a report due in August. Even groups that provide climate targets and talk about transition tend to have financial reporting that reflects ""business as usual"", she says although UK companies do better, with the US bringing up the rear. This is not just a question for fossil fuel companies such as BP and Shell, which have both announced writedowns of assets as the prospect of lower oil demand filters through to the numbers. The analysis for Unilever, which along with a selection of others has already been published, cites ""some concerns"" about accounting judgments and consistency with other reporting, and ""significant concerns"" in other areas such as the visibility of climate assumptions, and the consideration of climate factors in the audit. And Unilever is, rightly given its recent plans around climate and transition, considered something of a leader in the ESG stakes.    A recurrent complaint of investors is that statements made in front-half reporting, such as the strategic review or management commentary, tend not to match the back half where the numbers are (a consistency check between them is one job of the auditors). In other words, the story being spun about commitments to net zero in the glossy picture pages is not reflected in the numbers, footnotes and other wonky disclosure. Climate should, surely, already be a focus for the audit. But it is notable, says Paul Lee, head of stewardship at consultants Redington and a contributor to the analysis, how few audit reports mention the use of experts in climate or carbon markets, even as audit firms trumpet their credentials to vet sustainability information more generally. Yes, the world needs better, more consistent standards around sustainability. But that is no reason to luxuriate in the status quo while those are developed. The impact of climate change should already be evident in company accounts. helen.thomas@ft.com The story being spun about commitments to net zero in glossy picture pages is not reflected in the numbers"
f5f0c05861f5b640d9bf,2021-07-06,Companies that spurn ESG will be punished,"Letters Robert Armstrong (Unhedged, FT.com, June 25) argues that environmental, social and governance investing only makes the world a better place by offering lower expected returns. That, he says, is a necessary corollary of a lower cost of capital which ""good"" companies achieve by attracting more investment. The argument is flawed on a number of counts. I worked in listed companies for 25 years, and I never once heard senior management beg us to please decrease the cost of capital. The messaging was always about increasing the stock price for shareholders, and in particular those shareholders who owned large amounts of shares and make decisions for the company. Armstrong's argument against trying to excel on ESG would also apply to trying to excel on quality management. It suggests that managers would be well advised to not get a reputation for managing the company well, because they would thereby lower the cost of capital and therefore the expected return. In reality, the argument for making money by investing in companies with good ESG credentials is the same as the argument for making money on wellmanaged companies. Armstrong seems to define ""underperforming"" as delivering a lower return. He should know that ""underperforming"" means delivering a lower return per unit of risk. Does he think that triple A bonds ""underperform"" triple B bonds because they deliver a lower return? Wellmanaged companies, including wellmanaged companies because of their ESG practices, may well return less, but the only relevant question is whether their risk/return profile is inferior, and he does not address that. Interestingly, Armstrong continues this line of reasoning, where he notes that emerging markets equities have ""outperformed"" the S&P 500. The reason he hasn't had much ""fun"" owning them, is that the risk/return profile of his ""outperforming"" assets has been poor, compared with the S&P 500. I thought we had moved beyond the return-only view of investments and into the risk/return view a generation ago, but perhaps not. These days, few sophisticated practitioners suggest that ESG investing is about ""making the world a better place"". It's about delivering positive impact alongside a marketcompetitive financial return as the Impact Investing Institute's increasingly large evidence base across asset classes, sectors and geographies demonstrates. Sustainable companies are, in the long term, likely to be the only ones that will deliver genuinely sustainable profit streams. Why? Because regulation and consumers will increasingly punish those companies that don't pursue positive ESG policies, whether that means reducing carbon emissions or adhering to decent work standards.

1276548063e81604220a,2021-07-06,Dublin must take bold steps to restore banking sector normality,"INSIDE BUSINESS FINANCE A decade on from the financial crisis, Dublin is running out of reasons to continue owning the majority of the banking sector. Ireland bailed out three banks in 2011-12 at a cost of almost €30bn. The choice was to pull out the cheque book or let the system collapse and unleash chaos. But the cost forced the country into an EU-IMF rescue programme and triggered years of austerity. The recent announcement of a gradual sale of the country's 13.9 per cent stake in Bank of Ireland, Ireland's second-biggest lender, is an acknowledgment at last by the government of how times have changed. The country's economy posted some of Europe's best growth rates in recent years as it emerged from the post-crisis wasteland. But Dublin will have to take bolder steps if it is to restore normality to a sector that is the backbone of the economy. As well as its BoI holding, the state owns 71 per cent of the country's biggest bank, AIB, and 75 per cent of the much smaller Permanent TSB. Financiers say public ownership is dragging the sector down. One says the best thing the government could do for AIB's share price is to sell a few shares, or lay out a plan to do so, so that investors could see a path to normality. ""When investors talk about ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) with AIB, the G is the biggest thing,"" the financier says, describing the government's presence on the share register as problematic for others considering investing. The problem is such investors do not know when the government will dump the stock. Government ownership also tangles public policy and commercial decisionmaking. Pearse Doherty, finance spokesman for the biggest opposition party, says the government should continue to hold the majority of AIB so the state can ""pursue its strategic interests when key decisions and transactions take place"". He sees the case for strategic ownership as particularly strong now that Ireland is headed for a ""duopoly"" with the imminent withdrawal of KBC and Ulster Bank, which say they cannot make enough money. One financier thing the could do for price is to sell or lay out a Doherty's stance might be a winner with voters but probably would not be with other investors whose interest is in profits, not national strategic priorities. Ireland's reluctance to launch a mass sell-off is more about price though, than Doherty's concerns. The BoI sale is palatable because, by Dublin's somewhat creative maths, Ireland will have made a net profit of €2bn on its €4.7bn BoI investment if its remaining shares are sold at their market value on the day the government announced its plans. Paschal Donohoe, finance minister, understandably will not publicly disclose the minimum share price he has set for banks carrying out the gradual sale of BoI stock over six months.    However, you can bet it's a number that will allow him to claim the invest- ment delivered a net profit. Even if that net profit was calculated selectively, on a basis that includes the almost €1.5bn in fees BoI has paid for state guarantees. The Department of Finance also makes no mention of the cost of servicing the debt Ireland took on so it could bail out its banks, a figure that Ireland's Comptroller & Auditor General estimated at €2.5bn spread across Ireland's three surviving banks and the defunct Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide. The narrative is trickier for AIB, rescued at a cost of €20.7bn. The government is in the red to the tune of about €6bn, after taking into account proceeds of AIB's partial float in 2017, other income received from the bank and the residual holding's value. That €6bn gap ? and the fact that AIB's shares are trading at around 50 per cent of their 2017 listing price ? goes some way to explaining Donohoe's statement last week that there are no immediate plans to sell AIB stock. Other arguments against selling now include the idea that offering both banks concurrently could saturate the market and result in lower prices all around. The government might be holding off too because of hopes that the stakes will be worth more later. The irony is that, in practical terms, how much Ireland gets is not that significant for the economy. Karl Whelan, economist at University College Dublin, says any money is likely to be used to pay down debt, since EU budget rules make it hard to spend windfalls on things such as health and housing. What matters more for Ireland's future is a healthy and normalised banking market, one where the state is not exposed to the vagaries of banks' share prices rising or falling. laura.noonan@ft.com One financier says the best thing the government could do for AIB's share price is to sell a few shares , or lay out a plan to do so"

Hotels, airlines and travel companies all report a rise in corporate bookings over recent weeks as executives return to the road following months of virtual meetings and video conferences. The recovery is patchy and led by domestic markets where travel is easiest, but the industry has, nonetheless, welcomed signs of pent-up demand. ""Where government restrictions have been removed, we are seeing demand return very strongly,"" said Paul Abbott, chief executive at American Express Global Business Travel, AmEx GBT. Bookings from financial and professional services companies were returning strongly, Abbott said, but the rise was being led by small and mediumsized companies, who could ""just make decisions faster"". As vaccines have rolled out, the recovery has been fastest in the US, with international travel in Europe more muted because of restrictions. However, international travel in Europe is still rising 2 percentage points per week and corporate bookings for domestic flights and hotels in countries such as France are surging, with hotel bookings at 80 per cent of 2019 levels. Hotel and air bookings in Spain and the Nordics are about 50 per cent of 2019 levels, according to AmEx GBT data. In the US, the opening is starting to gather pace with Las Vegas hosting the World of Concrete, its first major convention since the start of the pandemic, in early June, and major US airlines, including American, reporting a rise in bookings from corporate clients. Hotel groups including Hyatt, Accor, Marriott International and InterContinental have all noted the same trend. Marriott said that US corporate demand was 50 per cent of 2019 levels in May, while at Hyatt, group corporate bookings in the first quarter of 2021 were up 55 per cent compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Despite signs of demand for business trips, it is still unclear how much will be permanently lost because of a pandemic overhang, widespread use of software such as Zoom and pressure on companies from investors with ESG agendas to reduce unnecessary travel."
ffbb265d077a38707bfb,2021-07-05,Schroders chief urges reform to stop raid on UK plc,"Financial services Low valuations, tax rules on debt and burdens on listed groups behind grab Private equity groups will continue their raid on UK plc unless there is a sweeping reform of City rules to lighten the load on public companies, according to the chief executive of one of Britain's largest asset managers. ""Is it a raid? It's certainly evident that it's happening,"" said Peter Harrison, chief executive of Schroders, adding that it was an ""inevitable consequence"" of the UK's governance regime and of the tax deductibility of debt. In the first half of this year private equity firms announced bids for UKlisted companies at the fastest pace in more than two decades, taking advantage of depressed valuations as a result of Brexit and the pandemic. On Saturday a trio of private investment groups, led by SoftBank-owned Fortress, announced a £9.5bn deal to acquire Wm Morrison, Britain's fourthlargest supermarket chain. Meanwhile, New York-based Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, which made an unsolicited takeover offer for Morrisons that was rejected last month, has also bid for London-listed UDG Healthcare. US private equity group Blackstone has swooped on British logistics and housing developer St Modwen Properties. Harrison said the UK governance code was ""written at the expense of public companies"" and could be ""very onerous"" on them, pointing at everything from disclosure requirements to remuneration rules. He applauded a government-backed review that called for an overhaul of listing rules, including the introduction of dual-class shares favoured by entrepreneurs, so that London could better compete with New York. He noted that regulators were also looking at changes to UK fund rules to help offer retail investors access to less liquid assets such as private equity, private debt, real estate and infrastructure. Last month, Schroders combined all of its private markets activities under the newly formed Schroders Capital, which has $65bn of assets under management. Harrison said the group was ""pretty agnostic"" as to how it packaged its investment skills. ""Ultimately, we've got to grow the wealth of our customers,"" he said. ""The move towards private assets is a reflection of the fact that that's where the puck is going."" Harrison was speaking as Schroders and Oxford Sciences Innovation, an early-stage venture capital firm, announced they had bought a minority stake in Natural Capital Research, a research organisation. NCR uses scientific research to help its clients develop ESG, biodiversity and net zero carbon strategies. ""Viewing nature as an asset and putting it on the same balance sheet as a company's other resources is no longer seen as an oddity,"" said Kathy Willis, director of NCR.    Harrison said: ""The opportunity is far bigger than this transaction implies because it's making a statement about natural capital as an asset. Until it's measured, no one will pay attention. But what gets measured gets managed."" Private equity announced bids for UK companies at the fastest pace in more than two decades"
5d23d628922d864daec6,2021-07-03,How much is bad maths costing Britain? It's the most vulnerable consumers who stand to gain most from a clearer approach,"Claer Barrett Serious Money H ere's a number that should concern us all about 20m people in Britain have poor numeracy skills. It is estimated that under half of UK working-age adults have numeracy skills lower than that expected of an 11-year-old child, causing big problems in the workplace. Dame Sharon White, chair of John Lewis, made headlines last month when she complained that the retailer had been forced to give basic numeracy classes to its younger staff. This knowledge gap has a massive impact on how well people manage their personal finances and their ability to comprehend household bills. Could changing the way financial information is presented to customers make a difference? Yes. This week, a research study from the Plain Numbers, a social enterprise, has shown that making small tweaks to the way bills were presented doubled customer comprehension, on average. The social enterprise, an offshoot of the National Numeracy charity, conducted controlled trials with about 5,000 customers of companies including Direct Line, Atlanta Insurance, Octopus Energy, Thames Water and ClearScore, the credit reference agency. Half of customers received their usual bill, but the other half were sent an optimised Plain Numbers version (think Plain English but for numbers). Both groups were then asked five questions to gauge their understanding. For example, the insurance customers were quizzed about the impact of paying for a policy monthly (where interest is charged) versus paying annually (where it isn't). Similarly, customers comparing balance transfer deals were asked to pick which credit card would enable them to pay off their debts soonest. The upshot? Across five trials, Plain Numbers customers were nearly twice as likely to answer 4 out of 5 comprehension questions correctly (47 per cent versus 24.6 per cent). So what kind of magic wand did they wave? Essentially, they removed jargon and unnecessary numbers to make financial information less intimidating. The organisation quotes historian Yuval Noah Harari: ""Humans think in stories rather than facts, numbers or equations and the simpler the story, the better."" The ""story"" is what consumers are ultimately trying to achieve. For those comparing balance transfer deals on credit cards, the simplest story is: ""If I pay off £X a month, I'll be debt free by this date, and save £Y in interest."" As well as boosting comprehension, the simplest story can also soothe worries. For energy customers, Plain Numbers rounded payments to the nearest pound (removing 14 numerals from the page) and used simple headlines to summarise the details: ""Overall, you used £79 more energy than you paid for this month, but that's OK it's winter, and for most people it evens out over the whole year.""    The five companies who took part in the trial have all committed to embedding the approach and the group now hopes to work with more organisations to do the same. While the results of the initial trial are impressive, the challenge ahead is considerable. Even on the Plain Numbers version of the bills, more than half of consumers (53 per cent) couldn't correctly answer four out of five comprehension questions. That's clearly better than the 75 per cent who failed to do so using the standard bills but echoing Dame Sharon's comments on the education system, poor numeracy isn't something that can be completely ""designed out"" of financial products and services. Second, the trials showed that six out of 10 participants thought they had understood the information, although the comprehension scores above show many clearly hadn't. This ""perception gap"" is where the potential for bad financial decisions and even mis-selling could occur, so any steps to reduce it would be worthwhile. Struggling with numbers is a national problem, says Mike Ellicock, the founder of Plain Numbers, but boosting engagement requires unpicking a complex mix of skills, attitudes and behaviour that convinces people that they ""can't do numbers"". He believes much of this stems from an aversion to maths in school. Its initial research has been praised by the Bank of England and the FCA, which believe it has much wider applications. But I wonder how it might be received by financial firms? I have long argued in this column that consumer inertia and lack of understanding are key drivers of profit for financial services. The FCA has cracked down on some of the most egregious examples, including the ""loyalty premium"" paid by customers who fail to shop around for the best deal on their insurance (not doing so has cost 6m policyholders an estimated £1.2bn). It has also demanded remedies for credit card customers in persistent debt. Making the minimum payment every month might feel cheap, but it's hugely costly. Borrow £3,000 aged 21, and you'll be almost 50 by the time the debt is cleared and have paid an additional £4,000 in interest. I am sure the Plain Numbers approach could work wonders for customers here. Ellicock says customers who understand what they're buying and feel it is fair value are more likely to complete purchases and remain loyal. Early evidence suggests it's the most vulnerable consumers who stand to gain most from a clearer approach. As ESG (environmental, social and governance) concerns rise up the boardroom agenda, this could convince directors and shareholders of consumer-facing companies that a more radical shift is needed. I'd like to think the plain numbers approach won't stop at consumer bills, and could extend to DIY investors. From high fees to the mis-selling of high-risk investments and outright scams, the potential for financial harm is vast. Pension freedoms have made it possible for millions to gain early access to their retirement savings, often without any guidance from a professional adviser. As well as communicating the facts more clearly, should providers ask some simple comprehension questions before letting people make potentially wealth-destroying decisions? I would welcome readers' answers to this costly conundrum.

a1c5e54cc83c8120f985,2021-07-03,Beating private equity buyers at their own game,"Merryn Somerset Webb Investing W hy weren't all UK fund managers invested in Wm Morrison when the recent bid for the supermarket chain came in? If it was cheap enough for private equity firm CDR to want it, why was it not cheap enough for traditional fund managers to be holding? I wrote about this last week, suggesting that fund managers have little grounds for complaint about losing out on the initial price rise or on any further increases should a buyout go ahead at some point. But there is another way to look at it. You could argue businesses are worth more to private equity companies than public shareholders. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is volatility. Publicly listed shares are volatile. Private equity holdings, which aren't often priced, are not. Another is the one-owner effect: disparate groups of shareholders find it hard to force management to do their bidding. PE owners (holding 100 per cent of a company and speaking with one voice) do not. Then there is financial engineering PE is less wary of debt than perhaps it should be. As its managers tend to encourage higher levels of debt, they put a higher value on steady cash flow (required to pay the interest on that debt) than perhaps the public market does. More cynically you might say companies have more value to PE than traditional managers because they charge higher fees for holding them. Mix this up and even with some large pinches of salt, it feels like there is some sense in the idea that a PE manager should pay more to take a company private than a traditional manager will pay to keep it public. I don't buy all of it of course. I am, for example, buried under missives from fund managers telling me about their active ESG policies at the moment. Believe the PR and you must believe they all spend most waking hours haranguing company managers about various bits of dogoodery and that they do this with significant success. But if their voice works so well with this, why doesn't haranguing companies about their balance sheet structure and business practices work? We will have to leave that as one of the great mysteries of finance it's a long list and accept it as just the way it is. If it were not, no public companies would ever be taken private by PE. However, as Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates points out, there is another complication here. The criteria on which PE target companies are valued in the market is not exactly a secret. The ""knowledge is distributed around the market"". Everyone knows the current price of a listed company, the price they themselves would pay, and the price a PE firm could pay. Back to Morrisons. ""The chances of it being bid for are now 100 per cent,"" points out Smithers. What was it before? Obviously very much lower.    If fund managers figured the probability of a bid was quite low they put a lower value on the shares than they would otherwise. This, of course, made it more attractive to private equity. So the managers who weren't holding Morrisons last week were guilty of getting their probability calculations wrong. Nonetheless, fund managers interested in value have a problem. Buying what look like cheap stocks and waiting for them to go up without correctly calculating the odds of the arrival of a catalyst can present what we might call material career risk. As several readers have pointed out and I suspect there are ex-fund managers or even frustrated current fund managers among them to survive you have to deliver performance year in year out. If you don't, money will head for the doors the same exit you will also eventually be pointed towards. If you are going to go for value you have to identify some kind of catalyst for that value to be released. You have to know private equity is on the way or an activist investor is about to kick up a stink within a year or so. Without that certainty about value and change you have to leave the value on the table and stick with shares in companies that show obvious growth (like everyone else). So mostly you leave the value on the table. Even the most determined of value investors have to recognise this. Look to the Scottish Investment Trust (which I hold) and its high conviction, contrarian value approach for example. We never buy a stock because it is cheap, says trust manager Alasdair McKinnon. ""The quantitative appeal of the valuation must be mirrored by qualitative attractions. Crucially, there must be clear catalysts for improvement; we want the company to positively surprise."" Even that isn't always enough. McKinnon's trust has done well in the last six months but underperformed over three and five years. The board, while not necessarily planning to change manager, is inviting alternative management proposals. See why most managers end up leaving value on the table? That's bad news for most fund investors. But here's the thing: it is really good news for the kind of investors who are happy buying individual shares. You can wait three years, five years or even more for the catalyst particularly if you are collecting dividends along the way. You need some certainty about value, but very little about change. No time-sensitive probability calculations are required. In some sense then, your calculations of value are closer to those of a PE investor than a fund manager you can pay a little more than they can. How do you capitalise on this? The UK market is vulnerable to PE at the moment as it's one of the cheapest global markets. So a FTSE 100 ETF isn't a bad way to start (you'll get a bit of all uplifts). The brave and patient can go a step further, recognise that they don't need ""clear catalysts"" and make their own portfolio of cheap stocks. Choose your long-term target McKinnon suggests engineering group Babcock. The shares are down 70 per cent in the last five years. No one has much good to say about the firm or its accounting. But it has a perfectly good new management team. That team might improve matters. Or a PE buyer might. Buy and wait. Merryn Somerset Webb is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek.

84faeb4c6db1d842da52,2021-07-03,Pop Ludovic Hunter-Tilney,"Sault Nine Forever Living Originals **** Sault area mysterious British group who don't show themselves in public or give interviews. They release albums at a profuse rate: two in 2019, then another two in 2020. As the chorus of praise has grown, they have resisted any temptation to drop the veil of secrecy. ""Don't need an ego anyway"" ran a refrain in a song called ""Free"" from last year's album Untitled (Rise). Their determination to let the music speak for itself has a polemical edge. Black struggle is a recurrent theme in their songs, a soundtrack for the new civil rights era of the Black Lives Matter movement. It draws on a range of styles, triangulating between the UK, the US and Africa. Echoes of Soul II Soul, D'Angelo, Fela Kuti and ESG give their songs a vintage feel, yet they don't sound retro. Instead, there's a powerful sense of timeliness. The past feeds into the present. Meanwhile the future is at stake. Nine is their new album. Available as a free download on Sault's website, it will be withdrawn from circulation 99 days after its release. The tripled numbers represent 999, the British telephone number for the emergency services. It's a reference partly to policing, a prime focus for Black Lives Matter protests against racism. But Nine's 99-day lifespan also refers to a state of emergency in present-day London among the city's Afro- Caribbean communities. The album opens with a playground chant involving what sounds like a children's choir. Titled ""Haha"", the track's laughter acquires a bitter quality as themes of lost childhood and destroyed families take shape. ""London Gangs"" sets the tone with a thick distorted bassline and stuttering drums. A female vocalist recites lyrics about the city's intensifying levels of youth violence. The music is claustrophobic punk-funk, which lifts momentarily to allow a singer to utter a darkly ironic pun on Sault's band name: ""The salt will heal the wounds."" Although the songs carry no extra information, previous albums have been credited to the producer Inflo, aka Dean Wynton Josiah Cover. Credited singers on those earlier albums included rapper Kid Sister and soul singer Cleo Sol, who presumably reprise their roles on Nine. The only named participants on its nine tracks are a Londoner called Michael Ofo, who relates his father's murder on ""Mike's Story"", and the rapper Little Simz, who guests on ""You From London"". (Inflo is Simz's regular producer for her solo work.) ""Trap Life"" has a dense percussive energy, with chanted lyrics about wanting to be free from postcode wars and police oppression. ""Fear"" locks into a powerful groove with distorted melodies as a male vocalist recites lyrics about pain and rage. The claustrophobia seems to lift for ""Bitter Streets"" with a light bossa nova beat, but a repetitive vocal melody by a female singer sinuously creates a different kind of enclosure. ""You From London"" is the album's only mis-step, an irritating reproach to an imagined American audience that thinks London is a place of crumpets, bad teeth and royals, not entrenched social and racial problems. A better transatlantic understanding is broached by ""Light's in Your Hands"", which excels at the typically American form of    the empowerment ballad. It includes a man's spokenword account of having a childhood wrecked by gang violence. Giving voice to the unheard is the point of Nine, not bringing visibility or celebrity to its creators. Laura Mvula Pink Noise Atlantic Records **** ""Nothing is impossible,"" Laura Mvula sang on her last album, 2016's The Dreaming Room. A similar credo governed its songs, which occupied a bold space of Mvula's devising. The Birmingham-raised singersongwriter sang as a teenager with a cappella choir Black Voices and studied classical composition. On her debut, 2013's Sing to the Moon, and The Dreaming Room, she demonstrated her gift for applying inventive orchestration and arrangements to soul, pop and R&B. But lack of a commercial breakthrough led to her being unceremoniously dropped by her label, Sony. ""Another blow to the ego,"" she utters on new song ""Conditional"". It appears on her third album, Pink Noise, which follows a rethink in her approach. Signed to a new label, Atlantic, she has chosen to pursue a more narrowly defined area of music. The style looks back at the bright resonances of the 1980s, a world of echoing drums, splashy synthesisers, slap bass and smoothly funky guitar parts. Prince's influence is prominent (he invited her to tour with him in 2014). She drops a lyrical reference to ""Purple Rain"" into ""Magical"". But there's nothing second-hand about Pink Noise. Mvula inhabits its songs completely. They are sleekly designed, yet there is an impressive amount of musical activity. ""Remedy"" has a propulsive core around which horns and electronic melodies ring out. ""Magical"" is a big pop-soul number that builds up layers of instrumentation into towering peaks. Mvula's vocals are similarly dynamic, moving from stentorian cries and rhythmic monotones to softer, higher tones. The full possibilities of her new sound are realised. Bobby Gillespie and Jehnny Beth Utopian Ashes Third Man Records *** The greatest duet album about marital break-up is George Jones's and Tammy Wynette's Golden Ring. It was released in 1976, one year after the country stars had divorced each other in real life. Jones was a violent alcoholic who, according to Wynette, once threatened her with a loaded gun. But they reunited for Golden Ring, which became their most successful album as singing partners. Its title track is a classic example of Nashville storytelling about a couple buying a wedding ring from a pawnshop. After their marriage fails the ring ends up back in the pawnshop, where another couple buy it. The cycle of weddings and heartbreak goes endlessly onwards. ""One thing's for certain,"" Jones sings, voicing the role of the angry wife flinging the ring to the floor, ""I don't love you any more."" Forty-five years later the golden ring has been gathered up by another singing duo, Primal Scream's singer Bobby Gillespie and his counterpart from postpunk band Savages, Jehnny Beth. Their joint album, Utopian Ashes, is themed around the idea of a failing marriage between a hard-living man and his disillusioned wife. Its opening track, ""Chase It Down"", contains an overt nod to Jones and Wynette. ""I don't even love you any more,"" Gillespie sings, echoing the dismal sentiment from ""Golden Ring"". The indie veteran sounds washed-out and enfeebled. In contrast, Beth sings her part briskly. Both swap country music storytelling for rock clichés about redemption and seizing the moment. But the music is more engaging than the routine riffage that often accompanies it ? especially in the work of Primal Scream. Gillespie's band, makers of 1991's Screamadelica, have been on a downwards spiral since 2006's Riot City Blues. Here, he's joined by Scream bandmates Andrew Innes, Martin Duffy and Darrin Mooney. Although    Gillespie and Beth go about their roles with characteristic self-seriousness, the songs have the sense of lightness that a side-project can bring. ""Remember We Were Lovers"" is a country-soul ballad that builds into a cosmic, horn-fuelled epic. ""You Can Trust Me Now"" is a nicely judged country-rock weepie. ""Your Heart Will Always Be Broken"" is a Rolling Stones-style pianorocker, a customary lodestar for Primal Scream. ""English Town"" has the handsome gloom of a 1960s Scott Walker song, with a touch of the chanson tradition of Beth's native France. The overall storyline of the collapsing marriage doesn't register strongly. Gillespie and Beth, unconnected romantically in real life, aren't convincing as a married duo. But notwithstanding its narrative gaps, Utopian Ashes makes for a diverting act of homage, solidly cast in the mould of bygone duet albums such as Golden Ring."
1b08485e8993415f2a49,2021-07-01,Will investors tolerate ESG reporting?,"Letters With reference to your article ""Watchdog turns up heat on climate reporting"" (Report, June 23) the everincreasing focus from impact investors on environmental, social and governance outcomes in companies is adding to corporate reporting burdens. The US CEO Forum in 2020 announced support of a wider stakeholder agenda, recently reinforced through a meeting with the G7 in Cornwall. How should boards respond? Should regulators look to more legislation to ensure uniformity on how these obligations are reported? To do so boards will be compelled to shift focus to a wider stakeholder agenda rather than the historic focus only on shareholder returns. It is more likely that following the fallout from the pandemic and the renewed focus on climate change, more legislation is on the way. But the investment community has yet to demonstrate in large numbers (and despite the funds flow into so called ESG investments) that it will tolerate short-term hits for longerterm stakeholder goals. Just ask Emmanuel Faber, Danone's former chief executive. Box ticking on ESG is not the way to go. Fundamental changes are needed at board level where the chair must have the requisite experience and integrity to ensure the goals are embedded in the purpose and values of the corporation. Together with independent directors who have the experience and determination to assist in ensuring that corporates ""walk the talk"" on these issues, this will go a long way to driving the right behaviours, reporting and effectiveness.

In particular, she neatly dissects the grumblings around valuation from fund managers. But while I would largely agree with her summary of private equity as ""a different corporate governance model, the success or not of which will depend [ ...] on the competence and creativity of the managers"", it is my view that she rather misses the point of this. Though its reputation has sadly not moved with it, the private equity industry has evolved significantly in the past decade from a model based on financial engineering towards value creation as the primary driver of growth at portfolio companies and ultimately therefore of returns to its investors. In doing so, it has been supported by a corporate governance regime that enables entrepreneurialism in its purest form the ""one shareholder, one vote"" framework that Somerset Webb refers to. During the same period, the setting of value-enhancing, long-term strategies at many listed companies has been overshadowed by the requirement to adhere to increasingly burdensome corporate governance codes and industry ""best practices"", a phenomenon I have christened ""governance correctness"". It is my belief that public markets have lost significant entrepreneurial ground to private markets, exacerbated by the short-termism of many public market investors. Somerset Webb's example of the Tesco shareholder resolution serves as a case in point. Shareholder actions, along with the box-ticking on environmental, social and governance requirements that come with a public listing these days, can have the unintended side effect of diluting a board's decision-making capabilities, thus stifling its entrepreneurial spirit. That's not to imply that private equity owners would disregard important stakeholder topics. In fact, I would argue private equity can be more effective albeit less noisy at shaping relevant ESG agendas. Steffen Meister Executive Chairman, Partners Group Baar-Zug, Switzerland"
f0247a3a2aca44413750,2021-06-29,Samsung's emissions cast cloud over ESG claims,"Samsung Electronics' rising carbon emissions and slow reduction of fossil fuel use is undermining the group's sustainability claims, according to environmentalists. The criticism comes as companies are under increasing scrutiny over climate change and concerns about greenwashing, whereby organisations overstate their environmental commitments and achievements. ""Everybody has ESG initiatives, everyone's talking ... but we don't see real tangible changes,"" said Youn Sejong, director of Solutions for Our Climate, a Seoul-based non-governmental organisation. Samsung is one of the biggest producers of computer chips, smartphones, electronic displays and appliances. The South Korean group has reported that its greenhouse gas emissions rose 5 per cent year on year in 2020. The company also relies on fossil fuels for more than 80 per cent of its electricity, according to Greenpeace, the environmental campaign group. The data have prompted questions over Samsung's climate change efforts despite the group touting claims that its sites in the US, Europe and China now use only renewable energy. Samsung declined to comment. The challenge facing Samsung is highlighted by South Korea and Vietnam, two of its biggest manufacturing bases, where energy systems rely on coal. Samsung has been pushing Seoul and Hanoi to speed up energy market deregulation aimed at inviting renewable energy investments. It wants to be able to buy power from independent renewable energy generators, bypassing stateowned energy groups. But activists said it could apply more pressure given its political clout. In South Korea and Vietnam, it is the single biggest corporate employer and contributor to gross domestic product. Further undermining the company's claims, Samsung affiliates along with units of carmaker Hyundai, Kepco and other South Korean companies have for years been at the forefront of coal power development in Vietnam. ""On one side they say they want more renewables for their electronics factory, and the other side, they're building this unnecessary coal power plant ... We all know that Samsung headquarters actually does co-ordinate between those decisions,"" Youn said."
e2b0bab786395d1dfcaf,2021-06-26,Do not blame private equity for fund managers missing out,"MARKETS Merryn Somerset Webb F und managers in the UK are a bit upset. US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice made a 230p per share offer last week for supermarket chain Wm Morrison. The board rejected the bid on the grounds that it ""significantly undervalued"" the firm. The market seemed to agree, pushing the share price of Morrisons up to 240p. You might ask what the problem is here. Morrisons was trading at 178p. Now it's trading at 233p. That ought to please most investors. Instead there is discontent, and it has two causes. The first is that not everyone considers private equity firms, with their reputation for asset stripping and financial engineering, to be good stewards of long-established companies. The second is that Clayton, Dubilier & Rice isn't offering enough for Morrisons. This first argument isn't entirely fair. While private equity often shows a tendency to over-leverage and underinvest, there is nothing intrinsically good or bad about private equity when it comes to management. It is just a different corporate governance model, the success or not of which will depend, as with listed companies, on the competence and creativity of the managers. If there is a problem, it is more one of transparency and participation. If private equity ends up owning the UK supermarket sector, the shelves will surely be as full as ever. But we may lose a say over what is on those shelves. In March ShareAction, a UK pressure group, forced Tesco to put a resolution to shareholders at its next annual meeting that would if passed require it to disclose targets and progress around encouraging shoppers to opt for fewer fatty, salty and sugary foods. You might disapprove of this, or not. There are upsides, including perhaps less obesity, and downsides, insofar as less processed food sold might mean lower margins. The essential point is that shareholders can make a difference on matters of this kind, and not only at AGMs. After the forcing of the resolution, Tesco pledged to aim to lift the proportion of ""healthy products"" it sells to 65 per cent of total sales by 2025. The more companies think votes will be used, the more they will react to them (this has been a record year for ESG resolutions at listed companies). Private equity might say they are the perfect shareholder democracy one shareholder, one vote. I'd say democracy works better when it's not an elite sport. On to the money. If 230p isn't enough to pay for Morrisons, you might ask why investors were perfectly happy to see it trading at 178p in the first place. Might it be that not enough traditional fund managers were holding many of the shares they now consider to have been much too cheap last week? Traditional fund managers like to think of themselves as a little contrarian or at least to tell everyone that's how they think of themselves. This is usually nonsense, something pretty firmly proven by not just the Morrison offer but others in the UK market this year. Private equity firms have now bid for 13 UK listed businesses since January 1. Why? Because that's where the value is, the value traditional fund managers have left on the table.    The private equity business is awash with cash. It's gone from strength to strength over the past decade thanks to the popular, but as yet unproven, belief that it offers better long-term returns than listed markets. By the beginning of this year McKinsey reckons the sector was worth about $7.3tn. It's an area conventional fund management companies have been clamouring to get into. Ask a fund manager what his plans are and odds are he'll say he intends to buy private companies because that's where the growth is. But it turns out that, while traditional fund managers have been eyeing up the cool growth stuff private equity is supposed to buy, private equity has begun to eye up the stuff the traditional fund managers are supposed to buy. With everyone wanting to be in the game, the multiples paid globally for private companies have hit all-time highs. But thanks to their workaday characteristics, those paid for listed UK companies have not. Before Morrisons announced the bid, its share price was down 9 per cent over a year. It's not the only neglected stock out there. Shares in the UK's big oil companies are 30 per cent or more below where they were when the oil price was last $70 a barrel in 2018. BT Group is down 47 per cent over the past five years which is probably why French billionaire Patrick Drahi stepped in to buy 12.1 per cent of it. Traditional fund managers are culpable. They've been so busy agitating to get a piece of the stuff that has performed well in the past that, a few dedicated income funds aside, they've started missing obvious opportunities one being the cheapness of the UK market. You can argue that a company such as Morrisons is worth more under private equity owners than on the listed market simply because the former can do clever things such as sale and lease back the firm's shops. But there is no reason why ordinary fund managers can't push for the same measures. If they did their jobs right, there would be no cheap listed UK companies for private equity companies to snap up they would already have been bid up to something close to fair value. No wonder fund managers are upset. Merryn Somerset Webb is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek If there is a problem, it is more one of transparency and participation"
f8d53b73e68580777175,2021-06-26,VC companies target retail investors for funds,"INVESTING Savers given access to early investments but warned of risks JOSHUA OLIVER UK venture capital companies are inviting retail investors to back early-stage entrepreneurs, opening up part of the market that has been hard for private investors to access, but which also carries particular risks. Forward Partners, a venture capital company, will include retail investors in an initial public offering that it plans to launch in the coming weeks, raising £30m in new cash, according to people familiar with the company's plans. The London-based company will join listed venture capitalists Draper Esprit and Augmentum, which have also opened recent fundraising rounds to retail investors, alongside other backers, using the PrimaryBid platform. Interest in private assets categories such as venture capital has surged in recent years as the investment industry grapples with low returns in the public markets. The private capital industry has grown threefold in the past decade to $7.4tn, according to Morgan Stanley. Retail investors have typically had less access to these potentially lucrative opportunities. Venture funds have often been unlisted vehicles with high minimum investment hurdles and targeted at institutions and wealthy individuals. The trio of UK venture capital companies see their fundraisings as a step towards opening up the asset class, but some in the industry are concerned about the risks private investors will run in search of higher returns. ""Private markets are an exciting area which are usually impossible for normal investors to get a slice of the pie,"" said Alex Davies, founder of Wealth Club, an investment service that helps wealthy clients select private investments. ""That said, this is risky stuff. Many of the underlying businesses are relatively early stage, heavily loss making and illiquid."" Venture funds see opportunities in backing these young businesses, and argue that investing in a company with a large portfolio of start-ups helps to diversify the risk to investors of individual entrepreneurs failing to deliver. ""No one is pretending this is low-risk, low yield. This is something for you if you want an allocation to growth and have an appetite for risk,"" said Tim Levene, chief executive of Augmentum, who began his own career as an entrepreneur founding a juice bar and later helped launch online betting company Flutter. Augmentum was the first UK-listed venture capitalist to tap retail investors on Primary Bid last October, and is now raising a further £40m, including from private investors. ""We've really promoted actively, bringing in more retail,"" said Levene. Forward Partners will also use PrimaryBid to include retail investors in its planned IPO, targeting a £125m valuation. Founded in 2013, the venture firm is backed by Black- Rock, the US investment house. Fund managers argue that going public gives them more flexibility and access to longerterm capital compared to standard VC fund structures that tie up investors' money for a fixed period subject to a set of conditions.    More companies have started to include retail investors in public offerings, as a way to attract attention, build loyalty or to engage with ""stakeholders"" as part of their agenda on environmental social and governance (ESG) issues. However, the leading example to date turned into a cautionary tale as 70,000 Deliveroo customers who participated in its April IPO were burnt as the share price dropped. The push to open new opportunities for retail investors comes after a review of London markets by former EU commissioner Lord Jonathan Hill recommended measures to encourage private investors to participate in IPOs. The UK government has long been keen to encourage investors to fund British tech start-ups. Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs), a class of listed investment trusts specialising in VC, enjoy income tax relief but are limited in the investments they can make. Some longtime investors still doubt the UK's ability to incubate winning businesses. Baillie Gifford fund manager James Anderson, known for his bold bets on companies such as Tesla and Amazon, told the FT that a ""deep sickness"" in UK capital markets has stifled the success of homegrown entrepreneurs. The Scottish Mortgage manager was an early advocate of investing in private companies with high growth potential to capture the full scale of their returns. Martin Davis, Draper Esprit's chief executive, said companies were tending to remain private for longer, limiting the opportunities to invest in them via public markets. ""The traditional drive to go public to access deeper pools of capital is less of a priority,"" said Davis. Draper Esprit, which raised a total of £111m last week, said the retail portion of its fundraising was 40 per cent oversubscribed. Draper itself is an investor in the PrimaryBid platform.

16d465e71ac5451ef883,2021-06-26,Investors face maze of choices in picking a wealth manager,"Wealth managers may have come through the worst of the pandemic, but they face issues on several fronts, from fees to adopting digital technology, writes Stefan Wagstyl At the start of the pandemic, Britain's wealth managers assumed they would be in for a torrid time, as financial markets crashed and worried clients swamped the phone lines. Instead, despite the human and economic damage wrought by the crisis, they are emerging from the depths of Covid-19 with their businesses secure and their prospects much brighter than expected. ""When things got really sticky in the market, clients just wanted somebody to talk to,"" says Rob Burgeman, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, an old, established Londonbased company. ""And that plays to the strengths that a lot of firms in our industry have."" The rapid recovery in stock markets from their March 2020 lows has transformed investors' fortunes and with them, the value of the assets under management (AUM) entrusted to wealth managers. While many do-it-yourself investors panicked and sold up, those with professional advisers generally stayed invested through the storm. Although millions of poorer people lost their jobs and ate into their savings, the well-off largely retained their income, whether from work, pensions or investments, and saw deposits soar as lockdown hit spending on leisure and travel. Also, many investors responded to the collective encounter with mortality by reorganising retirement and legacy plans generating another fee bonus for the wealth industry as well as creating opportunities to sign up a new generation of clients. ""With the pandemic there is more focus on financial planning than ever before,"" says Charlotte Ransom, chief executive and founder of Netwealth, a tech-based wealth manager. ""Portfolios are at record levels. And people are taking action, especially over pensions. The outlook for the business is very positive."" But, while the industry appears to have dodged the worst of Covid, the future is far from settled. Clients consistently complain about fees, putting pressure on revenues just as competition is increasing from tech-based newcomers and from retail banks refocusing their attention on wealth management. For established firms and new entrants alike, the adoption of digital technology, accelerated by the pandemic, is adding to the day-today challenges. For investors, the plethora of information and advertising on the web means it's never been easier to look for a wealth manager. But making a choice remains hard: despite recent improvements in transparency, many investors still struggle to compare fees, investment performance and quality of service. ""Wealth managers have talked about being client-led for years. Now they have the chance and the imperative to deliver on it,"" says Anna Zakrzewski, global head of wealth management at BCG, the consultancy, in an annual report on the sector. To help readers navigate these waters, FT Money looks at UK wealth companies, focusing on firms offering discretionary management via personal advisers. Together with Savanta, a research company, we are publishing a list of top wealth managers, with detailed company information (see following pages).    The core market is for savers with £250,000 to £5m to invest, though many firms have clients with substantially larger portfolios. Above £5m, private banks, including Swiss lenders with UK hubs, become increasingly competitive. Below £250,000 it becomes progressively harder to provide personal advice cost effectively. But tech is helping cut costs at this end of the market through the launch of semiautomated services, which compete with tech-based robo-advisers, such as Nutmeg, with very limited human support. The overall number of firms providing retail investment services a broad category including discretionary wealth management has risen slightly in recent years from 4,864 in 2015 to 5,111 in 2019, according to the Financial Conduct Authority, the regulator. Small firms those with five advisers or fewer account for about 90 per cent of the total. However, within this seemingly stable market, bigger companies are consolidating their grip, with the number of companies with more than 50 advisers almost doubling to 42 in 2015-19 and increasing their adviser count from 8,440 to 12,135, says the FCA. Leigh Himsworth, a fund manager at Fidelity International, who invests in wealth management companies and previously worked for 25 years in the sector, says the costs of technology including investment platforms and processing systems combined with growing regulatory burdens is driving consolidation. Also, the expansion of new financial products, such as funds based on private equity, requires recruiting bettertrained and higher-paid staff. In principle, these trends favour universal banks, with their big financial resources, including Barclays, Deutsche and HSBC. Nuno Matos, chief executive of wealth and personal banking at HSBC, says global banks offer not only international diversification of assets as do most wealth firms but also international diversification of location, so they are able to tap local knowledge all over the world. He says: ""Banks have a much bigger role to play in wealth management than in the past 10 years."" Also, many banks are seeking to expand their wealth management services, as they complete their recovery from the 2008-09 global financial crisis and try to supplement the poor returns earned from retail banking customers in the low-interest era. A notable recent example is Lloyds Bank's joint venture with Schroders, the fund management group. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank that has long given wealth advice to the ultra-wealthy, is pushing into lower market segments by adding a robo-advisory service to Marcus, its digital consumer bank. And JPMorgan Chase of the US this month ammounced plans to buy Nutmeg, the UK wealth management platform. Still, non-banks are not doomed to be outgunned by the big lenders. British banks have in the past been inconsistent with their commitment to wealth management, often struggling to fit this business into the wider sweep of retail services. Meanwhile, global private banks tend to focus more on their wealthiest clients than those with smaller portfolios. Is big necessarily better? Mark Le Lievre, a former banker at UBS, the Swiss bank, who has co-founded Vestrata, a company offering support services to wealth managers, says: ""The dirty little secret is that most wealth managers spend 80 per cent of the time on 20 per cent of their clients, and the other 80 per cent of clients are underserved. Most wealth managers are poor at engaging with clients."" In other words, big might not be best for all investors, especially those with smaller pots than the global rich. Himsworth says that specialist managers are ""perhaps better-placed"" to really get to know their customers than big banks. That's music to the ears of the likes of Paul Stockton, chief executive of Rathbones, a firm dating back to 1742. ""We bring a level of engagement and reassurance,"" he says. ""It's easy to present a cheap solution but it's hard to do what we do and take responsibility for managing our clients' money."" However, if tradition was ever decisive for investors choosing an adviser, it certainly isn't today. The pressure to deliver good financial returns on portfolios is relentless, as are demands to reduce fees. Digital technology has made it easier for clients to check results against benchmarks.    The rising markets of the past decade fuelled by tech stocks have been favourable for wealth managers, providing cover for even mediocre performers. It may be harder in coming years if the markets are less obliging. Interest rates remain low, but have crept up and are not expected to return to rock-bottom pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, inflation has re-emerged as a concern, as has the colossal increase in public debt. In a survey by Savanta, nine of 23 UK wealth managers who gave a view predicted that the FTSE 100 index (currently just over 7,000) would not hit 10,000 in the next five years. A further nine said it would do so only in 2025. The fees saga rumbles on If returns falter, clients are likely to revive longstanding complaints about fees. While transparency about charges has improved markedly after regulators ordered changes, customers are divided about whether the reforms have gone far enough. At Netwealth, Ransom says clients are ""growing less and less tolerant of expensive, out-of-date services"". Her company charges an all-in fee of 0.65 per cent a year of AUM, compared to what she says is a typical industry levy of 1.6 per cent. But traditional managers say this is not comparing like with like, since Netwealth is not based around human wealth managers, but an automated system offering limited portfolio choice. Also, Netwealth charges extra for some services such as pensions advice which some established firms wrap into their annual charges. Holly Mackay, chief executive of the Boring Money personal finance website, says 49 per cent of investors polled in a recent survey said they were content with paying charges as a percentage of AUM. That might not sound too bad. But a full 31 per cent want to switch to service-based fees, according to the Boring Money survey. ""These users want fixed fees for a fixed amount of advice,"" says Mackay. Andy McGlone, chief executive of Quilter Cheviot, the wealth management arm of investment group Quilter, says: ""The discretionary management industry has not been fast to adapt to client pressures over costs in comparison with other financial services."" As well as keen prices, investors want new services, especially advice on companies and funds meeting environmental social and governance (ESG) criteria. McGlone says it is easy to provide ESG-labelled products but the key is to standardise the information and embed it in the investing process. The firm plans to have a system for grading funds on ESG criteria ""by year end"". Boring Money's Mackay warns wealth managers that they have to be rigorous about ESG rules. ""There is a good deal of scepticism,"" she says. ""People want evidence and the wealth management industry isn't very good at providing evidence. There is still a lot of bluster."" Another tricky new field is private equity and other non-public markets. With private equity investments delivering big returns in recent years, they have become key to many institutional portfolios and important to very wealthy private investors. But private equity is not necessarily suitable for those with less than £1m in their portfolios, as these investments are illiquid, the minimum investment is often £100,000 or more and the fees are high in comparison with public market investments. Ed Smith, head of asset allocation at Rathbone, says: ""While it's appropriate for some of our most risk-tolerant clients to be in these markets, that's not true for most clients."" Looking to the future, wealth managers see the further advance of digital technology as central. With similar technology and the same range of investment products available to most wealth managers, companies have limited ways of differentiating themselves with their products. BCG's Zakrzewski says ""differentiation by delivery"" matters even more than before. That means providing good service, in person and online. This is particularly true in the face of competition from robo-advisers and the widespread use of digital platforms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown, where investors buy and sell on their own without advice. The rapid spread of do-it-yourself investing under lockdown has created new cohorts of investors, often young people, who are keen to make money and to learn more about markets. Some of those who have made speculative bets in cryptocurrencies or meme stocks are now looking to do more on their own. But others could turn into a new generation of clients for wealth managers. McGlone says: ""I think there will always be a market of people who don't want to do it themselves and will want an investment manager.""    'The dirty little secret is that most wealth managers spend 80 per cent of the time on 20 per cent of their clients, and the other 80 per cent of clients are underserved' MARK LE LIEVRE, FORMER UBS BANKER"
5e51611c525b053ddf3d,2021-06-26,BUY Financial services Liontrust (LIO) After [...],"BUY Financial services Liontrust (LIO) After a banner year for profits and client flows, the fund house remains confident of future growth To many investment commentators, 2020 was the year where so-called ESG (environment, social and governance) focused capitalism stamped its authority on markets. Latest figures for Liontrust Asset Management, which prided itself on a sustainable approach to investing long before the pandemic, bear this out. In the 12 months to March 31, the FTSE 250 firm saw a 69 per cent leap in adjusted pre-tax profits to £64.3m, due to a 30 per cent rise in net inflows. Those inflows powered a near-doubling in assets under management to £30.9bn at the end of the financial year. Numis analyst David McCann, who raised his target price on the stock to 1,900p following these results, nonetheless believes net flows will narrow to £2.9bn this year and £2.4bn in full-year 2023. By the end of that year, brokers think Liontrust's asset pile will stand at £42bn. That suggests something of a moderation compared with the recent rate of growth, though this still translates to strong double-digit growth in revenues, profits and dividends. While it is probably sensible for shareholders to rein in expectations after such a strong recent tailwind, the group's distribution strategy offers hope that earnings can continue their skyward trajectory. The acquisition of the UK business of multi-manager Architas, for £54m net of cash, points to a potential source of growth: as Liontrust's brand recognition grows, it should have an easier job of attracting talent in the fund management industry.

11acc829774c0739440c,2021-06-26,'Cryptocurrency isn't a canary',"Lunch with the FT Edward Bonham Carter He is a gently rebellious outsider of British finance. Over sashimi in Mayfair, the veteran fund manager talks to Patrick Jenkins about navigating today's hot markets, his famous family and why he thinks UK stocks are due for a bounce I freewheel down Half Moon Street, five minutes early for my lunch with Edward Bonham Carter (yes, Helena's his sister) and slightly surprised by the choice of venue. Bonham Carter, who is stepping down from the board of Jupiter Asset Management after more than 20 years with the group, has suggested a Japanese restaurant, Kiku, in the heart of Mayfair. Having secured my bike, I look up to see a stylishly disheveled figure (pale green chinos, blue sweater, orange neckerchief, Allbirds ""comfort"" shoes) pause at the door, don a face mask and enter. This is a favoured haunt of the hedge fund set and that's not Bonham Carter, who is half financial establishment, yes, but as his attire suggests is also a gently rebellious outsider. Kiku, in Japanese, means to ask or listen. What a neat choice for an interview, I think, but in the first 20 minutes it is Bonham Carter who is asking all the questions and doing all the listening about my family, the reasons for my longstanding vegetarianism, an imminent house move, how I've stayed fit during lockdown, my view on the recently departed boss of a big bank. ""Stupid boy, Pike,"" Bonham Carter suddenly snaps at himself, echoing a catchphrase from 1970s TV comedy Dad's Army. On this occasion the cause of the self-chastisement is forgetting that banker's name. But it is a trademark verbal tic that encapsulates the 61-yearold: witty, self-deprecating and ever so slightly stuck in the past. You could point to a certain nostalgia in his career, too: he has stuck with Jupiter from the company's infancy through to its middle age and led it through its golden years. Today it commands £59bn of assets under management, having doubled in a decade. Like most active stockpicking managers that charge high fees, it has struggled in recent years to compete with cheap passive funds that track indices automatically. Bonham Carter has himself moved with the times, though, to focus increasingly on the booming business of ESG investing. I'm hoping that as a City veteran, he will enlighten me on everything from the post-Brexit Square Mile to the sustainability of the crypto boom. Minutes after our arrival he's retelling another favourite joke: had his mother not smoked during pregnancy, he would have been a star basketball player and not a 5ft 3in financier. The wry delivery follows right after he's told me of a family tragedy, and right before he expostulates on short-termist investment horizons and the inadequacies of the climate agenda. That is the other thing about Bonham Carter: this is actually a very serious man but one who doesn't take himself too seriously.    The waitress swoops in to take our order. Pure vegetarian options are limited pragmatically I accept a fish-stock miso soup, followed by vegetable tempura and boiled rice. Bonham Carter, who describes himself as a ""flexitarian"", opts for a three-fish sashimi. (""Yellowtail?"" the waitress predicts, reflecting just how much of a regular Bonham Carter is at Kiku, plus mackerel and sea bass.) ""Do you want a beer?"" Bonham Carter asks, a welcome suggestion given the warm day and hot restaurant. Bonham Carter has spent much of the past year holed up at his second home on the edge of the South Downs in West Sussex. This is not the high-spec mansion you might expect of a City bigwig: ""It's an old cottage. The electrics need updating. The plumbing needs updating. The floorboards need taking out. It's got a charming decrepitude."" He and his family have rented it for the past 20 years as a getaway from their London home in Barnes. And then he's off on one of his many conversational tangents, dipping into the political realm and arguing that people's homes should not be ""a financial asset to speculate on"". He veers into tax policy, as usual citing a relevant intellectual (in this case Jean-Baptiste Colbert and his famous comment that ""the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing""). Bonham Carter advocates ""more redistribution"" as part of a gradual trend towards rebalancing economies away from short-termist winnertake-all forms of capitalism. As a student, he says, he was drawn to Marx ""and the theory that the capitalist system has the roots of its own destruction inbuilt and also it's based on an extraction of value"". Though he acknowledges the practical challenges of using the tax system to redistribute property wealth, given the risks of arbitraging, he says: ""Personally I think there's a case for a property tax, a wealth tax, a land tax, something."" B onham Carter has long operated in the big-ego environment of the City of London and has occupied a social circle bordering the upper middle class, the aristocracy and, thanks to his sister, the glitterati. He is disarmingly straightforward about his family, describing how, as soon as lockdown easing allowed, he began returning to London to visit his elderly mother in Golders Green. At 86 and with terminal lung cancer, she is still a practising psychotherapist with a few clients on her books. He marvels at her resilience and then segues into a heart-wrenching tale of his father's transformation from 1970s City high-flyer and fitness obsessive (""cold baths every morning, early morning runner"") to quadriplegic. ""He had an acoustic neuroma, which is a tumour on the hearing nerve, and it had to be removed and complications of the operation meant that he woke up in intensive care ... He was in hospital and various rehabilitation centres for 18 months before he came home and he was effectively a quadriplegic ... He had some use of his hands, he was in a wheelchair, incontinent, impotent sorry to be brutal but that's descriptive rather than being brutal. He lost his peripheral vision. His writing co-ordination was like a nine-year-old's."" Bonham Carter sips at the salty soup that has just arrived. ""So that was a lesson in lockdown."" Bonham Carter was 19 at the time, and just heading off to Manchester University, while his brother was at Harrow ""and my sister was still at home, at South Hampstead High School"". I try to lighten the mood: ""What's her name again?"" ""Daphne,"" he shoots back with a smirk. He references ""my sister"" half a dozen times more over lunch, with a mix of low-key pride and affection, though never by name: it is the one aspect of his family life on which, one suspects out of respect for her privacy, he is circumspect. But as I relish the crispy coating and perfectly cooked innards of my tempura and Bonham Carter expertly chopsticks his sashimi, he needs only a small prompt to take the family story back another two generations, to his star ancestor, former prime minister HH Asquith. What would his great-grandfather have made of the current inhabitant of Number 10 Downing Street? ""Well, like Boris, he was a classicist, so I think he would have approved of that. They both have a weakness for the fairer sex. They're both good with words."" He pauses. ""Then I'm finding it hard to find similarities."" As we skewer the last grains in our small rice bowls, we finally settle on Bonham Carter's day job. He began his career in 1982 at Schroders as an administrative assistant. Drawn by the excitement of markets and wanting to understand everything that drives them, he specialised in asset management, switched to Jupiter and built along career there, rising to chief executive and then into an executive vice-chair role via a bold private equity buyout.    Bonham Carter has just moved into a part-time job advising on the ever-expanding realm of ESG investing via funds that prioritise environmental, social and governance issues. He is an intellectual environmentalist, his interest in the topic sparked by pragmatic curiosity rather than a pure passion for the cause. As on half a dozen occasions during our lunch, he cites books that are relevant to the subject at hand in this case, Bill Gates's How to Avoid a Climate Disaster and Our Final Century by Astronomer Royal Martin Rees. And as on other topics, from Covid to the personal challenges of seeing his father's sudden disability, he maintains a resolutely upbeat attitude, what he calls his ""muddlethrough theory"". We should approach climate change like an insurance underwriter, he says: ""You know there's a possibility your house might burn down consequence severe, likelihood hopefully unlikely and therefore it's rational for you to pay a small premium if only to sleep comfortably at night."" The Covid crisis has created a precedent for vast pre-emptive spending, he says. ""Maybe we should think about climate change to that extent: a combination of mitigation and spending some precautionary money."" But even on the biggest questions, Bonham Carter doesn't dally long. He bridges to another pet topic: shorttermism. First, he worries that the ""massive experiment, with no control experiment"", of the past decade's monetary policy is mortgaging the future of the next generation. He frets that they will lose out through a move to remote working that will rob them of the chance to build the ""social capital"" needed for a career. The stream of consciousness shifts to retirement prospects, where ""clearly the numbers don't add up [and] you need some kind of total rejig"". And then he wraps it all together once again with a political bent. ""All this stuff education systems, healthcare systems, pensions needs good long-term thinking, some sort of cross-party agreement that says whatever saplings of reform you sow aren't then ripped up by your successor."" B onham Carter's core business of investment management is also in the middle of a debate about short-term versus longterm thinking. He says he welcomes the growing fashion to talk less of myopic ""shareholder value"" and more of a broader ""stakeholder value"", encompassing the interests of customers, staff and society, which over the longer term should be more sustainably positive for investors, too. The whistle-stop brain-sharing is giving Bonham Carter a thirst. ""May we have some more green tea?"" Bonham Carter asks a passing waitress for perhaps the fifth time. What, then, does he think of the extreme volatility in markets, driven in large part by private investors punting for short-term gain? The fashion for Spacs the emptyshell special-purpose acquisition companies that make it easier for private companies to float, with fat margins for sponsors he deems ""a collection of canaries flying around a coal mine shaft. It just makes me nervous. It echoes a South Sea Bubble company formed for no specific purpose."" Cryptocurrency, by contrast, ""isn't a canary"", he argues. ""It's a reflection on a number of things. Speculation is one of them, but not the only thing. I think it's an increasing distrust about faith-based monetary systems."" In short, he understands why many people are no longer in thrall to governments, central banks and fiat money. So how is he investing his own money these days? He insists UK equities are relatively cheap ""not because I'm a particular optimist about the playout of Brexit or Covid, but it has underper- formed as an economy for a very long time and I think it's due a bounce"". He admits, though, to being underinvested in today's hot markets. ""I've got a bit more cash than I normally have because I'm an out-of-fashion value investor."" He remains a big shareholder in Jupiter, after a career with the firm, though he has ""sold a bit"". Like many midsized active asset managers, Jupiter has struggled in recent years as private investors have flocked away from relatively expensive active funds. Bonham Carter's career has followed that trend in January he took on the chairmanship of Netwealth, the online wealth manager that channels clients' money largely into passive funds and invests heavily in the business, too. Two other non-executive directorships are at companies ITV and Land Securities, one of the UK's largest commercial landlords that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. Land Securities, he insists, will adapt to the ongoing uncertainty about office and retail space. ""My personal view is [offices] are going to need redesign and repurposing to be more flexible, and all the rest of it. But humans will still want to, by and large, work with other humans in proximity.""    At ITV, shaken by last year's plunge in advertising revenue, the question he says is whether the broadcaster's strategic bets will pay off when the next generation is more likely to be glued to YouTube or TikTok than Coronation Street. ""Like a lot of businesses, it's got some significant challenges,"" is his tactful conclusion. The restaurant has emptied and staff are beginning to clear up around us an effective prompt to leave. As Bonham Carter prepares to walk back to Jupiter headquarters in Victoria, and I hop on my bike back to the City, he expresses polite praise for my Giant hybrid, but clearly it's not a match for his high-end Pearson Flat Iron or even less the new electric mountain bike given to him by Jupiter to aid his semi-retirement rides through the South Downs. A week later we unexpectedly meet again at the Bounce bar near Chancery Lane Tube to indulge in a game of postlockdown table tennis: a mutual friend has gathered a small group of enthusiasts together, including improbably Bonham Carter. Of all the City figures I've ever met, the one who is the great-grandson of a prime minister and brother of a Hollywood film star is perhaps the most affable, and certainly the least grand. He still makes sure to excel, roundly beating the rest of the company although along the way, an uncharacteristic forehand into the net elicits a familiar cry: ""Stupid boy, Pike.""

To that end, they seem tempted to use certain types of powers that they have as prudential regulators. There is a clear difference between being appropriately mindful, and turning into an outright regulator, of the green policies that businesses should be implementing to meet their environmental, social and governance responsibilities. Financial regulators should no doubt do the first, but forget about the other at this time. As virtuous as climate risk management concerns may be, they remain largely incidental to the basic vocation of financial regulators regarding the stability of financial systems or the protection of investors. Trying to corollate the two in the context of a Climate Change Conference love-in is more ideology than effective action. Central bankers should not lose sight that all sectors of the legal economy deserve access to the services of banks and capital markets. They also deserve the protection associated to their management of systemic risk, equally and without discrimination against any group of legitimate stakeholders, whether they be high or low carbon generators or even if their production is not green enough in the eyes of the buyside activists.

044e40e6be4df7b5f9ad,2021-06-24,ESG shift fuels collaboration and generates new work,"Green economy Environmental push is spurring changes in the way attorneys perform their jobs, writes Sarah Murray As climate change, loss of biodiversity and resource scarcity rise up the corporate agenda, the innovations needed to address these problems are generating more work for patent firms ? and changing the way attorneys do their jobs. The past decade has seen a rise in the filing of patents related to environmental goals, such as net-zero carbon emissions ? particularly in the energy sector ? driven by an emergent green economy and a flow of funds into environmental, social and governance (ESG) focused investments. In renewable energy, the number of international patents filed in 2019 was 3.5 times higher than in 2002, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. Most of this growth occurred between 2002 and 2012 ? a decade in which patent numbers rose 547 per cent. Similar patterns have been seen in the patents filed through the UK Intellectual Property Office Green Channel, which can speed up patent applications for inventions with environmental benefits. In 2019, these applications reached 286, double the 137 received in 2009. Colin Baker says demand for technologies that address challenges such as climate change are increasing the workload at Nottingham-based law firm Potter Clarkson, where he is a partner. He reports a greater focus from clients on innovations in renewable energy. ""We're noticing more work coming through in the electrical energy generation sphere,"" he says. ""There's a lot more interest in battery technology, as well as renewable energy ? things like solar, wave, biofuels and wind turbines."" Battery technology and hydrogen power are two subsectors that Juan Arias highlights as providing more work for Spain's ABG Intellectual Property, where he is managing partner. And while the firm's cases related to battery technology have been increasing over the past five years, he says those related to hydrogen power have emerged in the past few months. ""Hydrogen is a very hot topic right now,"" he says. ""We are working with at least three big companies on this."" This demand for solutions to tackle climate change is not only increasing the volume of work for patent attorneys, it is also changing the way they do their jobs. Most notably, the new technologies require attorneys to work across disciplines, encouraging more collaboration between the different practices in patent law firms. ""It's most definitely led to changes in the way we work,"" says Clarkson, citing the example of batteries. ""A lot of the technology in developing batteries will be traditional chemistry. But when you come to the battery management system, that's a software issue ? so having multidisciplinary teams is important.""    A similar shift is happening in academia, says Estelle Derclaye, professor of intellectual property law at the School of Law at University of Nottingham. ""You have new sectors emerging where, for example, chemistry is crossing with biotech to make compounds more recyclable,"" she says. ""In universities, this cross-disciplinary research and collaboration is encouraged so that people talk to each other rather than working in silos."" In an industry whose firms are traditionally structured around specialist areas, this means taking steps to encourage collaboration. To do this, ABG runs internal seminars ? conducted remotely during the pandemic ? where presentations are made of cases that have required interdisciplinary approaches. ABG also links year-end bonuses to collaboration and, in rewarding staff, it prioritises work in meeting the firm's overall goals over individual performance. ""We track who works with whom,"" says Arias. ""It's a bit more complicated than before, but we're taking measures to avoid competition between departments."" The relative success of internal collaboration depends partly on a firm's culture, says Sophie Ertl, a partner from the engineering team at Maiwald, one of Germany's largest intellectual property firms. ""It changes the structure of a law firm,"" she says. ""In former times, a partner was a kind of king in a kingdom. Now we are a team and we can't fight over clients ? we have to work together."" A need to combine many disciplines when handling patents for environmental innovations means scale can be a plus point for a firm, reckons Eva Dôrner, a partner from Maiwald's life sciences team. Even though the patent law sector contains many boutique firms, larger practices can win business. ""When you have a certain size, it means you have expertise from all fields,"" she explains. ""For our firm, it's certainly an advantage that we have so many differently specialised attorneys ? it's good to have everything under one roof."" ABG links bonuses with collaboration, prioritising the firm's goals over individual performance"
49fb0008cc0dd91456d0,2021-06-23,Platinum: catalyst convert,"Twitter: @FTLex Precious metals and cryptocurrencies have a lot in common. Both are championed by groups who question the integrity of global monetary systems. Both are known for their limited supply and regarded as an alternative store of value. Both get bad press for their environmental impact. Platinum's contribution to climate change may seem odd given the metal helps to clean up dirty car exhaust fumes. But demand relies on the continued production of internal combustion cars that use fossil fuels. Automotive catalysts make up about a third of platinum and almost all of palladium consumption. A future of climate-friendly electric vehicles is bad news for suppliers. This remains some way off. Plenty of new cars still require their fumes cleansed of polluting elements such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. Platinum prices doubled in the year to March as traders anticipated a rebound in auto sales. No surprise then that shares in UKlisted Johnson Matthey, one of the world's largest makers of catalytic converters, have rallied by half in the past 12 months. But platinum's rally has faded since the spring. Rival metal palladium is preferred by automakers for use in petrol emission catalysts. Supply concerns have helped to lift palladium prices. Demand has outpaced global supply by an annual average of 611,000 troy ounces in the four years to the end of 2020, according to Johnson Matthey. Automakers cannot easily switch input materials, even if palladium trades at well over double platinum's $1,064 per troy ounce value. Like cryptocurrencies, platinum and palladium are both dogged by longterm ESG issues. The metals are predominantly mined in South Africa, where mines are often dangerously hot and deep, making safety a paramount issue. While crypto may find alternative sources to power its mining, platinum and palladium will struggle to find a replacement for consumption that can match automotive catalysts."
c4843ea89eda88b84bc7,2021-06-22,Private equity 'raid' on UK plc sparks fury in City of London,"Traditional fund managers speak out against takeovers they say undervalue businesses An attempt by private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to take over the supermarket chain Wm Morrison would, if successful, mark one of Britain's biggest leveraged buyouts since the 2008 crisis. It would cap a frenzied six-month period in which private equity dealmakers have announced bids for UK-listed companies at the fastest pace in more than two decades, triggering a fierce row in the City of London. The push from the buyouts industry pits traditional fund managers, who have started to take the rare step of speaking out against takeovers, against bullish dealmakers sitting on recordsized pots of cash, who claim that some of the objections are unreasonable. Britain's boards are caught in the middle, treading a fine line between the two groups at a time when many companies' operations have been disrupted by Brexit and the pandemic, making it harder to agree on a fair valuation. ""There is a private equity raid right now"" on UK companies, said James Henderson, a fund manager at Janus Henderson. Rupert Krefting, head of corporate finance and stewardship at M&G, said buyout groups were ""acquiring publicly listed companies far too cheaply,"" in deals that ""fail to compensate [shareholders] adequately"". CD&R is expected to push ahead with its bid for Morrisons this week despite its £8.7bn offer being rejected and criticism from top 10 shareholder Legal and General Investment Management. Morrisons, which was this year relegated from the FTSE 100, is one of 13 listed businesses that private equity firms have put into play since the start of the year, the highest figure since 1999. There were just four in the same period last year and three in 2019, figures from Refinitiv show. Private equity bids for UK-listed companies have amounted to £21bn this year, according to Refinitiv. Firms have made 345 bids for British companies altogether including those that are already privately owned the highest number since records began in 1984. For buyout firms, there is an ideal combination of cheap debt and interest in alternative investing, giving them access to large amounts of cash. At the same time, the UK's stock market has struggled to recover from the Brexit vote, and took a further big hit during last year's pandemic sell-off, depressing valuations and creating an opportunity for buyout groups. But some fund managers are concerned that boards are approving deals too cheaply. They worry about how the shift from public to private equity ownership could affect jobs, pensions, public services and companies' futures. US buyout firm Blackstone's £1.2bn offer for St Modwen, a property company involved in the redevelopment of New Covent Garden Market that has been a steady stock market presence for more than three decades, is one example of the intensifying battle.    Henderson said he had spoken to the company's board about his concerns with the deal, which shareholders are due to vote on next month. ""The premium isn't enough,"" he said. Janus Henderson, a top 10 investor in St Modwen, has sold about a third of its shareholding in recent weeks, filings show, but one person close to the matter said this was unrelated to the deal. JO Hambro, one of St Modwen's biggest investors, also said it opposed the Blackstone bid, while M&G Investments and Allianz Global Investors last month blasted plans to sell FTSE 250-listed UDG Healthcare to CD&R. Schroders in May criticised transport operator First- Group's sale of its US business to Swedish buyout group EQT. Infrastructure investor John Laing, power supplier Aggreko, car breakdown service AA, and debt collector Arrow Global are among the UK-listed companies to have agreed private equity deals in the past year. Senior, the FTSE 250 aerospace and defence group, is being targeted by US group Lone Star, which yesterday sweetened its offer after an initial approach was roundly rejected. Richard Marwood, an investment manager at Royal London Asset Management, said the departure of public businesses, particularly specialist companies such as Signature Aviation, could leave the UK market less attractive. ""The question is whether the businesses we are gaining [through IPOs] are better than the ones we are losing. That has yet to be proven."" Krefting said the increase in buyout attempts was ""a bad outcome for shareholders, particularly as these private equity firms also benefit from leverage, tax benefits and lower requirements for financial, environmental, social and governance disclosure"". Private equity firms have faced criticism that the cost-cutting model they sometimes use reduces service quality and investment, particularly in crucial public sectors such as water, elderly care and children's homes. Nick Hood, analyst at Opus Restructuring and Insolvency, said there was a danger ""when a risky finance model is applied to an industry that provides a vital service"". Private equity lobby group, the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, said many of its members were ""aiming to provide greater scrutiny and better reporting of [ESG] outcomes than the listed markets."" The BVCA said private equity ""brings value and long-term support to the businesses it invests in and creates jobs up and down the country"". It said there was no obligation on boards to accept an offer. Still, private equity executives are growing frustrated with shareholders' resistance. ""If you think these shares are worth a lot more, why weren't you buying a lot more of them?"" said one senior figure at a buyout group. ""You're sitting there doing nothing, and if somebody offers you a price for your shares, which other shareholders are willing to accept, you complain."" Piers Prichard Jones, co-head of law firm Freshfields' M&A practice in London, argued that boards were ""driving a hard bargain"" with private equity bidders. ""There are a lot of bids being rejected at the moment in private, and shareholders just don't see that. It's harder now than it has been since the financial crisis to assess what a fair value is for a lot of companies."" FTSE 250-listed fund services group Sanne rejected four approaches from Cinven before agreeing to talks this month over a potential £1.4bn takeover. Alongside private equity's push to take companies private, there has been a surge in the number of companies going public. This year 31 companies have listed in the UK, raising $11.8bn, up from four in the same period last year and 11 in 2019, Refinitiv figures showed. Private equity executives typically avoid challenging boards with hostile takeover bids. But some are privately wondering if such tactics may make a comeback, as they face pressure to deploy funds. ""It's certainly more of a topic for discussion than it has been previously,"" Prichard Jones said. Even so, they might struggle to win over shareholders, who ""aren't rolling over"" on low offers, said James Thorne, a fund manager at Columbia Threadneedle.    Henderson said he believed investors would ""fight harder on price"" as it became harder to find new stocks to replace those taken private. ""It will become tougher for private equity."" 'The question is whether the businesses we are gaining are better than the ones we are losing'"
1b4d33b0a274f74dac51,2021-06-22,Key to ESG investment success is communication,"Letters Helen Thomas is correct to highlight the increasing depersonalisation, some might say commoditisation, of investment management as a risk to the effectiveness of ESG investing (""Cumming's exit from Aviva shows demise of fund management star culture"", June 18). Asset managers are now having to take ESG seriously because, at long last, their clients and customers are expecting, in some cases, demanding, them to do so. If the industry's response is to greenwash via screening and exclusion only it will perpetuate its reputation as a poor fiduciary of clients' assets. The key to making ESG investing effective, and capital markets efficient, is engagement between investors and companies' management. ""Star"" fund managers are certainly not required for this, but stock selectors who take their roles as stewards of other people's capital seriously and are prepared to represent their clients' interests to sophisticated corporate managers are a pre-requisite. Human, rather than artificial, intelligence and intervention will still be required. Robin Hindle Fisher Sloan Fellow, London Business School London NW1, UK"
9de273be3ba8ecee21f5,2021-06-22,Investors want environmental risk disclosure to improve,"Climate targets Amazon, Facebook, Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway are failing to report data on climate change to their shareholders, according to a coalition of heavyweight investors, which is demanding that 1,320 companies should make clearer disclosures about environmental risks. Fears that climate change will result in catastrophic environmental damage are fuelling demands by institutional investors and regulators for companies to accelerate their efforts to reach the goal of a net zero carbon emissions economy. Ahead of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow scheduled for November, 168 asset managers and financial institutions from 28 countries, which together represent more than $17tn in combined assets, have signed up to support the Carbon Disclosure Project's campaign to ensure that data on climate change, deforestation and water usage are properly reported by companies. More than 4,700 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to be produced by the 1,320 targeted companies, more than the entire EU, according to CDP. Emily Kreps, global director of capital markets at CDP, said the tide was turning against companies that were not responding to investor demands for better disclosures of environmental risks. ""This year's campaign against nondisclosure has achieved record levels of support with a 56 per cent increase in investor participation. Investors require data that is consistent, comparable and comprehensive to help them to meet their own net-zero ambitions,"" said Kreps. US regulators are engaged in a fierce debate over whether to impose formal disclosure requirements for environmental, social and governance metrics on US companies. Amazon and Facebook signed a letter this month to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that they supported ""regular and consistent reporting of climate-related matters"" while also urging the US regulator to allow ESG data to be published separately from company main financial reports to avoid possible legal problems. ""Mandatory ESG disclosure is an essential planning tool that can help to establish regulatory certainty and a level playing field,"" said Paula DiPerna, special adviser to CDP North America. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer, Chipotle Mexican Grill, the US burrito chain, and the US homebuilder Lennar are among 73 laggards that provide inadequate disclosures on all three of the environmental topics highlighted by CDP. Demands for improved disclosures have also been directed to 122 Chinese companies including ecommerce group Alibaba, Kweichow Moutai, the distiller and Meituan Dianping, China's biggest food delivery app. Environmental disclosure standards are showing signs of improvement as a result of pressure from large investors. The campaign co-ordinated last year by CDP led to 206 companies responding to disclosure requests by investors, up from 97 in 2019.

4ec7e4ade57ddfdcf6ab,2021-06-21,Microsoft and Alphabet take issue with SEC plans on ESG,"? Tech groups reject formal filing idea ? Stance at odds with asset managers Microsoft and Alphabet have argued against calls to include disclosures on environmental, social and governance issues in key US regulatory filings, setting them on course for a tussle with big asset managers. The tech companies told the top US securities watchdog that ESG information should not be included in a type of filing known as a 10k, which most public groups must submit every year. Microsoft and Alphabet said including ESG information in these filings would open them to potential legal risks since such data are subject to more uncertainty than the detailed financials and risk disclosures that are currently required in 10ks. The duo's submission in recent days to the Securities and Exchange Commission sets up a clash with Pimco, Invesco and other large asset managers that want ESG information to be included in 10ks. The SEC is planning to make the disclosures mandatory and is considering where they should be included. Josh Zinner, chief executive of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which includes religious organisations and other ESG-minded investors, said such disclosures would create a ""more level playing field and highlight these companies' leadership"". Microsoft and Alphabet, Zinner said, ""position themselves as sustainability leaders and they should certainly be supportive of mandatory disclosure on ESG matters, including in their regulatory filings, where they would be accountable for the content of this information"". The battle over ESG disclosure is expected to intensify. With global warming and human rights posing new risks for companies, the SEC has embarked on unprecedented disclosure rulemaking for the booming ESG sector. In 2021, almost a third of global equity inflows have gone into ESG funds, Bank of America said in a June 1 report. Assets under management in ESG funds hit a record $1.4tn in April, more than double the level from a year ago and growing at nearly three times the rate of non-ESG assets, the bank said. Microsoft and Alphabet have benefited from this surge. Microsoft is the most widely held company in US ESG funds, Bank of America said. Google parent Alphabet is among the top 10 most popular ESG companies and is held in almost half of all US ESG funds. Alphabet joined other technology companies in a letter to the SEC last week that recommended ESG disclosures ""be furnished via separate climate reporting to the SEC"". ""Given that climate disclosures rely on estimates and assumptions that involve inherent uncertainty, it is important not to subject companies to undue liability, including from private parties,"" the companies said. Microsoft said its SEC letter was not intended to imply that climate disclosures stay out of SEC filings entirely. It said its cycle for compiling and verifying climate data might not align with the year-end financial statements. While it will continue to provide ESG disclosures outside of SEC filings, Microsoft said ""we believe climate disclosures in SEC filings should be limited to information that is material to an investment or voting decision"".    Alphabet declined to comment. Microsoft and Alphabet ... 'should certainly be supportive of mandatory disclosure on ESG matters'"
fd32b6e0098cc18cccb1,2021-06-21,Amazon and PwC take to the trenches in the talent wars,"In the unduly bellicose jargon of the ""war for talent"", staff turnover is sometimes described, all too appropriately, as ""attrition"". The term covers a lot of the workplace's most emotional moments: angry resignations, well-deserved retirements, career-ending disabilities, sudden deaths, old-fashioned sackings and their weaselly modern equivalents, from down-sizings to ""demisings"". Influencing who stays, and for how long, and who goes, but also how they leave, is a critical and unending task. Take these recent tales of two strategies, at PwC and Amazon. Based on the categories popularised by the late Douglas McGregor, professional services firms practise Theory Y attrition management, cajoling self-motivated staff towards mutually beneficial goals, inside and even beyond the firm. Amazon models the more utilitarian Theory X, careless of its workers' loyalty, let alone their career after Amazon. PwC has just outlined plans to add 100,000 to its 284,000-strong global workforce in the next five years. That would be bold enough, even if the firm did not also have to offset the high attrition rate of Big Four accountants. The plan is not without risk. PwC wants to satisfy a voracious appetite for advice on environmental, social and governance matters (ESG). But ""for the profitability [of the firm] to make sense, you need the right number of people at each level for the kind of work that they're selling"", says Laura Empson, academic and author of Leading Professionals. Firms are sometimes left with a ""stodgy bloc"" of staff who were hired in good times for a specific need but then fail to progress or move on after the market turns. The Big Four manage attrition by sucking in young recruits, training them intensively, and managing their performance closely, while selling their services at a premium to clients. In exchange, these juniors receive the imprimatur of an international brand they can parlay into better paid jobs elsewhere. The big firms like to see themselves as leadership development machines in the same way Procter & Gamble and Unilever feed ambitious young ex-trainees into industry. Strategy consultancies such as McKinsey have further refined this model with an ""up or out"" system that nudges out staff who will not progress, then cultivates them as alumni. Amazon's expansion plans, supercharged by the need to respond to last year's exceptional jolt in demand for its services, are even more ambitious than PwC's. It has been hiring one person for every six or seven that apply for jobs in warehouses, according to one former Amazon data scientist quoted in the New York Times. Its attrition rate is similarly mind-boggling. The group was apparently turning over the equivalent of its entire workforce at least annually before the pandemic. At that rate, this former employee reckons, Amazon would need between 8m and 10m people to apply each year, just to hire enough to keep staff numbers steady. (Amazon has said focusing on attrition alone omits ""important context"". It declined to comment further.)    In his book Amazon Unbound, Brad Stone reports that founder Jeff Bezos once told David Niekerk, a senior human resources executive, ""if we ever appear in the '100 best places to work in America', you've screwed this place up"". Niekerk told the Times that Bezos deliberately limited the upward progress of warehouse workers because entrenching them would lead to ""a march to mediocrity"". The short-sightedness of that policy will be obvious if local shortages of labour make it hard for Amazon to hire enough staff. One option for Bezos is to edge towards a PwC-style Theory Y model, because improved staff loyalty and self-motivation should reduce the risk of uncontrolled attrition. Indeed, Bezos recently committed Amazon to become ""Earth's best employer"". He will soon be able to assess its progress towards that goal from space. The loyalty factor can be overstated. Amazon-style hourly work suits some people. Most white-collar workers aren't looking to work for one employer for decades. Both PwC and Amazon need many willing hands to build the foundations of their strategies. Both face similar dilemmas about how to retain the workers they need and shed those they don't. Critically, both operate in a volatile labour market. US Bureau of Labor Statistics show the number of ""quits"" or voluntary departures from jobs shrank sharply in March and April last year, as people clung to paid work during the crisis, but had returned to pre-Covid levels by the end of 2020. One recent poll suggests more than a fifth of knowledge workers are likely or very likely to look for jobs elsewhere in the next 12 months. Amazon warehouses may not be their first choice, but given the group's expansion and attrition management, there will always be a vacancy. andrew.hill@ft.com ' Amazon would need between 8m and 10m people to apply each year, just to keep its staff numbers steady '"
c60cd3484610aa1cb7a6,2021-06-21,Judged: the best sustainable finance courses,"Awards Strong content and teaching in this year's Financial Times/ ISFFC excellence award. By Andrew Jack D iane-Laure Arjaliès, an assistant professor at the Ivey Business School at Western University in Canada, has won the 2021 teaching recognition award for overall excellence in sustainable finance education jointly awarded by the Financial Times and the Impact and Sustainable Finance Faculty Consortium. Her course, Sustainable Finance: Building the Business of the 21st Century, reflects the trend for business schools to focus on sustainable finance: incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions, for the benefit of society. Eight judges drawn from academia, impact investment, financial services and other sectors ranked her course the highest of 76 submissions from more than 50 universities around the world. They praised eight other examples of syllabi and teaching materials from different universities in specific categories: innovation and creativity; quantitative rigour; breadth of perspective; and most informed by recent developments. Many were developed and taught by practitioner-academics and others by full-time faculty. An increasing number of business schools are now recognising the importance of sustainability in their curricula, to help tackle climate change. The Impact and Sustainable Finance Faculty Consortium (ISFFC) includes more than 270 members from 135 universities in 28 countries that support teaching and research around impact investing and sustainable finance. But approaches differ substantially, with varied content and perspectives on whether to fully integrate sustainable finance into core courses or provide electives. The FT partnered with the ISFFC to seek strong examples to showcase best practices and encourage wider debate on future approaches. Arjaliès' interactive course which uses case studies, documentaries and games analyses why financial markets are currently not sustainable, and examines approaches including proxy voting, engagement, cryptocurrencies, hedge funds and socially responsible investing. Beatriz Mejia Asserias head of economic, climate and science at the British Embassy in Colombia, and one of the FT/ISFFC judges said: ""This is a truly great syllabus. It mixes the social and environmental perspectives, while addressing the needs of all the stakeholders involved in sustainable finance ... It is innovative and shows a great deal of involvement required from the student."" In the category for innovation and creativity in a syllabus, Marjolijn Dijksterhuis, adjunct faculty at Amsterdam Business School, University of Amsterdam, was recognised for an international study trip focused on inclusive finance in South Africa. It was adapted and operated entirely online because of coronavirus, and deployed an inclusive design, putting students in contact with South African impact-driven fintech entrepreneurs in small groups. In a sign of the importance of sustainable finance teaching beyond business schools, Deborah Burand from New York University's School of Law and Scott Taitel from its Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, were praised for innovation and creativity in teaching material for their case study Launching the MicroBuild Fund on housing    microfinance. It is available free on an interactive platform, and can be tailored to different audiences using video interviews with stakeholders, simulated negotiation exercises and actual deal documentation for lawyers. In the category for quantitative rigour in a syllabus, Shawn Cole and Vikram Gandhi from Harvard Business School were recognised for their Investing: Risk Return Impact course, providing coverage of the $30.7tn market and including a due diligence exercise. For teaching materials with quantitative rigour, Alnoor Ebrahim from Tufts University was praised for the chapter on the role of funders in his book Measuring Social Change, which explores what innovative funders are doing in measuring and supporting the performance of their investees. In the category teaching materials with breadth of perspective, to assess the global, interdisciplinary and inclusive nature of sustainable finance, Bhakti Mirchandani from Columbia University School of Professional Studies, was praised for her course Impact Finance for Sustainability, which explores the topic against the backdrop of events including the Arab Spring, the fall of the Berlin Wall, US federal budget cuts and the Paris Climate Agreement. For teaching materials, Alex Edmans at London Business School was praised for his freshly updated book Grow the Pie: How Great Companies Deliver Both Purpose and Profit, which makes the case for sustainability alongside a balanced perspective on the evidence against. For the award syllabus most informed by recent developments, Andrea Armeni at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service was commended for his course The Intersection of Finance and Social Justice, designed to explore the potential for capital to be a tool for social change and observe its limitations. For teaching materials most informed by recent developments, John Tobin-de La Puente at SC Johnson College of Business was praised for The Little Book of Investing in Nature, available free, which aims to help governments, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and others compare options for financing conservation.

40740b51a4275bec796c,2021-06-21,More opportunities on offer to study for specialist skills,"Alternative credentials Professional training groups offering niche qualifications with lower fees are finding new students and expanding globally. By Seb Murray William Kelly, chief executive of the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association, says retail investors are fuelling fresh interest in qualifications in alternative asset classes, such as private equity, as low interest rates and runaway stock markets that limit their returns from equities and bonds. Kelly says a move by the US government to allow private equity to be included in 401(k) pension plans which let individuals choose the assets they hold should add to demand for training. ""We have a whole new class of asset owner coming to the fore. And we have to think of a way to increase financial literacy,"" he says. Enter the Fundamentals of Alternative Investments programme, established by the CAIA association in 2013 and aimed at less-sophisticated investors. (The association's core membership is typically institutional investors, including professionals working at hedge funds.) Among more than 8,000 people to have signed up is Elaine Kennedy, a senior manager at Alter Domus, which provides corporate services to alternative funds that want to outsource administration, tax and regulatory compliance. ""I'm a chartered secretary by trade, so I needed something that was going to fill in the knowledge gap that I had,"" she says. The programme's flexibility appealed to Kennedy, as it involved 20 hours of self-paced online study. This allowed the Dublin-based manager to service a wider array of clients, without having to quit her job. ""The audience the course appeals to is enormous,"" she says, adding that she regards it as a stepping stone to more comprehensive training. Professional training organisations that offer specialist financial skills are finding new students and expanding globally. These niche qualifications compete on price with masters in finance programmes: they typically cost a fraction of the tuition fees for a degree (the Fundamentals costs $895). But Olivier Bossard, executive director of the €35,310 MiF at HEC Paris, says they are no substitute for degree courses, which offer students applied learning, a broad curriculum and career mobility. He says MiF programmes are aimed at different students, typically younger, rather than working professionals, who want to study full-time and to build a network in person. Despite coronavirus forcing a shift to remote teaching, Bossard says: ""We offer a much stronger sense of community."" Many training groups say their qualifications are complementary to MiF degrees and they have partnered with business schools to build industry designations into the academic curriculum especially the CFA programme for investment professionals. These partnerships have extended training providers' global reach. But for Helen Brand, chief executive of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, which offers the ACCA qualification, overseas expansion reflects a global desire to harmonise financial reporting standards. ""China and India are our fastest-growing student markets,"" she says. Of 536,812 new students that ACCA attracted in the year to March 31, more than 127,000 were from outside the UK and Ireland.    Other providers say demand from China is their main area of growth. CFA Institute, which offers the Chartered Financial Analyst credential for investment professionals, says China overtook the US as its biggest source of students years ago. Margaret Franklin, chief executive and president of CFA Institute, says success abroad reflects a drive by institutional investors to tap China's growing savings pool. ""You have a growing demographic of savers that is going to need good investment services. So we know that investment professionals need to be certified,"" she says. CFA Institute is expanding its offering to meet the demand for ""life-long learning"". This year, it launched a certification globally for investment professionals who want to strengthen their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.

f06a0aa6f7e0d31ec784,2021-06-21,Research finds engagement gets results,"Climate change is the most significant challenge facing humanity, and many commentators point to the malign influence of corporate profits, capital markets and investors in contributing to the trend. But while some argue the best response is divestment, our recent work suggests engagement by long-term shareholders such as pension funds is an effective way to improve companies' environmental impact. Activism, combined with monitoring and the threat of discipline by investors, can drive improvements. My fellow researchers and I examined the campaign of the Boardroom Accountability Project, launched by New York City's Pension Fund System in 2014. It identified companies that contributed significantly to climate change and those that lacked diversity, as well as other factors such as transparency in political contributions and excessive chief executive pay. The campaign aimed to give longterm shareholders a voice at these companies by allowing them to nominate directors to their boards. At the start, shareholder proposals were submitted to 75 companies, and have since expanded to more than 150. We found that the factories of the companies that were targeted reduced the release of chemicals that caused cancer. They also cut emissions of the greenhouse gases that contributed to global warming, improved air quality within a one-mile radius, and had significant spillover benefits to the local economy. Our analysis showed that companies were responding to the specific demands of the campaign, rather than to broader societal pressures for environmental improvements. They were introducing fundamental changes in their factories rather than taking greater risks or shifting pollution to third parties. These findings suggest that environmentally conscious shareholders may achieve their goals most effectively through climatefocused engagements. Such actions may also serve to boost the accountability of publicly listed companies, and provide a countervailing force to other parts of the market that are more difficult to monitor and regulate. Historically, in response to demands from activists, socially conscious investors such as foundation endowments and religious trusts have pressured the boards of controversial companies to align with their social goals. Many, if not most, aimed to impose change by threatening to disengage by selling their stakes. In the late 1970s, for example, students urged the trustees of university endowments to divest from companies that were reluctant to reduce or eliminate their operations in South Africa, in order to put pressure on the country's apartheid system. Yet research suggests the sale of investments had little effect on valuations, or on South Africa's financial market overall, if only because international corporate involvement was so small. More recently, in 2016, Waltham Forest, a London borough, became the first municipal government in the UK to announce that its pension scheme would sell out of all fossil fuel investments. Other investors, such as pension funds, have stopped investing in companies that operate in ""sin"" industries, such as alcohol, tobacco and gaming.    But such strategies come at a cost. Investors may lose out on returns from these profitable, albeit controversial, companies. For example, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the largest US public pension scheme, resolved two decades ago to divest from tobacco. A report it commissioned in 2016 estimated that it may have forfeited $3bn in missed returns as a result. Such divestment campaigns have become popular as money has flowed into funds earmarked for environmental, social and governance (ESG) targeted investments, and there has been broader awareness and activism around climate change. Yet the academic evidence suggests that the downward pressure on stock prices through the use of negative screening and filtering to clean portfolios of companies violating these principles is on average small and comes at the cost of lower future expected returns for the investors. Just as important, there is little guarantee that divestment campaigns are an effective means of achieving social goals. They lead investors to lose their voice as part-owners of a company. If they engaged instead, they would be able to speak up on how managers should address climate change and to exert influence over businesses on the front line of the climate crisis. Take the recent watershed case of ExxonMobil Corp, where investors were growing increasingly unhappy with the lack of corporate strategy to tackle climate change. Shareholders engaged in a proxy battle that resulted in the unseating of two directors from the board. Such examples reflect our research that investors may both achieve their social objectives and maximise financial return by monitoring and engagement with companies, rather than by divesting.

a7a6389f32e9a6f3c996,2021-06-19,Carbon counter: mile-high snub for exec jets,"Flying executives around the world in private planes does not chime well with company pledges for a lowcarbon future. Yet Facebook, Visa and others cannot seem to shake the habit. Chief executives like the convenience and privacy that private jets afford. They can also avoid fellow travellers who might have Covid-19. Aviation consultancy WingX Advance data show that, on a sevenday moving average basis, private flights have now recovered to 2019 levels. Commercial flights are still at about half the usual level. Private jets impress fellow highrollers. But they are both more expensive and more polluting than commercial air travel. For those considering a summer trip, aviation consultancy RDC calculates that a flight of about 900 miles from London Heathrow to Ibiza on a typical Airbus A320 emits about 16.5 tonnes of CO2. If the flight is full, this works out to just under 100kg of CO2 per seat. Compare that with an eight-seater business jet, which would produce about 6 tonnes of CO2 over the same distance. Each passenger in the private plane would account for 750kg of CO2. The private-jet passengers would still be responsible for more than twice the emissions of a first-class passenger in a commercial plane, who takes up the space of two or three economy seats. Companies are aware that shareholders dislike executive jets. Until now, the focus has been on cost. But in an era of ESG activism, carbon emissions are another black mark against corporate aircraft."
5cad7221e806e14402fc,2021-06-19,The capitalist case for taxing business,"Atrue winner would have shorted the stock beforehand. This week, with the moral authority that comes from abs you can cut sushi on, Cristiano Ronaldo cleared two bottles of full-fat Coke from a news conference desk and hailed agua instead. Censure from the most followed human on Instagram would sting any company. So would the subsequent $4bn hit in market value. But few are quite as self-doubting as Coca-Cola. Its ""2020 Business & Environmental, Social and Governance Report"" (yes, two ""ands"") is an 82-page apology for its core product, if not commerce itself. At this point, it is natural to contrast the piety of the modern corporation with its rococo tax schemes. (Sure enough, Coke has had fiscal issues with the feds.) But I no longer see the first as incompatible with the second. It is better understood as an outgrowth of it. The rise of ""CSR"" and ""ESG"" how cant loves an acronym mirrors the gradual decline of the effective corporate tax rate. The rationale of the C-suite is transparent: what we deny the common purse, we redress, or at least muddy, in other ways. It is not just guilt that makes a multinational speak the argot of the cultural left. It is not just naïveté that induces a bank to hire phalanxes of grifting sustainability consultants. It is calculation. A sly fox is throwing hounds off the scent. If I am right, then it follows that higher, better-enforced taxes spell the end of the simpering corporation. In essence, business will buy the right to live the uncommitted life again. We can revert to a time when the production of things that people want, and the sharing of the proceeds with government, was a social good. In that sense, a tougher tax regime is a reinforcement of capitalism. Few things commend the recent G7 accord on the subject more. Few things make the opposition of supposed conservatives weirder. 1984, the least prescient thing Orwell ever wrote, misread the trajectory of the left. The coming force was not the state, which even in Russia peaked around the time of publication. It was the Gramscian march through the institutions. And the result would not be totalitarian, just cloying and priggish. A harmless manifestation of this is the workplace-as-group-therapy. Call me British, but my expectations of an employer are that they send the monthly wire transfer and meet the statutory minimum on paid leave and the like. If they help me through a tough moment, they can expect reciprocal loyalty. What I don't want is to enter a pastoral communion with them or together remake the world. Far creepier is the truly messianic enterprise. Coca-Cola wants its US workforce to ""align with"" ethnic census data, like a Singaporean housing block. Microsoft's CSR mission seeks immigration reform, better humanitarian crisis response and ""alternatives to incarceration"". It resembles the programme of a political party (one, to be clear, I would vote for) and at times the bill of rights of a nation state. Even if you can live with the taxstarvation of government, who believes this Napoleonic range of activities is good qua business? Who thinks it is, in the old sense, sustainable? Christopher Hitchens had a response when the well-meaning but vapid stuck up for believers who don't proselytise or act on the meanest bits of scripture. ""All you're saying is that these people are so nice they're hardly religious at all.""    This is CSR all over. The gist of it is that a business is good precisely to the extent that it does not act like a business. Job creation, innovation, consumer choice: these become givens. In its own please-like-us report, Nike assures the grown adults who buy its silly shoes that at least 1.5 per cent of gross revenue goes on ""community impact"". The implication is that employing people does not impact a community. As an intellectual concession, this is vast, and corporates have gone along with it as cover for stiffing the taxman. The injury to the state is aired well enough. It is the disservice to capitalism itself that builds insidiously over time. The immediate cash saving is not worth the long-term fouling of the atmosphere in which business must operate. The obvious way out of this trap seems expensive. It is, in fact, a bargain. Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. janan.ganesh@ft.com It follows that higher, better-enforced taxes spell the end of the simpering corporation"
400a02b2a002a12a30e6,2021-06-19,Soft powers,"Gillian Tett makes the case for using anthropology to better understand ourselves. By Margaret Heffernan AHAC Anthro-Vision: How Anthropology Can Explain Business and Life by Gillian Tett Random House Business £20 304 pages Ba bRB3 A s a teenager, one of my most memorable education experiences was reading about a tribe in North America called the Nacirema. They resorted to odd oral rituals and their women baked their heads in ovens. Most students were appalled by such barbarity, only for our teacher to reveal that the tribal name spells American backwards. We were reading about ourselves through the eyes of an anthropologist. It was an unforgettable learning experience, leaving me with an abiding respect for outside perspectives. I did not become an anthropologist, but Gillian Tett did. The skills she acquired studying the marriage rituals of Tajikistan gave her a way of seeing lateral vision, asking questions, assuming nothing that notably yielded rewards when she predicted the financial crisis of 2007-08. In her new book, Tett, an FT journalist, makes a compelling case that ""anthro-vision"" can help us understand ourselves, our tribes, companies and communities, and to reduce our wilful blindness. Tett describes how anthropology has fuelled her journalism. Open-ended curiosity, interpreting markets through their symbols and rituals, illuminated early the dangerous isolation of the financial sector and, later, the growth of ESG investing. Another Tett observation that the tech sector was starting to look like pre-crash finance in its arrogance, wealth and isolation from reality was just as important. Engineers are a tribe much like bankers: isolated by power, money and a language no one else understands. They impose their values on products, which forces us to behave in constrained ways, undermining our autonomy. Quoting the anthropologist Jan English-Lueck, Tett concludes that engineers have merged ""useful"", ""efficient"" and ""good"" into a single moral concept but that morality is not comprehensively shared. The techlash has been fuelled by assumptions technologists made about voters, consumers, students and teachers without any engagement with those communities. Why not, Tett asks, work with these groups, and understand their values and concerns, rather than against them? We've been sold the myth that with enough hard data, we can know everything. But numbers can only show what is; they don't reveal why. Soft data is what anthropology reveals: the meaning behind behaviours. In Japan, a KitKat isn't a relaxing snack (""Have a break""), it's a good-luck charm. In Malaysia and Singapore, a car isn't just a machine for travelling; it's also a haven of social safety that people treat a lot like home. Anthropological insights don't come from surveys but from fieldwork: directly observing and talking to people. Without such understanding, we forcefit meaning on to others, make costly mistakes and miss opportunities for knowledge, innovation and legitimacy.    So-called scientific management using metrics to assess everything from productivity to employee mood hasn't prevented business failures. Focus on returns raised no concerns about some reckless banks pre-2007, but the practice of awarding cash or cabbages to high or low performers would have caught an anthropologist's eye. After each such fiasco, culture is deemed the culprit, HR deputed to design surveys and the ensuing change programmes, which mostly fail. But companies are communities and anthropologists, whose study is the social systems of meaning, could bring more pragmatic insight. Meetings don't carry the same expectations to different people, just as the culture on one floor of a building won't necessarily be the same as on another. Decades of leadership and teamwork consulting have focused on retraining individuals, whereas unpacking webs of collective meaning could untangle knotted collaboration. The recommendation not to hire for cultural fit is just one of several good and possibility-rich suggestions. With case studies and examples ranging from Google's errors to pandemic beards, Tett explains anthropological revelations invisible to computers. I found myself thinking of other, unsolved, cases that might be cracked by thinking like an anthropologist: the toxic Home Office, the flailing Church of England or our failure to design really good education systems. Where data scientists and ideologists assert, anthropologists could reveal. Inventing words in the hope of creating a brand has become a tiresome fad in business publishing, but ""anthrovision"", however, is a useful way to illuminate much that can't be seen any other way and so are philosophy, literature and history. In an age obsessed with hard science, it's becoming painfully obvious that the so-called ""soft"" subjects social sciences and the humanities have the power to reveal what otherwise remains obscure. One of the glories of Anthro-Vision is that it never argues (as many do) that its way of seeing is the only way. It's a timely call for decision makers to wean themselves off their dependency on big data and embrace the full complexity of human life.

489734cd94132777b3d4,2021-06-18,Cumming's Aviva exit a sign of waning star culture,"'I don't see myself as a star fund manager,"" Richard Buxton told the Financial Times in 2014, which is of course exactly what you'd expect a star fund manager with any sense at all to say in an interview. It was a year after the then-head of UK equity at Schroders quit the UK's biggest fund manager to move to Old Mutual, a year in which the fund he ran had grown from £160m to £1.1bn, boosted in part by money from his old shop. Three years later, and another heavyweight made a shock move: David Cumming left Standard Life after 18 years, a departure dubbed a ""big loss"" for an investment house in the throes of merging with rival Aberdeen Asset Management. Cumming's ""mutually agreed"" departure this week from Aviva Investors, where he was chief investment officer for equities, prompted headlines but less business-related angst. The unit is a sufficiently small part of Aviva's overall business not to trouble the insurer's investors. But being a celestial body of the fund management universe also ain't what it used to be. Gone are the days when the big names that drew big money ruminated about which boards or bosses didn't cut it and took action accordingly. The Cumming exit isn't a case of a fallen star (and in any case, it's hard even to register against Neil Woodford in that particular category). The fund that Cumming managed was up 62 per cent over the past year, according to Morningstar Direct, against a category average of 24 per cent. The official explanation is that Aviva is building ""a market-leading sustainable outcomes franchise"". What this seems to mean is going all-in on ESG and focusing on where it thinks it can win business which still includes UK and global equities despite shedding more than a third of its equities team. About 10-12 people are thought to be leaving, in the US and France as well as the UK. This feels like a dose of good old-fashioned cost-cutting. Stars don't come cheap. And nor does competing for external funds: about 80 per cent of Aviva Investors' £370bn under management comes from the insurer itself. Aviva, the group, is under pressure to cut costs, not least from activist investor Cevian. It's hard to see how the cull doesn't weaken the effort to win thirdparty money. Big names, perhaps, are no longer considered essential. Fund management has been increasingly depersonalised and institutionalised. Key person risk and tricky internal politics was probably enough for companies to favour a different approach. But industry change has done the rest: the rise of cheap, manager-agnostic passive investing has squeezed active managers' heft (if not their UK fees, which have been remarkably resilient). Portfolio construction guys and risk management whizzes get top billing. Even boutiques now tend to emphasise their process rather than their people, says David McCann at Numis. What's perplexing about Aviva's emphasis on ESG here is that Cumming has long spoken up on governance    issues such as executive pay; he recently bashed Deliveroo over workers' rights and its dual-class share structure. This is another area where active managers generally have lost some clout, with decisions outsourced to proxy firms such as ISS and the growing influence of centralised governance or stewardship teams. But Aviva has argued that partnership between stock pickers and stewardship is a particularly effective one. Engine No. 1, the titchy hedge fund with an even-titchier stake in Exxon, has this year shown that size doesn't have to equate to impact in the world of sustainability. And an industry that has got religion on stakeholder concerns at the same time as going cold on personal branding or visibility may miss a trick. ESG investing can't all be about marketing, screening, standards and data (not least because the latter isn't currently very good). At some point, it has to be about standing up and shouting when something stinks. Without that, it risks making less of a difference and being considerably less interesting to boot. helen.thomas@ft.com Big names, perhaps, are no longer seen as essential. Fund management has been depersonalised"
6e53094d4a03a4345d9c,2021-06-17,Energy M&A: reality cools renewables Renewable energy stocks have fallen as passive fund flows into the sector have slowed. Global...,"Twitter: @FTLex Companies that want to stop the world from getting too hot have had a cool reception from markets. But the correction in renewable energy stocks represents a pause to regroup rather than a retreat. Deals involving financial buyers such as EQT Infrastructure and the partner sought by Italian utility Edison will continue. A new energy matrix is crystallising. The sector should be a happy hunting ground for M&A bankers for years to come. Big Oil will belatedly buy into renewables while ditching dirty assets via spin-offs or sales to private buyers. A spate of defensive mergers has already begun among midsize energy groups. The bubble in listed stocks pumped up by ESG funds has partially deflated. The re-rating is already reflected in deal prices. Swedish private equity group EQT is offering €1.2bn for Spanish solar operator Solarpack, or €26.5 a share. That is well below a peak of €35 at the start of the year, despite a 45 per cent premium to the current share price At seven times expected 2022 revenues, the purchase is at a steep discount to rival Spanish solar group Solaria at 13 times. On other measures, the deal looks more generous. EQT is paying €500,000 per current MW of capacity, roughly double current installation costs. Add in Solarpack's pipeline of projects and the price falls closer to build cost. The Spanish solar market shows what lies ahead in renewables. A flood of capital has fostered competition and lowered returns. An auction for 3GW of new capacity attracted a record 83 bidders. The average price of €25 per MWh represented a 29 per cent discount to current prices. The 180MW won by Solaria in January at €29 per MWh might generate an internal rate of return of 8 per cent, says UBS. Edison will have to take a realistic view of the price financial buyers might offer for a 30 per cent to 49 per cent stake in the renewables business that it hopes to sell. Decarbonisation is creating a trove of reference data for deals. The bigger it gets, the more closely price and value should align."
ea0eb1b1ea4147553b24,2021-06-17,SK accused by environmental activists of greenwashing following gas U-turn,"Commodities One of South Korea's biggest conglomerates is facing a backlash from activist groups after finalising a large Australian liquefied natural gas deal months after promising to end new overseas oil and gas investments. The scrutiny of SK Group, one of Asia's top producers of oil, electric vehicle batteries and computer chips, comes as activists turn their attention to overseas oil and gas projects, estimated to be valued at more than $100bn, in the wake of successful campaigns to stop companies and countries from investing in coal. Environmental groups claimed SK's decision in March to spend $1.4bn developing the offshore Barossa-Caldita gasfield contradicts a pledge made in November to abandon new fossil fuel investments. The promise by SK, Korea's third-biggest conglomerate, was part of a pivot to environmental, social and governance investments spearheaded by Chey Taewon, its chair and biggest shareholder. ""The tremendous amount of greenhouse gas from the Barossa-Caldita project will raise serious doubts on SK Group's ESG initiative, and more importantly, it will undermine the global efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" said a letter sent to Chey by dozens of South Korean, Australian and other international environmental groups, including Greenpeace. SK's energy unit said the development would cut ""nearly all"" carbon emissions by using carbon capture and storage, a fledgling technology that traps CO2 and pipes it into deep underground reservoirs, as well as through the purstate chase of carbon credits. ""Our investment was made on the condition that LNG is developed in an eco-friendly, low-carbon way,"" said SK E&S. Chey, who controls group assets of more than $200bn, has been overseeing a multiyear readjustment of SK's portfolio, including divestments from billions of dollars in oil and gas exploration and retail assets. Barossa-Caldita, the Timor Sea project being led by Australian producer Santos, is expected to deliver LNG to South Korea for 20 years from 2025. SK argued Barossa-Caldita should not be considered a new development, noting that it has spent $600m on the project since 2012. Activists described SK's claims of carbon-free LNG, which is natural gas that has been chilled so it can be transported on ships, as ""egregious greenwashing"". ""So-called CO2-free LNG ... is not only grossly misleading but also lacks economic or technical feasibility ... any attempt to greenwash fossil fuel development with unverified plans for CCS lacking technological or economic feasibility is unacceptable,"" the letter said."
07a0dfab2228f57d0f7e,2021-06-17,Boohoo braced for rebellion at annual meeting,"Retail Shareholders advised to vote against co-founder's re-election to board Boohoo is set to face an investor rebellion at its annual meeting tomorrow as shareholders and advisers raise concern over the role of its co-founders in the labour abuse scandal that has rocked the fast-fashion company. The Manchester-based group was hit last summer by fresh evidence of labour abuse among its UK suppliers, including pay far below minimum wage, and has since strived to convince shareholders its clothes are made ethically. Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, influential advisers to many of the biggest asset managers, have proposed investors vote against the re-election of Carol Kane, cofounder and an executive director, arguing Boohoo's supply chain problems were allowed to develop on her watch. Mahmud Kamani, co-founder and chair, was re-elected in 2019 and will not face a vote this year. But Glass Lewis suggested it was also concerned by his presence, noting ""the board may be better placed to ensure independent oversight ... without the potential conflicts faced by the presence of the founding executives."" Sébastien Thevoux-Chabuel, a portfolio manager at Comgest, a top 20 shareholder, said he was casting a vote against several directors up for re-election, including Kane, over concerns about the board's handling of environmental, social and governance issues. ""While the company has listened to us ... and it is delivering on its ESG road map, it is not making the progress we were expecting in terms of board composition to really up its governance of ESG matters at board level,"" he told the Financial Times. He is also voting against executive pay at Boohoo. Glass Lewis said Kane, who was joint chief executive until 2019, had a ""direct role in contributing to inadequate governance practices, which ultimately led to the present supply chain issues"". ISS said a vote against Kane was warranted because she ""is considered ultimately accountable for the failures in governance, stewardship and risk oversight, which have caused significant reputational harm to the company in connection with the poor working conditions and pay in the company's supply chain in Leicester."" Kane is unlikely to lose the vote because of her and the Kamani family's large ownership together they control 28 per cent of Boohoo. Jupiter, Boohoo's largest independent shareholder with just under 10 per cent, according to CapitalIQ, is also backing her re-election. Boohoo said it was ""important to recognise that the board has acted unanimously in developing a robust plan of action and drawing up the rigorous Agenda for Change, which has had favourable feedback in discussions with multiple institutional shareholders"". Boohoo has hired Brian Leveson, the judge who oversaw the inquiry into the phone hacking scandal, to monitor its supply chain. It has also linked certain bonuses to progress on the matter.    Boohoo last year announced a plan to pay bonuses of up to £100m to Kamani and Kane, as well as £50m to other executives. Both Glass Lewis and ISS have encouraged shareholders to vote against the plan, which the latter described as ""excessive"". 'It is not making the progress we were expecting in terms of board composition'"
f9e59d3ef3a58142f33f,2021-06-16,"PwC to add 100,000 staff in five years as ESG consultancy services bear fruit","PwC will increase its global headcount by more than a third over the next five years as part of a $12bn investment in recruitment, training, technology and deals designed to capture a booming market for environmental, social and governance advice. The plan marks a significant acceleration from the audit and consulting group's $7.4bn investment since 2016, over which time its annual revenues increased 20 per cent to $43bn. The expansion will add 100,000 people to a workforce that has grown by more than a quarter, to 284,000 people, in the past five years. It includes a $3bn plan to double its Asia-Pacific business, which brought in $6.4bn in revenue in the year to June 2020, and the launch of ""trust leadership institutes"" in the US and Asia to train clients in business ethics and the rudiments of ESG. Investors are increasingly scrutinising the social impact of the businesses they back and its effect on their returns, and PwC's investment plan is the strongest signal yet that the Big Four accounting firms expect ESG advice to become a core part of their business, just as digital capabilities have become the norm over the past decade. Bob Moritz, global chair of PwC, said the firm was ""going to massively invest to redefine itself and rebrand itself to make sure we're valuable for what our clients need and what the world needs"". The market for professional advice on ""pure"" sustainability issues, such as clean technology and sustainable investing, reached $1bn globally in 2020, according to Source Global Research, which expects that combining advice on sustainability with other services will be even more lucrative for advisers. The other Big Four firms Deloitte, EY and KPMG are including sustainability issues within longstanding practices such as audit and assurance, and are giving ESG greater prominence within their businesses. Accounting firms are also providing ESG training to auditors as the industry prepares for increased regulation in areas such as climate-related disclosures by companies. As regulators discuss standardised ESG disclosures akin to the international accounting rules agreed decades ago, all PwC staff needed at least ""a baseline understanding"" of ESG, said Tim Ryan, US chair."
e4cb9eb46fe3a0d02908,2021-06-15,Grasp of issues raised by Grenfell remains shaky,"It is four years since the Grenfell fire. A tragedy born out of systemic failure around fire safety and building regulations has morphed into a seeming inability to deal with the fallout, and to protect the people least at fault. The government's headline figures that more than 90 per cent of about 470 high-rise buildings have completed or started remediation work to remove unsafe aluminium-composite material (ACM) cladding barely tells half the story. Even in this most obvious area ? tackling the cladding at fault in Grenfell on buildings over 18m ? only 64 per cent of private sector buildings have had their cladding removed. (The public sector is further advanced). This has expanded beyond ACM though. It is nearly three years since the government advised building owners to look for other types of cladding, particularly what is known as HPL. It is a year and a half since an industryled attempt to give comfort to lenders through inspections of buildings' cladding, insulation and firebreaks, the EWS1 form. But a shortage of qualified surveyors and failure rates of 90 per cent have trapped millions in unsellable, unmortgageable homes, exposing a raft of non-cladding issues and gumming up the market. The question of ""Who pays?"" has dominated the headlines, and rightly so given the failure to live up to the principle that leaseholders shouldn't foot the bill. But the UK is debating who should bear the cost without adequately defining what the problem actually is. What's needed is an independent audit to look at which buildings are affected and to assess any repairs needed. This isn't quick or easy. But it could, as was seen in Australia, enable a risk-based approach to remediation work. That in turn could ensure work happens where it is most needed, in a sector beset by skills shortages and with six-month lead times on key products. Instead, it's not clear how big the issue is or what fixing it might cost. The best available guess puts the universe of residential buildings over 11m at nearly 90,000, half of which are in the private sector and two-thirds are assumed to not have cladding. An understandable tendency towards risk aversion by inspectors, and some inherent conflicts of interest in the leaseholder system, mean residents are being presented with huge bills for work they are not sure is really needed. Meanwhile, the government's £5.1bn building safety fund, and the rightly panned loan scheme for buildings between 11m and 18m, only cover cladding. The housing select committee has estimated the cost of full remediation works could be up to £15bn. The housebuilding industry is being asked to stump up £2bn through a new tax over 10 years to remedy cladding, even as the issue continues to grow. The listed sector reckons it built less than 20 per cent of the buildings over 18m, and some will not have built any. But the government's broader principle is reasonable. About a dozen companies account for more than 60 per    cent of new homes built annually and have an interest in the sound functioning of the market. They have benefited from plenty of government largesse in supporting house prices; the proposed tax is at worst 5 per cent of net earnings for the listed sector, says Liberum. Again a policy-first, details-second approach has unintended consequences. While the sector has pledged about £500m to remediating its buildings, according to the industry body, that belies a wide range of views about housebuilders' responsibilities ? something ESG teams are, and should be, considering. The sector is alive with talk about who has delayed remediation plans since the tax was proposed in February. And in that light, industry complaints about ""paying twice"" have some merit. It would be perverse if the more enlightened, who have done more to rectify failings, were penalised compared to those that sat on their hands. The government could usefully do some of the levelling up it is so keen on between the leaders and laggards, distinguishing between the responsibility to remediate buildings constructed and the contribution to fixing the system overall. That case is easier to make, however, with a proper understanding of what went wrong, where and how it must be fixed. helen.thomas@ft.com It would be perverse if the more enlightened, who have done more to rectify failings, were penalised"

Coastal homeowners have reason to be worried. So do shareholders. Until recently, reinsurers and banks have borne most of the market risk of climate change. Now things are changing. Individual companies are being held explicitly responsible for the risks of global warming. A court in The Hague has ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its emissions. The International Energy Agency says energy groups must stop new oil and gas projects in order to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Indeed, market penalties for companies that make bad risk decisions around climate are broader than we might think. A report from Pentland Analytics, ""Risk, Reputation and Accountability"", looked at several episodes of extreme disaster, including the 2017 hurricane season, which was the most expensive in US history. Deborah Pretty, the author, examined US-listed companies with annual revenues exceeding $5bn that disclosed financial damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Modelling their share price reaction across the year, she found an average 5 per cent discount to the S&P 500 index the equivalent of $18bn in lost shareholder value. Pretty also drilled down into companies that had more than 10 per cent of their global insured property values in an affected area, to see what precautions such as flood or wind protection they had taken. Among companies that reported financial damage, fewer than half of recommended measures had been completed. On the other hand, among those that reported no material financial damage, almost two-thirds of the recommendations were completed. Bottom line? Market perceptions of adverse outcomes from such natural disasters have ""changed from bad luck to bad management"", says Pretty. Share prices now reflect whether or not the C-suite is taking the risk from climate change seriously. Indeed, Pretty's research shows that the top performing companies are those that consider resilience more important than a balance sheet bargain. In other words, they take every possible action to mitigate such risk, even if the models show that the risk is slight. This might baffle economists, but as one engineer interviewed in the study put it, ""Look, if you have four holes in your boat, and you plug three of them, you're still gonna sink!"" It's part of the argument for resilience over economic ""efficiency"", which is influencing not only preparations for climate related disasters but also supply chains (com- panies are starting to make them shorter) and cyber risk. Pretty notes that between 2010 and 2020, poorly prepared companies that came under cyber attack underperformed the market by 20 per cent in the year following the attack. If regulators have their way, these risks will become more explicit, particularly with regard to climate. G7 leaders last week announced their commitment to mandatory climate-related financial disclosures, modelled on those recommended by the G20's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. This provides a road map for how to integrate climate risk metrics in corporate governance and strategy. Europe has made more progress than the US in forcing companies to disclose such risk. In Washington, the body best placed to create and enforce such regulation would be the Securities and Exchange Commission. But under President Donald Trump, the SEC loosened regulation generally and failed to mention climate at all. The US    government is still subsidising coastal flood insurance, even as cities like Miami explore building multibillion-dollar walls to hold back rising tides. If the Biden administration has its way, that will change. The SEC, now headed by the ambitious regulator Gary Gensler, just finished gathering public comments on ESG reporting rules. Gensler says he wants to bring ""consistency and comparability"" to what companies report. That could mean sector specific standards for emissions reporting as well as information on the amount of waterfront property that a company holds, or prevention measures they've taken around flood zones. Some activists are pushing for extremely granular disclosures around water insecurity, heat stress and the extent to which businesses could be affected by disease, political unrest and migration. A Center for American Progress report from February, coauthored by Andy Green (now the US Department of Agriculture's senior adviser for fair and competitive markets) lays out the potential range of future reporting requirements. Should companies be forced to quantify their ESG footprint in ways that make it easy to compare sectors and individual firms' efforts, it's hard to overstate what the market impact could be. The exposure of, say, an apparel maker to agricultural production (and the subsequent potential for crop damage via drought, heat or pestilence) could dramatically affect shareholder value. A price on carbon could change the calculus for some exporters, making activities such as long-distance shipping of heavy machinery much more costly. Asset managers holding too many investments in high-carbon sectors could find themselves in breach of their fiduciary duties. As hurricane season begins, we might be in for a sea change in markets as well as the weather. rana.forooha@ft.com Share prices now reflect whether or not the C-suite is taking the risk from global warming seriously"
910939325c313ea0453f,2021-06-11,Independent probe finds Toshiba colluded with government,"Industrials The depth of collusion between Toshiba, the Japanese government and the former investment head of the world's biggest pension fund to influence board nominations last year has been laid bare by an independent probe. A 147-page report released yesterday details the collaboration between the company and the government and alleges that prime minister Yoshihide Suga, who was chief cabinet secretary at the time, received updates on activists' campaigns ahead of the July 2020 annual meeting, which it ultimately concluded was ""not fairly managed"". Based on text messages, emails and other correspondence, the report describes how senior figures at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry collaborated with Toshiba's senior management to prevent executives being voted out of their positions. The investigators conclude that the plot included ""acts suspected to be against laws"" and represented an attempt to unfairly restrict the exercise of shareholder rights. Central to the campaign was Nobuaki Kurumatani, then chief executive of Toshiba who faced a knife-edge vote to approve his reappointment which he narrowly survived. He resigned in April amid fears that he might fail to win approval at the 2021 annual meeting later this month and following a botched $20bn buyout offer from private equity group CVC. The report, compiled by three lawyers including the head of O'Melveny & Myers' Tokyo office, accuses the Japanese conglomerate of devising ""a plan to effectively prevent shareholders from exercising their shareholder proposal and voting rights at the AGM by giving undue influence to shareholders"". In a text message, Kurumatani told one of his senior executives that Toshiba's efforts to suppress moves by activists would not fall to its financial advisers Goldman Sachs and Nomura but would be mostly handled by the government. He is quoted as writing: ""METI will play the main role this time."" The scandal surrounding the AGM was, to many investors, the culmination of five years of turmoil at the group. A series of calamities have included an accounting fraud, the collapse of the US nuclear unit, the sale of the prized chip business and a narrowly avoided delisting from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Investors have suspected that Toshiba enjoyed high levels of protection from the government, and that shareholder interests were consistently suppressed. Toshiba was forced to accept the independent probe after losing a proxy battle with top investors in March. One of Toshiba's shareholders said the probe ""confirms our worst, worst fears about the relationship between the Japanese government and its biggest corporations. The question everyone is going to be asking themselves now is whether this was an isolated incident"". The report stands in stark contrast with Toshiba's investigation into the meeting, which concluded there were no problems.    ""There is no way as either a shareholder or a director that I would be supportive of a number of the candidates which have been nominated by the company for the upcoming AGM,"" Raymond Zage, a non-executive director of Toshiba, told the Financial Times after the report was released. The information previously provided to the board on the issue of METI involvement, he added, had been ""highly misleading"". The report is especially damaging to the reputation of Hiromichi Mizuno, the former chief investment officer of Japan's $1.6tn Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), a Tesla board member and a high-profile champion to ESG investors around the world. Mizuno's efforts, which were first revealed by the FT, were focused on influencing the voting of the Harvard Management Company one of Toshiba's largest shareholders at the time. By last year's AGM, Mizuno was acting as an executive adviser to METI: the report concluded that he used that position to influence HMC to the point where it abstained from voting at the meeting. The report also cast doubt on Mizuno's account of events. In March Mizuno told the FT: ""I told Harvard very clearly that I was not representing the Japanese government. I offered to give them [Harvard] a better understanding of the situation in Tokyo on a friendly basis."" Yesterday, Toshiba and METI said they would review the report. Mizuno, described as ""Mr M"" in the report, was not immediately available for comment. Both Mizuno and METI have earlier denied to the FT that he was acting on the instructions of the government."
9e0872d86f9af3ad9528,2021-06-09,AI generates a textual revolution in investment,"Robin Wigglesworth Markets Insight W hen US Steel released America's first annual report more than a century ago, it was an admirably trim 40 pages and mostly photos of smokestacks. Its 2020 annual report clocked in at 162 packed pages and even this is concise by modern standards. Public companies release reams of financial information and insight into their business every quarter but the annual report is the big blue whale of corporate reporting. These days, the average length is equivalent to a 240- page novel, according to S&P Global. It is popular to bemoan that quarterly and annual reports are word salads, consisting of vast amounts of often useless reporting requirements and standardised legal caveats, and then sprinkled with a big dose of PR guff. The core accounting numbers have not changed meaningfully in quantity and quality over the past century, cynics complain. It is true that corporate reports contain verbiage that would make even a journalist blush. But instead of heaping scorn on these reports, savvy investors should embrace this admittedly waffly textual information as a potential gold mine that can finally be mined with modern technology. Historically, investing has primarily rested on a bedrock of numbers, such as stock prices and profits, revenues and research spending. Traditional stockpickers would supplement this with plenty of qualitative analysis, such as interviewing a company's chief financial officer, chatting to industry experts and poring through annual reports. Yet the swelling volume of corporate statements means that no one can realistically consume everything. In the US, the ""risk factors"" section of annual reports has alone almost tripled in length since 2006 and now averages more than 11,000 words, according to a recent report by S&P Global. But there are valuable signals hidden within even the subtlest changes, said Frank Zhao, an analyst at S&P's Market Intelligence team. The tool to glean tradable signals from textual noise is known as ''natural language processing"", an increasingly popular field of artificial intelligence that involves teaching machines how to read and understand the intricacies of human language. NLP allows tracts of previously recondite non-numeric ""unstructured"" data to be harvested and analysed at dizzying speeds. The potential is immense. Kai Wu, a former GMO analyst who now runs Sparkline Capital, a start-up investment firm, said many trading strategies built on traditional data are ""tapped out"" after having been analysed to death for decades and now mined to oblivion. ""But once you cross the Rubicon into the world of unstructured data, suddenly the fruit is hanging much lower,"" Wu wrote in a paper last month. Many sophisticated quantitative investors those that primarily use algorithms to systematically trade, rather than traditional human fund managers are already grasping at this fruit. Last year, an NBER paper esti- mated that    algorithmic downloads of quarterly and annual reports in the US exploded from about 360,000 in 2003 to 165m in 2016, when they accounted for 78 per cent of all downloads. Since 2016, the rate has almost certainly soared further. Industry insiders say there is a quasi arms race nowadays between NLP algorithms that scour corporate statements and company executives that attempt to outfox them by avoiding certain touchy words and phrases. Yet, in reality, NLP is an opportunity for all investment managers, not just quants that try to exploit textual signals systematically. For example, Nomura analyst Joe Mezrich has used an NLP system to scour through transcripts of corporate executives talking to financial analysts, grading the companies by their apparent adherence to ESG standards. He discovered that the stocks of the most ESG-compliant companies performed better than the broader equity market. Quarterly and annual reports are now generally released in a machinefriendly format but they are the tip of the iceberg of written information that investors can rummage around for valuable signals. Transcripts of management calls with analysts or TV interviews with chief executives, newspaper reports, central bank speeches or even social media chatter can all be mined. The finance industry loves its buzzwords and anything to do with artificial intelligence is particularly hot these days and should be treated warily. But we might be at the beginning of a textual investing revolution that could upend the industry. robin.wigglesworth@ft.com 'Cross the Rubicon into unstructured data and suddenly the fruit is hanging much lower'"
173e5d811ca89a9ea5a5,2021-06-09,Miners' woes show need for climate 'bad banks',"Y ou can't please all of the people all of the time. Except if you're Anglo American or other miners with thermal coal assets: then you can't seem to please all of the people any of the time. Anglo did win some ESG plaudits for its plans to spin off its remaining South African thermal coal mines into a Johannesburg-listed company called Thungela. It also took sustainability brickbats from those who saw it cutting loose a problem to its shareholders. Boatman Capital, the short-selling research group, this week questioned assumptions around the rehabilitation of Thungela's mines, arguing new regu- lations could nearly triple costs to $1.4bn, wiping out the company's value. South Africa's newest coal miner was always going to have a turbulent start as international investors scarpered: the shares fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday's debut before jumping yesterday. This troubled separation adds to a sense that a different model is needed, what some in the industry think of as a ""bad bank"" structure to manage the demise of pariah climate assets. The miners are just the canary in this particular thermal coal mine. Divestment and coal exit policies, from investors and financiers, have made coal largely uninvestable in western finance, and uncomfortable to hold for the big listed miners. Glencore is unusual in keeping coal, with plans to run its production down by 2050, a position that could still come under pressure. As the transition to net zero accelerates, more and more assets will become ""stranded"": Not just in terms of oil and gas left in the ground but in terms of assets with no good owner from the point of view of the markets and the planet, whether that is mines, associated rail and port infrastructure, or oil and gas production. True, Anglo sent Thungela on its way with no debt, a hefty endowment and protection against a sliding coal price. The mines stay in the listed sector, rather than disappearing into the shadows of private ownership. But the environmental impact looks, at best, neutral. In fact, the new company seems more likely to try to lengthen the mines' lives, currently only five to 11 years. And a smaller company is less able to handle the mines' rehabilitation costs, which are uncertain. What's needed, argues Tim Buckley at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, is an alternative to the options of divest or retain, one with the right funding, transparency and corporate governance and that recognises that this will be a 15-year process. Just as financial institutions turned to bad banks to manage toxic assets after the financial crisis, the miners need a way to quarantine theirs. This could keep the assets tied to the deep pockets and (one would hope) higher standards of the global listed sector but separate them from commodities such as copper, nickel and cobalt, which the world needs more of in the climate transition. It is a structure that industry chatter suggests is being considered by some miners and their advisers, possibly with involvement of outside investors chosen for their environmental credibility. Sustainably minded investors would need to sign up to a structure that keeps coal, and ultimately other fossil fuels, associated with companies they're invested in. And there is a credibility gap to bridge in ensuring mines are    run off to schedule, that sinking funds for rehabilitation are untouchable and that communities are properly supported. This could involve some public sector involvement, argues Ben Caldecott at the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme. It might ultimately need to: the understandable ambivalence of some jurisdictions such as South Africa or Australia to the idea of putting coal mines into run-off, with jobs and communities at stake, has been a complicating factor for miners. That has included discouraging progressive rehabilitation as sites are mined and even allowing smaller companies to tap ringfenced clean-up funds, says Buckley. But Anglo isn't alone in battling to figure out what to do with its coal. And a robust bad bank model could find itself in demand far beyond mining in future. helen.thomas@ft.com As the transition to net zero accelerates, more and more assets will become 'stranded'"
040f20c9e3b24fe1c820,2021-06-07,Corporate change in Japan will need more than pregnant pandas,"A t one point last Friday, shares in the operator of Totenko, a famous restaurant in Tokyo's Ueno district, were trading 29 per cent higher after news broke that a giant panda living in the zoo across the road might be pregnant. Two days earlier, shares in Japan's biggest maker of baby goods, Pigeon, rose sharply on the announcement from Beijing that a demographically nervous China would allow couples to have up to three children. A day before that, I tried to put some questions to the management of Globeride, a Japanese company behind some of the world's highest-tech fishing equipment. Its stock has been propelled 87 per cent higher since last year by a pandemic-driven resurgence of the sport. All such inquiries, the company said, must come via post. Each of these episodes fits one of the many subplots that have been attached for decades to Japanese equity investment. For example, there is always an obscure stock to buy or sell on a news Or, Japan offers developed market plays on China. Or, behind even the most futuristic-looking Japanese technology can lurk management of stultifying, steam-powered intransigence. These are nice perennials, but for the real investment juices to flow through the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market has always required a grand narrative. Invariably this is woven around the assertion that some logjam in corporate Japan is about to clear, with rapid, transformative impact. Usually, the problem from investors' point of view resides with management and either its protected complacency or structural nonalignment with shareholders. Since around 2013, corporate governance reform, government pension fund rebalancing, shareholder activism, cross-shareholding unwinding, womenomics and tightening stewardship requirements have all had stints as the brokers' favourite logjam-clearing stories. In fits and starts, each has triggered big investment inflows, before yielding to a frustration that this is Japan and nothing actually moves that quickly. At the moment, brokers and investors moan, Japan suffers from a severe deficit of grand narratives. However, one unusual feature of the Tokyo market is that, thanks to a quirk of organised criminal history, a 10-day period at the end of June provides an annual snapshot of corporate Japan. It is in this period that the vast majority of companies hold their AGMs. Originally, the aim was to protect them from corporate racketeers. In a research note last week, Mizuho Securities chirped that the percentage of listed companies holding their AGMs on the peak day of June 29 had hit an all-time low of a mere 27.3 per cent. As has been the case for about six years, the Japanese AGM season will provide rapidly digestible evidence of three things: how empowered activists feel, how awkward the big institutions feel about backing them, and how threatened managements feel by both of those. The evidence, three weeks out, is not yet compelling. Yes, there are many more activists on shareholder registers than ever. About 40 per cent of them are domestic, and they make increasingly strident proposals at the AGMs. Between them, CLSA's John Seagrim calculates, activists have a record ¥5.6tn ($51bn) of declared investment across 416 listed companies, respectively 60 per cent and 25 per cent higher than this time last year. Also, there was something of a watershed earlier this year when big non-acstory.    tivist money voted with activists against the management of Toshiba. It all looks buoyant, but it has done so for a while and progress is now sludgy. Despite the appearance of change, half of Japanese stocks still trade below book value and carry not just a record value of cash as a proportion of equity, but the largest such ratio in developed markets. In this context, it was revealing last week when Kathy Matsui, who stood down as Goldman Sachs Japan's chief strategist last year, launched an ESG themed venture capital fund focused on growth- to late-stage domestic startups. It is an arena, she says, where there is a prospect of instilling as standard the sort of principles to which listed companies have proved so resistant. Matsui's best-known coinage was the term ""womenomics"", which remained for many years one of Japan's most consistent grand narratives of change if not one with consistent results. After three decades spent trying to foment change at listed Japanese corporations, she says, her efforts will shift to doing so before companies go public and before, as she puts it, ""it's too late"". The investment subplots of Japan, from pregnant panda booms and factory automation to solid-state batteries and hydrogen vehicles, will remain stockpicker favourites. The grand narrative may need a rethink. leo.lewis@ft.com For real investor juices to flow through the market there normally needs to be a grand narrative"
924ee35454fdf5c4298c,2021-06-07,Farming insects for food battles the 'ick factor',"Start-ups emerge around the world as buzz builds about expanding the creatures' role in our diets beyond animal feed Harry Wright's new range of smartly packaged seasonings looks like the sort of artisanal fare found at any foodie market or upmarket deli. But they have a distinctive ingredient: ground, roasted crickets. ""Once the crickets are in with the herbs and spices, you can't taste, see or smell them,"" Wright said, adding that ""there is none of the 'bush tucker trial' vibe"" a reference to a hit reality TV show where contestants are made to eat the most unappealing of bugs. Wright hopes his business, Short-Horn Super Seasonings, can help alter public attitudes towards the eating of insects, which proponents see as an inevitable solution to a looming global food crisis. As fears mount over the environmental impact of the agricultural system, entrepreneurs are rushing to develop new ways to feed the planet's growing population. Insects are rich in protein and other essential nutrients and can be reared at scale with minimal environmental impact. The pace of early-stage investments has so far crawled behind that seen in the more glamorous corners of agritech, where start-ups making plant-based and lab-grown meat have attracted venture capital as well as public attention. But the buzz around insects is growing. VC funding to the sector has been creeping up since 2018, with $210m in equity investments last year, according to data group Dealroom. The largest flows have been to startups focused on feeding livestock, fish and pets. InnovaFeed of France, which rears black soldier flies, raised $140m in its latest funding round. It has a strategic partnership with Cargill to supply fish and animal feed, and even processes the flies' manure for use as a fertiliser. Ynsect, another French business that grows molitor and buffalo beetle mealworms used in pet food, fish feed and fertiliser, last year announced a fundraising of more than $350m in equity and debt. Insects can replace grains, soyabeans, seafood and vegetable oils in the pellets fed to animals and fish, providing essential proteins and other nutrients. They can be reared on organic agricultural waste with minimal amounts of water. Rising environmental concerns and ESG investments, as well as recent regulatory approvals, have opened the door to larger-scale funding. But to become a human food source in western markets, insects need to overcome the ""ick factor"". Alex Frederick, agriculture and food analyst at corporate data provider PitchBook, said negative perceptions among consumers in markets that have not traditionally consumed insects were a big barrier to acceptance and growth.    Gorjan Nikolik, analyst at Rabobank, said that if the functional and health benefits of insects were clearly established, they could play ""an important role in food"". However, the bank's latest report on the sector focused solely on non-human consumption of insects. ""We had a lot of our clients saying 'I wouldn't eat it',"" he said. Even though pet food is the largest market for insect protein, some manufacturers refuse to use insects. ""Most people find insects disgusting and some don't want their pets eating them,"" said Nikolik. Rabobank estimates that by 2030, 200,000 tonnes of insects annually will be used in fish feed, or 0.4 per cent of the aquafeed industry, with 150,000 tonnes used in pet food, accounting for 0.5 per cent of the total pet food sector. It expects only about 10,000-20,000 tonnes of insects to be used for human food. But industry insiders believe insects will play a bigger role than some analysts predict. ""More people are starting to think about the consequences of their behaviour,"" said Kees Aarts, founder and chief executive of Dutch insect group Protix. He added that someone talking about sustainability 20 years ago would have been regarded as an anti-capitalist but now ""most young people are thinking about it I'm just blown away how they are looking at every possible solution to help reduce their footprint"". The adverse reaction to insects can be overcome, he believes ""if you deliver tasty products with a lower footprint then consumers will buy them"". Some experts say we may have no choice but to eat insects given the risks climate change, soil erosion, pests and disease pose to the global agricultural system. ""Consumers in the so-called west will have to embrace insects into their diets, to ensure their nutrition remains rich with essential amino acids, proteins, and essential micronutrients such as iron and calcium,"" said Asaf Tzachor, a research associate specialising in food security at the University of Cambridge. The key may be, as with Short-Horn's seasonings, to move away from eating whole insects towards using them as ingredients and additives. Tzachor believes processed insects could be used in products such as pasta, porridge and pancakes to improve their nutritional profile or act as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents. ""Pellets of black soldier fly contain proteins and calcium,"" he said. ""Powder of mealworm beetles contains zinc and essential fatty acids."" Lower volumes of insect-based human food can be offset with higher value and margins, some executives and investors believe. Eric Archambeau of venture capital firm Astanor, an investor in Ynsect, said insects were nutritious and the ease with which insect proteins can be digested meant they could be used in food aimed at elderly and infirm people, who can struggle with mainstream products. With supplements a multibillion-dollar industry, he added, ""these categories are a niche, but they are a very large niche"". Aside from food and feed, researchers are experimenting with other ways of using insects. Some researchers are looking at using insects' anti-bacterial properties to increase food products' shelf life, while others are investigating their potential role in addressing environmental problems, for example by rearing them on waste such as cardboard and plastics. While developing these technologies into scalable operations to work commercially will take time, ""it's the potential that excites people"", said Nikolik. The response to Short-Horn's launch at the start of the year suggests perceptions are changing. ""We've already grown by 20 per cent and we've had repeat customers,"" Wright said. ""People have been really receptive, which has been quite a shock."" 10-20 Thousands of tonnes of insects used for human food by 2030 $140m Amount InnovaFeed raised in its latest funding round Insects can replace grains, soyabeans, seafood and vegetable oils in the pellets fed to animals and fish 'Powder of mealworm beetles contains zinc and essential fatty acids' Asaf Tzachor"
7c1050a3b289455ab0d6,2021-06-04,EU's new rules on sustainability spell trouble for companies,"S olar energy is central to global strategies for a more sustainable future. Yet roughly half of the polysilicon used to build solar panels comes from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, where there are reports of forced labour in the Uyghur community. Low carbon technologies, such as wind turbines and electric vehicles, produce millions of tonnes of toxic e-waste each year, which end up in African or Asian dumps and pose serious health risks. And the explosion in the use of mobile phone batteries has fuelled huge growth in the mining of minerals such as cobalt, which are sourced from supply chains that employ children under appalling conditions. While the world surges forward in the development of green products, the catastrophic human costs and social impacts of those green industries have largely been ignored. Fortunately, the EU has quietly taken a major step towards addressing this blind spot. Two components of the EU's Green Deal the EU Taxonomy and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation now require companies and financial entities to conduct human rights due diligence for any good or service to qualify as ""sustainable"". It is a label that will prove increasingly important to customers, lenders and governments. Under the rules, an economic activity must comply with ""minimum safeguards"" based on UN and OECD human rights principles. Companies will have to ensure that their products or services neither result in nor are linked to harmful effects on people. The sustainable finance regulation, meanwhile, requires financial entities to identify and address any harmful impacts from investment decisions and advice, not only on the environment but now also on people. In this new regulatory context, no matter how ""green"" a product may appear, issues such as the use of child labour in supply chains or the dislocation of indigenous communities will render them ""unsustainable"". Business and finance are neither focused on the new requirements nor ready to integrate them. An exercise conducted last year by the UN revealed surprisingly poor results as only two out of the 35 case studies used the relevant UN and OECD human rights principles to assess alignment with the taxonomy rules. Yet an inability to address the human rights components will be costly. Companies will face legal and financial risks, and possibly sanctions for noncompliance. They will also face reputational risks if they wrongly label activities or products ""sustainable"". Already we have begun to see the effects of ESG concerns on IPOs, intensified focus by investors on human rights risk management, and growing scrutiny of the human rights performance of financial institutions. Companies and financial institutions need to enhance their capacities on human rights. They need at a minimum to develop the skills to conduct due diligence in this area on an ongoing basis; create the governance structures to determine accountability and day-today responsibility; and systematically integrate human rights risks in decision-making. The gilets jaunes movement in France, whose protests against a government fuel tax increase that was meant to curb the use of fossil fuels nearly brought the country to a standstill, has demonstrated the perils of ignoring the social dimension of environmental measures. The Covid-19 pandemic has only further heightened awareness. The Green Deal reflects this realisation. Yet business and finance must play their part by integrating respect for human rights throughout operations. Failure on this front will mean that sorely needed changes for people on the    ground will not occur, and that efforts to ensure a just and inclusive transition to a green economy will be undermined. With that, we all lose.

98e8cebdc6c434237920,2021-06-04,Tiny high-energy hedge fund forced change at ExxonMobil,"Engine No. 1 succeeded in tapping a well of discontent among shareholders It has been depicted as David and Goliath. A tiny hedge fund called Engine No. 1 went up against the mightiest US oil group and won three seats on its board, with a mandate to prepare it for a future free of fossil fuel. With only 22 employees and $240m worth of assets under management, according to a filing, Engine No. 1's letter to the ExxonMobil board on December 7 its activist declaration hardly induced terror at the oil major's Texas headquarters. Media attention focused as much on D.E. Shaw, a hedge fund with $55bn in assets, which launched a shorter-lived campaign for change at the company about the same time. Engine No. 1 was just weeks old, with a stake in the $250bn-market-cap group worth $50m, or about 0.02 per cent. But Engine No. 1 was no fly-by-night outfit. Chris James, its founder and the source of most of its initial capital, is a hedge fund industry veteran who made his fortune as a technology and biotech investor. His other firm, Partner Fund Management, which he founded in 2004, had assets under management of $6bn at its peak, making it one of the biggest hedge funds on the west coast. Partner Fund may be most famous not for its successes but for one of its duds. It put $96m in 2014 into Theranos, the blood-tests group founded by Elizabeth Holmes, before the start-up collapsed following allegations of fraud. Partner Fund sued Theranos for ""fraudulently inducing"" its investment. With Engine No. 1, James is hoping to capitalise on institutional investors' growing interest in backing funds that pursue a positive environmental and social impact. ""We were founded as an impact investment firm,"" he said. ""We have multiple strategies within the firm that we will offer, but the urgency of Exxon, given the scale of its impacts, forced us to introduce the firm through the active engagement strategy."" For Engine No. 1's activism, James tapped another veteran, Charlie Penner. Penner spent 15 years at Jana Partners, one of the best-known activist hedge funds, with experience tackling groups such as Apple and Qualcomm. Penner was lured to Engine No. 1 by the idea of a new firm focused directly on impact investing, not the traditional hedge fund activism of Jana, which often focused on forcing a company to break itself up, put itself up for sale or return cash to shareholders. Before he departed, Penner created a fund called Jana Impact Capital that would focus on trying to improve companies' environmental, social and governance records. The venture would count rock star Sting and his wife Trudie Styler as advisers, and brought in Sister Patricia Daly, a nun and activist who is a familiar face at Exxon shareholder meetings arguing for more disclosure on emissions.    But the fund never really got off the ground. Jana, whose assets had declined from a peak of more than $11bn in 2015 to $1.5bn by the start of 2020, was focused on its own restructuring following investor outflows and years of lacklustre performance. It was a campaign Penner led against Apple in which Jana had teamed up with Calstrs, the second-largest US retirement fund, to call for the iPhone maker to beef up parental controls on devices that prompted James to get in touch. Penner arrived with a reputation and some clout among investors. ""Charlie has been building relationships with people like me all over the Street for over a decade good, good relationships,"" said an executive at a top-20 Exxon shareholder. At Engine No. 1, he called on his contacts at Calstrs, including Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager in the sustainable investment unit at the $300bn retirement fund, who has known Penner for more than a decade, to support the firm's campaign against Exxon. ""Chris James brought the capital to this campaign, Charlie brought his experience as an activist and Calstrs brought the role of a constructive long-term [Exxon] shareholder,"" said Mastagni. Supporters of Exxon's management and Darren Woods, its chief executive, pointed to the link with Calstrs to say Engine No. 1 was a front for the Californian fund as it tried to push a green agenda. Calstrs had voted against the reelection of all Exxon's board in 2020. Penner said: ""Engine No. 1 has its own capital and Calstrs is supportive of changing underperforming companies like Exxon. That's the story. They wanted to create an impression that we're saying, 'Shut off the oil and gas pipes and start putting solar panels up on the roof'. ""What we're saying is, 'Look, there's going to be an industry transition. It may take 10, 20, 30 years.'"" Exxon responded to the pressure with its own initiatives, from new emissions reduction targets to the creation of a low-carbon business. It appointed new directors, including Jeff Ubben, another activist hedge fund manager who has drifted into ESG investing. The changes were enough to satisfy D.E. Shaw, which ended its activist stance in March. Engine No. 1, however, tapped a well of discontent among Exxon shareholders, arguing in an 80-page presentation that the group's climate approach and its financial underperformance were part of a whole, and only deep changes to the board and strategy would fix it. The final vote tally from Exxon's annual meeting last week was confirmed on Wednesday. As well as former refining executives Gregory Goff and Kaisa Hietala, whose election was announced on the day, Engine No. 1 secured a seat for a third nominee, venture capital investor Alexander Karsner. Another verdict of sorts could come later this year, since Engine No 1 intends to raise money from institutional investors to amplify the cash put in by James. It has also filed to launch an exchangetraded fund to attract retail investors. James and Penner declined to comment on the fundraising. As for its next campaign, the pair are not yet tipping their hand. Engine No. 1 has taken small positions in other companies including farm equipment maker John Deere and commodities trader Bunge. The firm was looking for more ""structural change opportunities"", Penner said. ""We have a couple of things in the hopper."" The activist declared that the climate approach and underperformance were part of a whole"
dfa91322d28005e2dc96,2021-06-03,Corporate emissions: the heat is on,"Twitter: @FTLex World leaders find it hard enough to agree on the existential threat of climate change. More heat will be generated by a push for listed companies to disclose the financial risks better. France's central bank governor, François Villeroy de Galhau, says governments are close to agreeing a plan even so. High time. Companies report their emissions in ways that defeat comparisons. Few quantify financial risks from climate change at all. The rapid rise of ESG means investors need better data. Inflows to ESG funds ran at $2bn a day in the first quarter. Many companies now report their carbon dioxide and other emissions. Some even disclose internal assumptions on carbon pricing. Under the EU's Emission Trading System, the December 2021 price already exceeds €50 per tonne, up 62 per cent this year. BP has assumed €100 internally for 2030. Few forecast this far ahead. They do not have to. Most financial directors prepare accounts as the law and the whims of the board dictate. Two bodies should give direction to governments and company number crunchers. Outside the US, that falls to the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation. It has just set up a sustainability standards board. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission oversees disclosure. Disappointingly, given the US's leadership role in world financial markets, the SEC has moved slowly on carbon and other ESG issues. What should standards look like? Companies should disclose both their expected emissions and an assumed long-term carbon price within the scope of international averages. From that, the present cost of pollution should be calculated and stated. The European Commission has plans for tariffs that would eliminate the price advantage cheap imports owed to low or absent carbon taxes. This is a sign that a global carbon price is in the offing. Lex research points to a realistic current world price of €100 per tonne. Alarmingly for high-carbon sectors such as steel and cement, the cost of annual CO2 emissions at this price is equivalent to a typical year's ebitda. Eco warriors and climate change sceptics alike quibble that different assumptions produce varying risks and mitigation costs. Governments and standards bodies should nail down central cases for both. Most businesses would swiftly follow their lead."
e4ab43676c0b5609f0d9,2021-06-02,Investor pay revolts really need to get personal,"W ho is responsible when pay goes wrong? You wouldn't always know by looking at the results of shareholder votes on the matter. The messy business of the UK AGM season is well under way. Against the backdrop of the pandemic and a clamouring for executives to share in the pain of employees and shareholders, this counts as a pretty bad-tempered pay round. Yet it still feels like a slightly odd dance, one where investors sometimes find places to register their disapproval but in a way that doesn't risk upsetting anyone too much. Just look at the willingness to vote against reports on executive pay, and the apparent reluctance to vote against the individuals in charge of making the decisions. This year we've had what counts as a big revolt at Rio Tinto, whose pay report was rejected by 62 per cent of shareholders that voted but whose remuneration committee chair Sam Laidlaw was re-elected with 95 per cent of the vote. Pay reports at the London Stock Exchange and BAE Systems were rejected by about 23 per cent of voters but the boards, including those charged with overseeing pay, came through with nothing like that level of dissent. For companies that have faced a revolt on their pay report this year, defined as at least 20 per cent opposition, less than a fifth also faced similar pushback to at least one director, according to Proxy Insight. Tom Powdrill, head of stewardship at proxy adviser Pirc, reckons that the average asset manager might vote against 10-20 per cent of UK remuneration reports, although a few now object to significantly more. But votes against directors are less common, he says, perhaps below 5 per cent. Some groups remain wary of voting against individuals on any grounds. Rewind a few years and most UK institutions took that view, either out of a sense of propriety or excessive politeness. Significant votes against pay at places such as BP or WPP were accompanied by board results that implied blind loyalty to directors or their practical irrelevance to the objectionable outcome. Companies then used the result to downplay the extent of investor dissatisfaction. Move along, everyone. Nothing to see. Now there is an emerging but minority view that, as one stewardship head puts it, ""personal accountability is vital if we wish to see change"". This isn't always easy, not least at Aston Martin where voting against the remuneration committee chair would have meant a vote against the only female board member. Investors were exercised about the lack of diversity, as well as executive pay. Advocates acknowledge this is a qualitative call, based in part on how well the company has handled an issue. Some investors are reluctant to penalise individuals in what they see as one-off or idiosyncratic situations (which amounts to a pass for bad decision-making). But everyone could benefit if the default policy was accountability, with exceptions clearly explained. Blackrock's policy, for example, is to vote against the relevant directors where it has concerns. But this year it backed Rio's Laidlaw because (rightly or wrongly) it said it recognised the legal constraints facing the board.    AstraZeneca's remuneration chair escaped unscathed, despite a 40 per cent vote against its second new paypolicy in two years, perhaps becausehe was new in the job. But anotherdirector overseeing pay did suffer a smaller but sizeable vote against. No one wants to lose good board members and director votes, unlike pay reports, are binding. But the prospect of meaningful rebuke should strengthen boards' hands in talks with hard-charging chief executives. Reluctance to carry pay angst to its logical conclusion lays investors open to the accusation that they blindly follow proxy advisory firms such as ISS, which themselves tend to be a little gun-shy in advising votes against directors. The more damning charge is that voting only against the pay report looks an easy but largely empty protest: a good signal to send, to customers and ESG enthusiasts as well as the company, but one unlikely to cause too much trouble. Most pay debates boil down to board judgment. Where investors believe that the pay is unacceptable but the judgment of those in charge was fine, they should explain why. Where they really think pay is a problem, it's time to get more personal. helen.thomas@ft.com Everyone could benefit if the default policy was accountability, with exceptions explained"
01b30b8422f398fa0768,2021-06-01,ESG funds: sustainable future,"Twitter: @FTLex Money continues to flow into ESG funds, which are especially popular in Europe. However, companies across the board are putting more focus on sustainable themes, with the topic receiving an increasing number of mentions in earnings calls. ESG funds have proved they can survive and even thrive in a crisis. Some $2bn a day flowed into sustainable funds in the first quarter of this year, according to Morningstar. That was half of all European fund flows into the sector. But as investors ramp up calls for sustainability at every company, and regulators set more targets for eliminating emissions, ESG has a finite future as a discrete category. It is not hard to imagine a time when these specialist funds will be redundant. Last week, activists showed they could push back against fossil fuel producers without the help of ESG investors. Shareholders shook up ExxonMobil's board of directors and forced fellow US oil major Chevron to consider reducing its scope 3 emissions, or those from the products it produces. Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell meanwhile was ordered by a court in the Netherlands to increase its emissions cuts, a ruling that could set a global precedent. A swath of investors and activists are calling time on global polluters. They include Chris Hohn's Say on Climate and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The latter is chaired by Michael Bloomberg and backed by supporters with an aggregate market cap of $23tn. Yet the push for corporate sustainability and transparency on meeting targets has not rendered ESGthemed funds redundant quite yet. For one, managers running funds that are not ESG specific are limited in the ground they can cover. BlackRock discovered as much when it took the high ground against Procter & Gamble over the consumer product giant's sourcing of palm oil from an Indonesian company in which it also held a stake. The investment industry is split over how to proceed. Institutional investors hold sway over the companies they partially own but are not best placed to set targets or plot paths towards decarbonisation. There is also no standardisation across countries, which hobbles corporate compliance. Investors who want to play by the sustainable book will have to hang on to those ESG labels for a while yet."
cd6d3325284517c35c61,2021-05-27,Companies grapple with indirect emissions,"Scope 3 Supply chains and product use make calculating climate impact a tricky task, writes Leslie Hook M easuring emissions is sometimes like measuring calories in a diet there is a touch of art along with the science. And, for companies, it is most difficult to be purely scientific over indirect, or ""Scope 3"", emissions the greenhouse gases emitted all along their supply chains and in the use of their products. Think of Carlsberg selling a beer: its direct emissions come from its buildings, electricity and business travel. But its Scope 3 emissions cover all the steps to get the beer into the hand of the customer such as purchasing barley, buying cans and transporting the bottled beverage. Carlsberg calls these its ""beer-in-hand"" emissions, and they represent more than 10 times its direct emissions from breweries. That multiple is not unusual Scope 3 emissions are typically the biggest part of a company's carbon footprint and the hardest to measure. Yet, despite the challenges, more companies are trying to do so. ""You can't really develop a decent climate change strategy unless you've looked at Scope 3,"" says Tom Cumberlege, associate director at the Carbon Trust, a London-based nonprofit climate consultancy. ""Scope 3 is so crucial to all forms of climate change activity."" In the past, companies tended to focus more on direct emissions, such as from their offices, cars and business travel but that is no longer enough. ""Business travel is usually fairly insignificant compared to value chain emissions,"" Cumberlege says. As more companies start to target net zero emissions, the importance of Scope 3 has grown, because a net zero target must include these indirect emissions. ""You can't avoid Scope 3 today,"" says Rachel Delacour, co-founder at Sweep, a carbon management software start-up. ""The large companies using our product, it is because they have pressure over their Scope 3."" The definition of Scope 3 emissions is laid out by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a joint initiative of World Resources Institute and WBCSD with the aim of keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees celsius. It specifies 15 categories, including purchased goods, waste generated, fuel-related activi- ties, use of sold products, investments, franchises and employee commuting. For large companies, it is therefore a significant organisational challenge to track down all these figures. ""There is a lot of data to collect, which can be daunting,"" says Cumberlege. ""There is some uncertainty around how you could measure it ... and most of these are, by definition, outside the influence of the business that is doing the reporting."" Companies ""don't necessarily know how to reduce in those sectors"". Asking suppliers to cut the emissions of the products they supply is often one step in the process. For Carlsberg which aims to reduce its ""beer-inhand"" emissions by 15 per cent by 2022, compared with 2015 levels that meant working with its packaging suppliers.    Packaging including cans and bottles accounts for 41 per cent of Carlsberg's ""beerin-hand"" emissions. But, after two of its can suppliers, Ball and Crown, starting buying more renewable energy, that figure has begun to fall. This knock-on effect as companies with climate targets ask their suppliers to cut emissions is one reason measuring Scope 3 emissions is a powerful exercise. The Scope 3 emissions of one company will be the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of another. Investors are also turning to Scope 3 estimates as they try to understand the risks companies will face from rising carbon prices and more stringent national emissions policies. Oliver Marchand, head of ESG research at securities index publisher MSCI, explains how his team recently developed a model that estimates Scope 3 emissions for about 9,000 companies. ""The biggest risk comes from the value chain risk embedded in buying stuff that is carbon intensive,"" he says. His new database of Scope 3 estimates allows investors to get a more holistic picture of a company's exposure to changing climate policies. ""There are certain industries that are major contributors to climate change like oil companies, car manufacturers, banks and they have very low [emissions numbers] if you just look at Scope 1 and 2,"" says Marchand. ""It is a completely false analysis, and you don't have to be a genius to see that in the data. ""Now, the risk models correctly calculate the difference between a traditional car manufacturer, like Volkswagen, and Tesla, because of the difference in their Scope 3 emissions,"" he says. For carmakers, Scope 3 emissions include those from the vehicles that they produce. There is still uncertainty in pinpointing precise figures for Scope 3 estimates. If different firms were auditing Scope 3 emissions for the same company, they would probably come up with slightly different numbers, Cumberlege says. One question is how many steps down the value chain to go. Another challenge is making estimates for suppliers that do not already calculate their own emissions. Help may be on the way, though. New technologies such as satellite imagery can help measure emissions at their source. And digital technologies and digitised supply chain management mean emissions data will become more robust. Marchand envisions a world with ""massive distribution of IoT [internet of things] devices that measure carbon dioxide for all sorts of facilities and machinery"", and thinks that may not be far away. Scope 3 emissions may be tricky to measure now, he says, but it will get easier. 'You can't develop a decent climate strategy unless you look at Scope 3'"

But it has turned into a pandemic-induced existential career crisis. I have pursued various openings but cannot decide which route to take. Should I join London's Metropolitan Police as a detective, teach maths in an underprivileged comprehensive, pursue more consulting opportunities advising on ESG, or move to America and become an orchard keeper? (I do already own one from when I previously lived there.) Male, 40s Jonathan's answer The great pause of the pandemic provided an environment that has allowed you to take stock. It seems also to have inspired you to think freely and explore a wide range of possibilities. Faced with almost too much choice, you wonder what can help you make the decision. Research by Sheena Iyengar, professor of business at New York's Columbia University, and Mark Lepper, a psychology professor at Stanford, showed that when shoppers are presented with overwhelming choice, they do not make a decision at all. In a supermarket experiment, when shoppers were offered a tasting array of 24 varieties of jam, only 3 per cent went on to buy some with the money-off coupons they were given. When the tasting array was reduced to just six, 30 per cent of shoppers bought some jam with their coupons. While there has been debate over the findings, narrowing your number of job choices is likely to help you make a decision. Do this by limiting certain elements such as location, salary, skills and qualifications needed to succeed. Your existential crisis may have provoked challenging questions about your purpose, what is important to you, and what brings value to your life. All four choices of job that you mention have a common theme of service, being valued, and producing something you consider worthwhile, whether it's solving crimes or growing fruit. If you further define any other underlying motivators you find valuable, it will give you a set of filters to assess your options. You may even find other options that fit the bill. Which of your current choices will give you the most purpose and satisfaction, pay sufficiently well, and is the most likely to be successful? Check how anyone else in your life is going to be affected by the choice you make. You may find discussing your options with a coach or mentor will help crystallise your thinking. When you answer that most difficult question, ""what do I want?"" perhaps the best answer will be a role in which you will be most valued by others; arguably the most important factor in giving meaning to life. Readers' advice ESG consulting has the twin benefits of both being viable and already familiar to you. Even if it is not something you can see yourself doing long term, it can provide you with an income while you get your ideas better sorted out. Koba Best technique by far on this is: 1) Remove yourself from your day to day frenetic thoughts; 2) Calmly think forward five years what do you want it to look like on work/life balance, interest, stress levels, income, status, and so on.

None of the career paths you mention seem unattainable. bulldog2015 Next problem I am a management consultant with a focus on operations and I would like to use this experience to move towards a chief operations officer role. Since typically only partners can exit and move directly into C-suite roles my best route would be to become an operations executive in a company and work my way up.

3da00624aeedc1470062,2021-05-24,The currency of sustainable success,"A t a time when any business can go from being relevant to being sidelined based solely on its perceived contribution to society, companies are looking to define clearly their new ""corporate currency"". Today's stakeholders want to be associated with organisations that have strong sense of purpose and contribute to societal wellness and the common good. Importantly, an organisation's purpose must be reinforced by its culture which, in turn, is influenced heavily by the behaviour of its leaders. It is the company's culture that determines the level of inclusion employees feel and directly shapes the employee experience, both of which influence the wellbeing of the workforce. These factors then shape how customers experience the company ? which has an effect on how stakeholders of all types perceive and talk about the organisation. This is what becomes the organisation's brand. The strength and alignment of these factors provide a powerful and accurate proxy for any organisation's ability to achieve sustainable success. ""A company can only achieve greatness if its purpose, culture and brand are in sync,"" says Joan Amble, a former finance chief at American Express and now a board member at Zurich Insurance, radio group SiriusXM and consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. ""If any one of those elements is not, the corporation's currency can be devalued instantly. Regaining that value can take years, and in some instances companies never recover. Getting this right, and having the ability to monitor the pulse of the organisation on all fronts, is an imperative that requires vigilance, constant measurement and engaged ownership by all."" Amble's sentiment is perhaps best summed up by Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, who at the 2017 FinTech Ideas Festival said: ""Being CEO has taught me this ? that two things perhaps matter the most: having a very clear sense of purpose or mission that gives the organisation real direction, and having a culture that allows you to go after that mission."" This is reinforced in recent research by the Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp), a human capital research company, in partnership with Extraordinary Women on Boards, a community of female directors representing hundreds of public and private company boards. They asked 137 women board directors to identify the workforce-related data they do not currently see but would find highly valuable. Among the most cited were data about the company's reputation as an employer, its level of employee advocacy and the health of its culture. ""Board directors are always trying to see around corners and manage risk,"" says Lisa Shalett, co-founder of Extraordinary Women on Boards. ""They want to understand whether the company is doing what it says it is, what the culture really is.    These kinds of data points could indicate the presence or absence of trust among key stakeholders."" Trust is one of the primary derivatives of a strong corporate currency. Given the dramatic health and wellbeing challenges brought on by the pandemic, as well as the emergence of new work models and faster digitisation, the data relating to a company's purpose, culture and brand are important signals to watch. Measuring this new corporate currency can be difficult, though. Agreement on what to measure, access to different types of data, and the level of analytical sophistication will vary by company. Critical, however, is understanding the sentiment of stakeholders, especially that of the workforce. Increasingly, company boards are waking up to the importance of governing these elements rigorously, and investors are calling for evidence of this. All of which will surely continue, given the heightened emphasis now placed on a company's commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) ? which often includes metrics specific to company purpose and culture. Managing a company's corporate currency is not just the responsibility of those at the top, says Amble. ""As companies and boards think about their corporate currency, it will be important to consider whether there is a clear understanding of the role of each employee in the organisation ? those in the first, second and third lines of defence ? from those who set policy and procedures, to those who direct the actions and processes, and those who ensure they are operating as intended."" Critical stakeholders realise that the new corporate currency is both a riskmitigation tool ? to prevent the organisation from being the next alarming headline ? and an execution tool for future success. Kevin Martin is chief research officer at the Institute for Corporate Productivity Corporate currency The data needed to come to a valuation The new 'corporate currency' has three elements: an organisation's purpose (why it does what it does); its culture (what stakeholders experience while working with it); and its brand (its reputation as a place to work, a provider of products and services, an investment vehicle and a steward of the environment). Bigger organisations use multiple methods to monitor the alignment and strength of their corporate currency. As a minimum, organisations should track, measure and analyse the following data: Purpose indicators Asking employees if they ""agree/disagree"" with these two statements will reveal whether the organisation's purpose resonates with them: ? ""This organisation cares about its impact on society as well as making money""; ? ""I believe what this organisation does is important and meaningful"". Culture indicators ? Retention rate of critical talent; ? Internal sentiment among employees, culled from staff surveys, internal message boards and interviews; ? Inclusion ? a measure that could include the percentage of women in management roles and the percentage of successor candidates selected from underrepresented groups, as well as the rate of diverse talent movement across and upwards in the organisation, compared with all employees. Brand indicators ? Sentiment posted on employer review platforms, such as Glassdoor's ratings, or on social media platforms, such as Facebook; ? Employee net promoter score (ie, employee advocacy score or percentage of current and exiting employees who would recommend the organisation as a good place to work); ? Customer net promoter score (ie, customer advocacy score or assessment of customers' overall relationship with the organisation)."
8bff046bfc828bbcc9c0,2021-05-24,Collaboration is crucial if businesses and society are to thrive,"T he plight of companies in 2021 has been to contend with two difficulties. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic last year, some economies were already in a weak state. But the restrictions since imposed by governments to stop the spread of the virus have only made matters worse. In the early stages of the pandemic, I coined the term ""coronanomics"", to reflect how the economic and health crises were intertwined. Companies have been in survival mode and boards of directors around the world are only thinking short term about how to avoid the liquidation of their businesses. If a company were to be liquidated at this time, the sale of tangible assets would not achieve market value and human capital would be dispersed. When we arrive at population immunity through global vaccination, economies will go back into thriving mode. For now, though, directors' mindset must be one of integration, collaboration and compromise, and they must act accordingly in their relationship with stakeholders. Company directors have to understand the needs, interests and expectations of stakeholders and the hardships they have suffered during coronanomics. Likewise, stakeholders need to consider the challenges companies have had to deal with. That is why the global economic, social and environmental objectives set by the UN have become so important. Among the 17 sustainable development goals agreed by world leaders in 2015 is one concerning partnerships. That drove the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines and such collaboration between stakeholders and companies is essential while economies are in survival mode. A board, however, cannot ignore its duty to think long term. In this regard, the two critical risks are climate change and cyber security. Directors have to build them into their business models and strategies for the longer term, for when economies regain momentum. At least, finally, the framework providers for economic, social and governance (ESG) standards are collaborating after years of seeing one another as competitors. That had been an outrage because they were all dealing with improving outcomes for society, by making corporate reporting more informed, and accountability more transparent. Now, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation has agreed to expand its mandate to include sustainability issues and create an International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) alongside the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). This will give ESG standards the same reliability, consistency and rigour as the IASB financial standards, which are applicable in 144 jurisdictions around the world. The IFRS does not have to reinvent the wheel but it can draw lessons from these collaborating framework providers in establishing sustainability reporting standards for the 144 jurisdictions. Sustainability has two sides to it. First, there are the effects of a company's activities, products or services on the three critical dimensions for sustainable development: the economy, society and the environment. Then, there are    the effects of those dimensions on companies for example, the pandemic's economic and social impact is felt by businesses, as is climate change. There is every indication ISSB standards will look through a valuecreation lens: namely, the effects of those three critical dimensions on a company. At the same time, if a company wants to report on sustainability issues to show the effects of its activities on those three critical dimensions, it could use the Global Reporting Initiative standards. Company reporting used to focus on financial aspects under the doctrine of shareholder primacy, but, over the past two decades, it has looked more at enterprise value creation, preservation or erosion. Company governance also needs to change from a mindless checklistbased operation to a mindful outcomes-based approach, in line with integrated or strategic reporting, as it is known in the UK. The sustainable development goals are also outcomes-based for example, clean water, clean production and quality education. In corporate governance, the four critical outcomes that external stakeholders should see are: ethical culture with effective leadership; trust and confidence in the company by the community where the company operates; adequate and effective controls inside the company; and value creation in a sustainable manner. If stakeholders' rational conclusion is that a company is achieving those four outcomes, the company can be said to be practising quality governance. Effective leadership means that directors, individually and collectively, acknowledge that they represent a company's conscience. A company, as an artificial entity, can have no conscience itself. When something goes wrong, therefore, society should direct its wrath at corporate leaders, rather than companies. Just as corporate thinking has shifted from the primacy of the shareholder to enterprise value creation for the long-term health of the company, an outcomes-based approach to corporate governance would be in the long-term interests of all stakeholders.

4193ee899b6653a69bd6,2021-05-24,The search for the meaning of green,"Analytics A lack of definitions and data is a sizeable obstacle to sustainable investing, though legislators are making progress, writes Silvia Pavoni Coming up with accurate data on companies' environmental, social and governance records has always been difficult for investors. Demand for so-called ESG funds may be high, but understanding where the green capital should flow is not always obvious. The problem is most often a lack of meaningful, reliable data. ""At the moment, the risk is that it is 'garbage in, garbage out',"" says Bernard de Longevialle, global head of sustainable finance at S&P Global Ratings. Others agree. According to a 2020 BlackRock survey of 425 investors across the world together representing $25tn in assets under management poor quality or unavailable ESG data and analytics represent the biggest obstacle to sustainable investing. The EU has now set out to rectify matters. Through a mushrooming array of rules and directives, the bloc is seeking to pin down what can be called a sustainable investment in its member states, as well as providing clearer reporting standards although experts warn that initial results may be patchy. The centrepiece of Brussels' sustainability legislation is a taxonomy that defines what is green. While it has been in force since last summer, its disclosure requirements will only kick in next year. In the meantime, the debate continues over certain technical elements, as well as the various shades of green and what can be termed sustainable. A case in point is the EU's ongoing assessment of nuclear energy's place in the taxonomy. As Thomas Buberl, chief executive of insurer Axa, put it at the FT's Global Boardroom event earlier this month: ""When you look at nuclear today, [it] is clearly a technology that would fall more into the olive bucket than into the brown or black buckets"". There are also issues about how classifications apply to different industries. Utility and powergeneration companies, for example, appear to be more comfortable with the EU definitions because their activities are more clearly defined by the taxonomy, says one investment professional. But, for others, ""like chemical companies, the message we get is that they still find it hard to match the taxonomy [definitions]"", he says. ""The differences between companies are striking."" The taxonomy sets four overarching conditions that an economic activity must meet to qualify as sustainable. It must, for example, contribute to at least one of six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Another of the conditions is that an activity must ""do no significant harm"" to any of the other environmental objectives. But this is where scrutiny becomes particularly tricky, say investors, as companies' internal systems are not built to collect this kind of data.    Backing business activities that fall outside the taxonomy will have implications for investment products, as they cannot be labelled sustainable if they fail to meet the EU definitions. Companies will therefore have to use the same definitions in their sustainability disclosures. All of this comes as asset managers and advisers are already dealing with the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which came into effect in March. It adds to existing investment regulations such as the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive, or Ucits. Under SFDR, financial companies are required to manage the sustainability risks of their activities and the impact those activities have on the environment and on people. This ""double materiality"" approach is also taken by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which covers all large companies and listed smaller businesses in the EU. It is currently going through the European legislative process. There is hope that the double materiality principle will force companies to rethink governance structures so that sustainability is not treated just as a compliance matter. Åse Bergstedt, a specialist adviser who until last year was chief sustainability officer at private equity firm International Capital Improved, takes issue with how companies often hand the sustainability task to someone who is not in a position to influence business strategy. She says treating sustainability as an integral part of companies' future is essential because ""what is green now is not going to be green in five years"". Corporate sustainability rules will also be accompanied by a new, specific reporting framework. This may represent a turning point. On the one hand, the EU mandatory framework would fix the data mismatch caused by a proliferation of existing voluntary reporting standards. On the other, it risks adding to the already thick alphabet soup of sustainability disclosures TCFD, SASB, GRI and CDSB being among the main ingredients. The EU says its framework, which would not come into force before 2024, will incorporate the main elements of the others. It will also need to consider the work of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which is studying how to embed sustainability factors into its widely-adopted accounting rules. Besides industry bodies, other jurisdictions, such as the UK, are considering green taxonomies and disclosure requirements on financial services firms. Timothée Jaulin, head of ESG development and advocacy at asset manager Amundi, thinks the EU's sustainable regulation package will become the international ""benchmark"" for those efforts. And the fact that so many are trying to tackle the sustainability data issue proves how much is at stake, reckons S&P's de Longevialle. ""What's happening at the moment, in terms of the need to develop more comprehensive and standardised disclosures, [is] the mother of all battles,"" he says. 'When you look at nuclear, it is a technology that would fall more into the olive bucket than the brown or black buckets'"

3d65fbe870918c747a25,2021-05-24,Korean worker safety in investors' blind spot,"Financial institutions accused of hypocrisy on ESG by ignoring industrial accidents, writes Song Jung-a In February, a 35-year-old subcontractor was killed in the process of replacing a conveyor roller at a Posco steelworks in Pohang, South Korea. A month later, a 56-year-old subcontractor of Posco Chemical, an affiliate company, lost his life at the same plant in a similar incident. These are just the latest in a string of fatal accidents at Posco, which has come under fire for the death toll at its facilities. Last November, three workers were killed in an explosion near a blast furnace at Posco's Gwangyang steelworks. In total, 14 workers have died in three years. ""We are now reluctant to touch a gas valve in the oxygen plant because of explosion risks,"" says JS Choi, a Posco union member at the Gwang- yang steelworks. ""We hope the company will pay more attention to workers' safety."" The frequent industrial accidents prompted Seoul's labour ministry to conduct a twomonth inspection of the Pohang steelworks in February. It found 225 breaches of safety rules, for which the steelmaker was fined Won443m ($395,000). Posco is not alone. Similar problems can be found across corporate Korea, with leading manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Heavy Industries involved in disputes over worker health and safety. South Korea has one of the highest industrial death rates in the developed world, with more than 2,000 work-related fatalities reported last year, according to the country's labour ministry. But, while politicians now regard this as a serious governance problem for Asia's fourthlargest economy, it was tolerated during the country's rapid economic development and is still largely ignored by institutional investors. When he was grilled by lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing in February, Choi Jeong-woo, Posco's chair, apologised for the series of fatal accidents and vowed to make worker safety a top priority. The company is investing an additional Won1tn by 2023 to replace ageing facilities and improve the safety of working environments, having spent Won1.3tn on such efforts over the past three years. ""The deaths of more than 40 workers at Posco [and its construction affiliate] over the past five years is a structural manslaughter stemming from the company's insensitivity to workers' safety,"" says ruling Democratic party politician Noh Woong-rae. ""A slap on the wrist has made Posco a kingdom of industrial disasters."" However, there are few signs of pressure from investors to improve dangerous working environments, despite their growing emphasis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. Posco's share price is up about 40 per cent in the year to date as steel prices have risen amid a global economic recovery. Choi was able to renew his three-year term as chair in March despite the deaths, because South    Korea's staterun National Pension Service, Posco's largest shareholder, with an 11 per cent stake, did not oppose his re-election. In another example that has exposed ESG investors to charges of hypocrisy, Coupang a leading South Korean ecommerce player, which has faced controversy over a series of work-related deaths at its warehouses made a successful stock market debut in New York in March. It reached a valuation of $84bn, backed by investors such as SoftBank, BlackRock and Sequoia. Coupang vehemently denies responsibility for the deaths. ""It is a shame that investors are ignoring the labour problems, although this is corporate Korea's most urgent and important issue,"" says Park Yoo-kyung, an adviser at APG Asset Management in Hong Kong. ""The frequent industrial accidents are a dilemma for the manufacturing-driven country, which is no longer a developing economy."" Coupang says ESG issues are ""critical"" to its business and it continues to measure itself against others in the sector, in a bid to fulfil ESG criteria. It is also ""committed to being the employer of choice in South Korea"", as it aims to create 50,000 new jobs by 2025. Asset managers say that they take worker safety issues seriously, too. BlackRock says it expects ""companies to mitigate adverse impacts to people that could arise from their business practices"" and continues to engage companies ""to ensure consistent board oversight, due diligence, and remediation of any adverse impacts to their employees"". But activists find that many investors in Asia still tend to focus on financial metrics even though non-financial factors, such as labour problems, should be a key consideration for ESG investing. ""Even socially responsible investment funds are reluctant to put pressure on companies over their labour practices, thinking that this does not affect their investment returns,"" says Chae Ibae, a corporate governance expert and former lawmaker. ""This is a major long-term investment risk for Korean companies as they can't generate sustainable profits unless workers' safety is guaranteed."" Kang Eun-mi, a politician with the progressive Justice party, expects a new labour law to drive change. Under this new law, which takes effect next year, business owners or senior executives will face at least a year in jail or a fine of up to Won1bn if they are found to have been negligent in enforcing safety measures when a fatal industrial accident has occurred. Kang also plans to push the National Pension Service to use its shareholder power to put pressure on companies with dangerous working practices."
1a32064a62206bedc697,2021-05-24,Young voices grow louder in company strategies and values,"Recruitment Millennials and Generation Z, as employees and stakeholders, are a growing force in corporate sustainability. By Amy Bell M atts Johansen spent much of his youth in Norway skateboarding: learning tricks and how to take risks. And they are skills he has brought to his role as chief executive of fishing and biotech company Aker BioMarine. ""The only way to progress as a skateboarder is to try things you haven't done before and develop,"" he explains. ""I try to bring that into business. As a skateboarder, your 'equity' is your body and failing means pain, so you learn to balance the risks, and do what you can to maximise success."" Johansen's non-traditional path into corporate life means he often looks beyond formal experience when hiring. He likes to give people of different ages and backgrounds who can ""think fresh and think differently"" responsibility for key parts of business strategy. As these younger generations move up through the workforce everywhere, they will inevitably have a growing influence on how companies are run. Forward-thinking leaders, therefore, are paying attention to how young people think, and what they set as goals or aspirations. At Aker BioMarine, a strategic focus on sustainability is driven by younger employees, for whom environmental and social purpose is a priority, says Johansen. ""Younger people can be better at challenging the status quo,"" he says. ""There are many changes in society that companies have to adapt to. We see an increased focus on sustainability where the younger generation has become a driving force for innovative solutions."" When Aker BioMarine's recent recruits were surveyed, twothirds said the main reason why they chose the company was its strong purpose, which is ""to improve human and planetary health"". In practice, this means embracing new technology and making sustainable choices. Kate Bragg, a millennial herself, works in renewable energy strategy and was most recently a vice-president at Norwegian renewables company Statkraft. ""Work is more than work for lots of millennials and the mission statement of a company matters a lot to their own identity and how they see themselves in the world,"" she says. This puts the onus on companies to think about how they recruit and retain younger cohorts, which can include millennials (25 to 40 years old) and Generation Z (aged 11-24). Millennials are now starting to move into more senior positions. ""They are a group that want to change jobs every two to three years; they want to be challenged, to go and have different experiences,"" says Bragg. She says that, to retain them, companies must go beyond mission statements and practise what they preach. ""The upside of purpose-driven millennials is that they are very focused, talented and passionate,"" she says. ""But if you have promised them an environment where their voice will be heard, you need to give them this or be prepared for them to leave."" Offering development opportunities and mobility throughout the organisation will be crucial, says Bragg, as well as ensuring younger employees understand the context of their roles.    For leaders like Johansen, a commitment to responsible business values is fundamental for attracting and retaining younger talent. ""As a CEO, it's not that I'm that purpose-driven, it's just that I believe it is good for business,"" he says. ""The difference between me and the younger generation coming in is that they genuinely care about the purpose. If you don't have a strong purpose and clear meaning of what the company is doing, you're not going to be able to get those talents and keep them."" Younger employees taking an interest in a company's values can only be a positive thing, says Danielle Harmer, chief people officer at UK insurance company Aviva. ""It's fabulous that young people, at the start of their careers, are so aware of and discerning about the long-term aims and responsibilities of their employer,"" she says. ""We encourage our graduate community to get fully involved in our sustainability agenda. As part of their programme, our graduates form teams for the Aviva sustainability challenge to create solutions for our customers, communities and the climate."" ""Companies want to create value,"" says Kiran Aziz, senior impact investment analyst at KLP Asset Management in Norway. ""But this value can no longer be gained if ethical, environmental and social goals are not being taken into consideration."" This recognition that organisations have obligations not just to shareholders but to stakeholders including customers, employees, suppliers and communities is growing. It is these stakeholders who have been pushing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues to the fore. A ziz says ""This has been driven by increased social, governmental and consumer attention on the broader impact corporations have, as well as by institutional investors embracing the notion a strong ESG focus can safeguard a company's long-term success."" At Aker BioMarine, Johansen notes that ""A lot of this [younger] generation are now coming into decisionmaking positions and as customers, suppliers, and in society in general, [where they are] starting to influence on that side as well."" In the short term, Bragg says that, as consumers, young people already influence companies' products and what they invest in citing Tesla's decision to stop accepting bitcoin on fossil-fuel usage grounds and Amazon becoming the biggest user of renewable power in the world. For all companies, then, sustainability values cannot be a priority only when times are good, says Bragg. ""For example, when oil companies experience a drop in oil prices, if the first thing they do is cut their renewables focus, then current and future employees will know these companies are not serious about their sustainable agenda,"" she says. Honesty about the trade-offs is crucial, Bragg adds. In renewable energy, there are ""huge societal gains from a climate perspective, but there are many unanswered questions on biodiversity, which responsible companies need to continue to grapple with"". This is an opportunity, though: ""Use your purpose-driven employees to help solve these things,"" she says. If organisations can harness the drive of younger employees to generate growth, it could be a win-win for everyone, Bragg believes. ""There are a bunch of problems we need to solve in society, and Generation Z and millennials are probably the group with the most momentum to do this. We need to help them achieve that."" For Nigyar Makhmudova, chief growth officer at French food group Danone, having agile teams in which projects are led by the most expert, not the most senior, person is one way to harness the enthusiasm of younger generations. ""We all know millennials are attracted by ability to get diverse and multiple experiences,"" she says. ""Since many of those challenges involve sustainability and increasing our online presence, younger people are often best equipped to tackle these challenges."" This mobilises young voices while also accelerating their learning and development, argues Makhmudova. Ultimately, says Bragg, it comes down to capturing the drive of younger employees in a way that creates value for the business. ""It's making sure there is a balance between growth and profitability, and that you bring the two together. Then you really are on to something winning in terms of purpose."" 'The mission statement of a company matters a lot to millennials' own identity and how they see themselves in the world'"
afe04946a6d055ba3115,2021-05-22,Attacks on the pay of top-performing CEOs can backfire,"Institutional investors are busy protesting against executive pay. In the US, pay packages at public companies have received their lowest approval levels since votes became mandatory 10 years ago. In the UK, the average proportion of No votes has reached its highest level in at least seven years. Pay revolts are very much in keeping with the ESG zeitgeist. And disinterested observers can be pleased there is resistance to chief executives earning massive multiples of average wages at a time of global suffering. But investors are not disinterested observers. Their job is to deliver returns, including for those who depend on income for their retirement. Rather than trying to make chief executives poorer they should worry about making their clients richer. It is one thing to fight soft incentive targets or the sort of goalpost shifting that made it easier for General Electric chief executive Larry Culp to earn a $47m bonus. But investors are bothering too much about pay at highperforming companies. They are also increasingly complaining about the ""quantum"", a word designed to confer scientific precision on a squidgy sentiment: ""It feels high!"" On this basis, one of the worst offenders is Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who in 2018 was given an options plan worth up to $56bn. Earning it requires a 12-fold increase in the carmaker's market value over 10 years and increasing profits and revenues by more than 15 times. The fact that Musk is on course to hit these targets with the market value having risen from $59bn to $565bn is either testament to his skill or evidence of a bubble. But if it endures to 2028, sensible investors will not begrudge him his full payout. One of those to endorse the scheme is Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based investment manager, whose own outperformance in recent years has been helped by its bold bet on Tesla. It takes a more liberal approach than many other UK investors, whose resistance to pay awards is generally greater than in the US, even though both pay and returns are much lower. Since he joined AstraZeneca in 2012, Pascal Soriot has re-energised the pharma company, fought off a takeover bid and presided over a 170 per cent rise in its share price. Whether he is paid £50,000 or £50m is of vanishingly little importance compared with the value he has created for shareholders. The FTSE 100 has managed an anaemic 21 per cent rise in the same period. Yet investors, including Aviva and Standard Life Aberdeen, protested against his pay last week. Chief executives tend to care about their pay. That is why banker Andrea Orcel was in court this week, arguing he deserves up to €112m compensation for a withdrawn job offer from Santander. Soriot thinks he is worth as much as US pharma bosses and resents being paid less. Perhaps that is a character flaw. But should he leave the company it will be poorer without him. Smith & Nephew lost a chief executive in 2019 who wanted to be paid on par with his US peers. The UK medical devices company's shares fell 9 per cent on the day Namal Nawana's departure was announced a £1.4bn plunge that comfortably outstrips any pay demand he might have made. They are still 17 per cent lower.    Of course there is excessive CEO pay. But it often lies outside the eyecatching numbers or plans. It is those who deliver mediocre performance year in year out with a high-six or lowseven figure package that is just low enough to keep the pitchforks at bay. In other words, people very much like many fund managers themselves. tom.braithwaite@ft.com Whether Pascal Soriot is paid £50,000 or £50m is of vanishingly little importance compared with the value he has created"
bf8c32d73f73826911c2,2021-05-20,Asbestos payouts are a harbinger of costs of climate inaction,"Letters Jamie Smyth's article on Australia's coal mining sector describes how a company, which had wanted to build a railway line for a coal mine, was unable to do so because of environmental concerns. This meant no one would insure them or their directors for public liability (""Australia coal mining sector warns of 'dire' risk from ESG insurance barrier"", Report, May 15). This is the tip of an iceberg. It is no wonder they were uninsurable. It is perfectly plain that green campaigners will increasingly be taking companies to court if they turn a blind eye to the damage their operations are doing. Few doubt that companies have some responsibility to address the climate challenge. Taken together with those of governments and individuals, these responsibilities must deliver a sustainable planet. But what is the company's responsibility? We don't have a clear definition. Yet if the climate crisis is not addressed, companies will be called to account for their failure. This has happened before. In the 1960s, asbestos companies were aware of the hazards of their products. At the time, it was not illegal to mine or process asbestos without proper protection. By the 1980s, the mood had changed. The asbestos companies were taken to court and sued out of existence. They nearly brought down the insurance industry with them. Insurers today would be crazy to cover such an open-ended risk for a company that, in the future, might similarly be deemed not to have fulfilled its responsibilities in addressing climate change. Defining the responsibility of companies is not just essential for a sustainable planet. It is also essential as part of the quasi-legal architecture that allows commerce to flourish and gives companies a licence to trade. Some, such as the Climate Principles for Enterprises group, have made an attempt to define enterprise obligations. But the issue has yet to get the prominence it deserves and there is no global consensus on what companies need to do. That needs urgently to be addressed. By the time we feel the effects of an out-of-control climate, and our great energy, power and transportation companies are taken to court for breaching their duties, it will be too late.

c29876508243b9d0a66f,2021-05-17,How satellite monitoring became a surprise ESG opportunity,"F or a while, Yuya Nakamura tells me, his company was firing microsatellites into orbit on spec. These 100kg starlets and their cutting-edge optical technology would undoubtedly be game-changing for someone, the start-up founder assured his financial backers, but only time would reveal who. With a third round of funding worth $24m secure, he has an unexpected answer: wily investor relations departments grappling creatively with the implications of environmental, social and governance standards scoring. The route here is noteworthy. As AxelSpace, Nakamura's Tokyo- and thermosphere-based start-up, became better established and financed, its launch trajectory was steepened by government and private-sector tailwinds. With civilian space industries advancing rapidly in the US and elsewhere, Japan unveiled a grandiose catch-up space policy with an emphasis on surveillance and reconnaissance under its previous prime minister Shinzo Abe. Major investment banks, including Morgan Stanley, began highlighting AxelSpace on rosters of next-generation disrupters and innovators to watch. Large corporations began jostling to invest. So far, so stellar. AxelSpace's constellation of small but powerful satellites (currently fivestrong, but planned to be twice that by 2023) offers prospective customers the chance to monitor anywhere on Earth at a level of detail that can pick out individual objects about the size of a car. Where it has focused its energies, though, has been in developing software that can analyse subtle changes in vast tracts of vegetation over a 24-hour period. Nakamura and his team imagined that this kind of data, when sold at a competitive price, would be of potentially huge value to a range of clients. Agricultural businesses have long sought to refine crop monitoring and harvest-time estimates. Insurers could make more accurate calculations of potential crop failure liabilities, and commodity traders could use similar data to gain a market edge. Increasingly, says AxelSpace, rural banks in developing countries are interested in using yield-prediction data to inform lending decisions to farmers. But the real stampede of interest, says Nakamura, has been from dozens of companies that have spotted an opportunity to answer increasingly numerous and insistent questions on ESG issues. Many see it as a way to grab points as portfolios are weighted to reflect the scores. If investors are asking about the environmental impact of a pipeline, a mine, a power-plant or a factory, how better to quell those concerns than with images of healthy vegetation captured and processed by a private microsatellite? Companies that say they have planted trees can provide live evidence of foliage. The speed with which these companies all, crucially, non- Japanese have seized on this chance is striking. It shows not only how far they will go to present a particular image to investors as the prevailing mood shifts, but also the clear perception by managements in US and European markets that they cannot now afford to do otherwise. But when I describe the satellite/sustainability phenomenon to Emi Onozuka, chief operating officer of the recently established Japan Catalyst activism fund, it only underscores her disappointment with the situation in Japan.    Some companies may get what is at stake and divert serious management bandwidth into treating their ESG scoring as a matter of potential value creation, she says, but the overwhelming majority do not. Onozuka is an important rarity: a Japanese fund manager who, after decades achieving seniority at a mainstream institutional investment firm, decided to become a shareholder activist out of sheer frustration with the pace of change in corporate Japan. ""Real activism"" is what is needed now, she says. Full-throttle ESG discourse, with an emphasis in Japan's case on the governance side, demands big changes of mindset that only activism seems able to propel. Onozuka is clear. She says for all its known flaws, and its appearance to some as a fad, the language of ESG investment represents powerful leverage in the effort to force changes of mindset on Japanese companies before the opportunity passes forever. It would be no bad thing if they felt pushed to contemplate the use of satellite images to keep investors happy. ""This is a chance for Japanese companies to change, but it has to happen now. We do not have time to wait or allow that style of thinking where you mull it over, come back, do it partly and eventually complete it in 10 years. We cannot be doing this in 2030,"" she says. leo.lewis@ft.com Companies have spotted an opportunity to answer increasingly insistent questions on sustainability"
27d9faaf1da56b8a5f74,2021-05-17,The sinister PR push that links cyber criminals to CEOs,"The misspelt scam email, the clumsy phishing attack, the gaudy pop-up virus threat. All these I can resist. Cyber criminals have developed an altogether more sinister weapon, though: the polite press release. DarkSide issued a statement after it was blamed for shutting down a vital US fuel pipeline with ransomware. It read for the most part like a standard piece of public relations guff. It combined concision, a non-apology apology for the inconvenience caused, and a purpose statement that would have made Milton Friedman proud: ""Our goal is to make money, and not creating [sic] problems for society."" DarkSide is the most prominent group in the fast-professionalising industry dubbed ransomware-as-aservice. From its unambiguous brand name to its ""customer"" support line, it is using tools of corporate capitalism to facilitate attacks on corporate capitalism itself. In a world of black-hat and white-hat hackers, say hello to the bowler-hat hackers. Tempted? Max Heinemeyer, director of threat-hunting at Darktrace, the cyber security company, told me there was a ""war for talent"" under way in forums on the dark web, where résumés and references are solicited. DarkSide is also wise to the ESG trend. ""We value our reputation,"" it says. The group has recently added funerals and crematoria to universities, schools, and municipalities as places it claims it will never attack. According to Databreaches.net, a cyber security website, it even makes occasional charitable donations. Criminal or not, any group of more than two people needs to be managed. The larger it is, the more structure it requires. After Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011, documents seized from his compound in Pakistan revealed al-Qaeda to be a complex matrix, with a rule book that insisted, among other strictures, that ""departmental expertise must be respected ... and should not be overstepped"". Similarly, a cyber security sleuth once told me it was possible to identify state-sponsored hackers because, like good public servants, they stopped attacking while they took their contractual one-hour lunch break. When Emotet, a notorious ""botnet"" of hijacked computers used to launch coordinated attacks, went offline in the summer, some speculated its masterminds were tending to their wellbeing by taking a holiday. As for DarkSide's ethical code, mafia bosses have long governed on the basis of internal principles that are often more carefully respected than a bank or consultancy's core values. DarkSide and its competitors have good business reasons for mimicking their targets, too, to present themselves as peers or partners of their victims. The mock legalese that they use also makes it easier for hapless systems administrators to explain a hack to their chief executives. ""If you're a company and you're hacked, do you pay the ransom demand that comes in a weird scam letter that you can hardly decipher, or DarkSide?"" Heinemeyer points out. He estimates eight out of 10 attacks are successful in encrypting corporate data, and between 20 and 50 per cent of companies pay a ransom to free their information.    That is a reminder that the most vulnerable brick in corporate cyber defences is usually human rather than technological. It should also make everyone more wary of legitimate pitches that bear the too-smooth veneer of PR and purpose. Whatever image DarkSide wants to project, the reality is likely to be less glamorous. When a co-ordinated operation took down the Emotet network earlier this year, Ukrainian police posted video from their raid on a dowdy apartment. If this was Emotet HQ, it was hardly the Googleplex. Even so, that a critical pipeline could be crippled by private hackers is worrying. Scaled up to become an Amazon of cyber crime, using the efficiencies of big business and the talents of amoral associates headhunted from the dark web, such groups could pose a bigger threat. Unless, that is, the faultlines that often destroy fast-growing companies also undermine the black-hat hackers. Such networks can collapse under their own weight. The documents in bin Laden's bunker showed that by 2011, al-Qaeda had grown into a rules-encumbered bureaucracy, with myriad committees and subcommittees, internal arguments about brand and mission, and divisive office politics. More likely is that DarkSide's reputational push backfires. The more notorious the hackers become, the more likely they are to feature among the FBI's Most Wanted. Big Tech faces a similar dilemma as it tries to dodge the regulatory radar, with one obvious difference. As Heinemeyer says, explaining why he avoided the dark side when he was a teenage hacker, ""prison is a big deterrent"". andrew.hill@ft.com ' In a world of black-hat and white-hat hackers, say hello to the bowler-hat hackers '"
9d5f4112955239d1055d,2021-05-17,Hot topic Carbon takes star role on earnings calls as investors turn a deeper shade of green,"Top executives are saying the word ""carbon"" on corporate earnings calls at a rapidly rising rate in the latest sign of the increased importance investors place on environmental credentials. Mentions of carbon and associated keywords have tripled over the past three years to around 1,600 per quarter, according to a UBS analysis of earnings call transcripts. Searches for the word in a financial context on Google have also reached an all-time high, according to the Swiss bank. The increased emphasis on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide comes during a period of swift growth in investments based on factors such as the environment, governance and social impacts. Global sustainable fund assets climbed 18 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the final three months of 2020 to almost $2tn, led by strong inflows into Europe, Morningstar data show. ""Carbon emissions are high on the political agenda across many countries and investors are also increasingly thinking about this issue,"" UBS said. UBS analysts found that investing in a portfolio of companies across sectors and regions with lower emissions intensity the amount of CO2 emitted per dollar of revenue led to improved returns over the past decade against the broader market. The low carbon intensity strategy generated returns of 11.6 per cent a year over the period, exceeding the MSCI World index of global developed market equities by 1 percentage point. The gains were driven in part because firms with strong emissions performance also tended to be more efficient in other ways, generating higher returns and profitability. But the momentum behind green investing itself also appears to be a big driver as accelerating flows of cash into low-carbon companies and funds have driven up valuations. The bank said the momentum effect could drive outperformance ""at times when public interest in carbon emissions is likely to increase"", such as during the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year. Critics have argued that ESG outperformance has been propelled by momentum alone rather than any underlying value. If this is the case, ""the outperformance of low carbon may come to an end when interest in sustainability stabilises"", the UBS analysts said. ""But we do not expect that to happen in the near future.""

29a5c64b17e1f9750304,2021-05-15,Australia coal mining sector warns of 'dire' risk from ESG insurance barrier,"Commodities A contractor on a controversial Australian coal mine said it had failed to obtain insurance for the project due to environmental concerns, underscoring how financing for the fuel in the country has dried up. BMD Group, which is working on Adani Enterprises' Carmichael mine, said in an appeal at a parliamentary inquiry that it may have to ask the government for insurance. BMD's claim was one of more than a dozen submissions from companies warning that the halt on financing for the sector due to environmental, social and governance concerns risked destroying Australia's A$20bn (US$15.5bn) a year thermal coal export industry. BMD is building a section of a rail line at Carmichael, a 10m-tonne per year thermal coal project that has inspired global climate protests. BMD was declined by at least 33 underwriters for public liability insurance on the project because of the affiliation with Adani, according to the former's submission. BMD said either clients would need to absorb risks on behalf of their contractors if they could not obtain insurance or the government would have to provide insurance from public funds. ""Failure to take any action can only result in very few contractors being willing or able to undertake these critical infrastructure works,"" the group. BMD told the inquiry it has been subjected to activism from climate change protesters and anti-coal groups, including threats of violence against the group's owners and families. Australia's inquiry into the financial sector's treatment of export industries came after Keith Pitt, minister for resources, accused banks and pension funds of ""corporate activism"". ""This is precisely why I have asked for this inquiry and I look forward to the outcome,"" Pitt said of BMD's submission. ""How is it possible that the company constructing a railway track that could carry cattle, grain, people or any number of other items is being denied insurance because it carries coal. The product being moved doesn't affect the construction risk whatsoever."" Adani told the inquiry that banks and insurers were set to completely withdraw from coal by 2030, which would have a ""dramatic and adverse impact"" on the industry. Adani told the Financial Times that it had the necessary insurance in place across the entire Carmichael project.

116bda38bceb0aeb98a3,2021-05-15,"Emerging markets: risk, reward and the effects of Covid","Retail investors have vastly increased their exposure to the sector during lockdowns, hoping to anticipate a post-pandemic recovery, writes Jonathan Wheatley s now a good time for retail investors to buy emerging market stocks and bonds? I At the height of a pandemic, as growth stutters across the developing world and governments struggle to replicate the success of vaccine rollouts in advanced economies, it may seem odd even to pose such a question. Yet, it seems to be one that many investors are not only asking, but answering with a ""yes"". The number and value of emerging market-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) and similar products tradeable funds that typically appeal to retail investors have risen remarkably during the coronavirus crisis. There were 1,670 such products worldwide at the end of March, according to industry watcher ETFGI, up from 1,447 at the start of last year, while their market capitalisation rose by more than a quarter to $742bn (£528bn) over the same period. What's more, retail investors seem attuned to strengths and weaknesses among the emerging markets (EMs), with their eyes drawn less by problem-hit Brazil than by the huge energies of China. Interactive Investor, the UK's second-biggest fund supermarket, says China-focused investment trusts and mutual funds feature strikingly among its biggest sellers so far this year two out of four EM products in the top 40 investment trusts and one in three in the top 40 mutual funds when there were none in the same period of 2020. Deborah Fuhr, US-based founder of ETFGI, says many retail investors, with time on their hands during the pandemic, have taken an interest in global investment themes, such as Chinese technology stocks, especially when they are discussed on television. ""A lot of men I don't think they had a lot of hobbies they did at home,"" she says. ""Being locked in the house, many of them decided to put some money aside to play with."" Retail investors are riding on the back of a broader institutional surge into EMs. Figures from data group Morningstar shows that investors pumped more than $100bn into EM stocks and bonds in the nine months to the end of March, more than making up for the roughly $44bn they withdrew in the first half of last year as the pandemic took hold. ""What we can say with a high degree of confidence is that investors at large have begun to dedicate more to emerging markets,"" says Ben Johnson, Morningstar's director of global ETF research. Flows into the asset class broadly over the past 12 months amount to ""probably the most significant sign of interest we have seen in about a decade"". But this all comes against a tricky background for emerging economies. On the one hand, their share of global output has surged this century, doubling in dollar terms. On the other, it is still just 40 per cent of the total, even though they are home to more than 80 per cent of the world's population. And the pandemic is having an uneven impact, wreaking havoc in Brazil, for example, but largely sparing China.    Also, gross domestic product growth does not translate easily into stock market returns. With markets often skewed by government intervention and opaque rules, well-connected local business people tend to do better than regular financial investors. Emerging markets provide about three-quarters of global economic growth, but their equities have lagged behind the S&P 500 index of US stocks for much of the past decade. Developed world retail investors have barely dipped their toes into emerging markets. Investment trusts, mutual funds and ETFs the kind of vehicles favoured by small investors make up a tiny share of the total investment in EM stocks and bonds, and that share has barely budged for a decade. So there is plenty of scope for increasing EM exposure without upsetting the balance of the average portfolio. With many analysts thinking that the outperformance of US stocks in recent years is looking decidedly frothy, could views now change? Might this be the moment to look again at emerging markets in general? A new story with old roots There is a long history of investors hunting for profit in undeveloped economies whether in Latin American railways, South African gold or Indonesian rubber. The modern story of EMs starts in the 1980s, when fund managers in the UK and other rich countries sought to take advantage of the high returns on offer from fast-growing countries in Latin America, south-east Asia and other parts of the developing world. The countries classified as emerging markets have changed almost beyond recognition since then. Today's MSCI EM index of equities in 27 countries the most widelyfollowed benchmark includes some, such as South Korea, Taiwan and the Czech Republic, that have made such progress that few outside the index-driven investment community would regard them as any less developed than industrialised economies. But while the landscape has changed, the proposition remains the same: emerging markets, as they catch up with countries in the developed world, will grow more quickly, offering greater rates of return on investments. The downside is that such growth, and the returns, can be highly erratic. The profits were often stellar during the commodities supercycle of the 1990s and 2000s, when Chines demand fuelled growth in raw materials exporters such as Brazil. Since then, some formerly fast-growing economies not least Brazil have suffered stagnation and recession, prompting some to ask whether EM investing still makes sense at all. Still, some states, especially the south-east Asian countries, have learnt to avoid past mistakes. They have generally tamed inflation, managed domestic and external deficits well, and coped better with volatility by reducing reliance on foreign debt and building cash buffers of foreign reserves. The rise of China The biggest single transformation has been the seemingly relentless rise of China. Its demand for commodities of all varieties, agricultural as well as mineral was such that many emerging economies rode through the global financial crisis of 2008-09 relatively unscathed. Since then, its growth has remained the single most powerful driver in the developing world. Nevertheless, emerging economies are not immune to shocks. The ""taper tantrum"" of 2013 reminded investors that EMs are at the mercy of bigger forces. The US Federal Reserve caused waves when it suggested it might soon begin tapering a massive economy-boosting bond-buying programme indicating that the rockbottom yields might soon begin to rise. Foreign investors withdrew from EMs en masse, irrespective of how successfully or otherwise policymakers had reformed their economies. Since then, the highs and lows of EM assets have often been driven by the US dollar. When the dollar is weak and US growth is slow, investors are willing to take more risk. At such times, EMs offer attractive returns. But when the US dollar strengthens as it did unexpectedly in 2018, catching many EM investors offguard money can flood out. At times like these, even Chinese assets can take a beating. These forces are at work today. With the US economy rebounding from the pandemic more quickly than many expected, the biggest issue on the minds of professional investors is whether or rather, when US inflation and interest rates will rise, spurred by the Biden administration's huge fiscal stimulus. If US yields suddenly become tempting again, emerging markets could once more see money sucked away to America. ""The US fiscal spend completely dominates the debate,"" said Bhanu Baweja, chief strategist at UBS investment bank and an emerging markets specialist.    But while familiar dangers lurk so too do the incentives for EM investing. As Jan Dehn, a longtime flagbearer for EM investing at fund manager Ashmore, points out in 2019 emerging economies accounted for 74 per cent of global economic growth and were forecast to contribute 84 per cent by 2023. The pandemic may have slowed that advance, yet few doubt that, in the long term, EMs are where the growth is. Yet, gaining a share of the upside from that growth is challenging as the risks are unevenly spread. Contagion between emerging markets is much less than it was a decade ago. When a crisis blows up in a more volatile market such as Argentina or Turkey, it no longer sweeps across the rest of the asset class. Each emerging market has its own set of challenges and opportunities, and the correlations between them are now lower. What became of the Brics? Of the Brics held up as future stars by economist Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs in 2001 Brazil, Russia, India, China and, a later addition, South Africa three have lost their shine. India and China, however, have continued to deliver. Beijing's huge stimulus during the global financial crisis saved not only its own economy but also those of many other developing countries and, perhaps, even the industrialised world. Beijing's focus has changed in recent years, from investment to consumption as the driver of its economy, with a concern for financial stability tempering its enthusiasm for credit-fuelled growth. Investors in EM assets should keep a close watch on policy. India has also seen strong growth over the past decade. This year, it was able to announce a big increase in public spending to counter the pandemic without scaring investors a testament to their faith in its growth story, although the ferocious second wave of Covid-19 sweeping the country over the past month has raised questions. By contrast, Brazil, Russia and South Africa have all seen growth stutter, stagnate or even go into reverse during the past decade. Nicolaj Sebrell, senior equity analyst at Rowan Dartington, part of the St James's Place wealth management business, says the gains from a country-by-country strategy are potentially great. He argues that investors can outperform by avoiding basket cases like Venezuela and Argentina and sticking to states with credible policies, reasonable growth prospects and inexpensively priced markets. He says: ""EM is an asset class because we've defined it that way. But it's also just a selection of countries. If you can treat them all as individual markets, that has some real advantages."" Sony Kapoor, managing director of the Nordic Institute for Finance, Technology and Sustainability, says this is an approach not open to many. Only those unconstrained by liquidity and time sovereign wealth funds and the very rich he says, can benefit from country-specific knowledge and sit through the risk-on, risk-off cycles of US monetary policy. ""For the rest of us, sadly, index-hugging is the default option."" Nevertheless, the outlook remains uncertain, with the pandemic increasing the differences between states. It is hard to see how those economies that were foundering before the coronavirus crisis will be any better placed afterwards. But those countries that have managed the pandemic well notably in east Asia could be rewarded with new investment. Funds are the typical EM entry point Most investors taking first steps into emerging markets use actively managed funds such as investment trusts and mutual funds, which typically aim to beat the market for a fee. Or they use passively-managed exchange traded funds (ETFs), which aim to replicate a benchmark index, charge no, or very low, fees, and can be bought and sold like shares. Dzmitry Lipski, head of funds research at Interactive Investor, says that while emerging markets will benefit from the post-pandemic recovery, and the long-term investment case remains intact, ""for most emerging markets, vaccination against Covid-19 remains a story for this year and, probably, next"". It is hard to gauge how significant retail investment is in emerging markets. Morningstar data suggest that while total investments in EM stocks and bonds are worth two and a half times what they were a decade ago, the amount represented by investment funds is still small.    Mutual funds, open-ended trusts and ETFs made up less than 2.5 per cent of global emerging markets equity in March, data show, unchanged from 10 years ago. In fixed income funds, the share was slightly less than 1 per cent. Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, says retail investors are likely to be influenced by home bias more than institutional investors. ""Retail investors globally are under allocated not just to emerging markets but to any markets outside their home country."" But a preference for home does not necessarily rule out EM exposure. Unilever in the UK and Yum Brands in the US are old favourites among investors looking for a local play on EMs without investing overseas. Deborah Fuhr of ETF data service ETFGI says one trend driving more retail investment in emerging markets is the rise of so-called robo-advisers. At Wealthfront, for example, a highrisk portfolio would include a 16 per cent allocation to emerging markets more than the median allocation of 6 to 7 per cent among global equity funds. Lipski suggests four funds for retail investors to consider, starting with JPMorganEmerging Markets Trust, which is conservatively run, with a bias towards domestic consumption. Then there is Stewart Investors Global Emerging Markets Sustainability Fund, which took account of environmental, social and governance issues long before ESG became a buzzword. Lipski also likes M&G Emerging Markets Bond Fund's mix of government and corporate bonds, and Utilico Emerging Markets Trust, a play on infrastructure opportunities. Michael Arno, a portfolio manager at investment company Brandywine, says that despite the changing nature of emerging markets, the old rules apply. ""It's all about diversification and making sure you are not taking an exuberant amount of risk,"" he says. ""But emerging markets are the growing part of the global economy and there are definitely periods when one should be invested."""
31bb94921e1a71d23501,2021-05-15,Aberdeen founder shops for boutique fund manager,"Financials Gilbert's new venture AssetCo buys Saracen in quest for growth Martin Gilbert, the acquisitive founder of Aberdeen Asset Management, has returned to the dealmaking fray and scooped up Edinburgh-based boutique Saracen Fund Managers through his new venture. AssetCo, the Aim-listed company of which Gilbert became chair in April, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Saracen for £2.75m. The deal marks the first step in its strategy to use its platform to make acquisitions in the asset and wealth management industries. ""We need to acquire a regulated entity,"" said Gilbert, who established Aberdeen four decades ago and helped orchestrate the £11bn all-share merger between Standard Life Investments and Aberdeen Asset Management in 2017. ""Saracen was typical of a good asset manager that had struggled to grow. That's where we think we can help."" Saracen was founded in the late 1990s and has five full-time employees and three funds, which together manage about £120m in assets. In the financial year ended March 31, the group recorded turnover of £985,364 and a post-tax loss of £15,146. David McCann, an analyst at Numis Securities, described Saracen as ""a nice little business but obviously it's very small"". He added: ""It doesn't move the needle for AssetCo but it's about what they do next. The expectation is that this is used as a building block for something much bigger."" Dealmaking is sweeping across the fragmented asset management industry. Gilbert, who stepped down from the board of Standard Life Aberdeen in December 2019 and is also chair of fintech Revolut, said AssetCo was ""pretty ambitious"". He added: ""There are lots of opportunities for consolidation at all levels because of headwinds like the move to passive, fee compression, ESG and the move from public to private markets. We grew Aberdeen largely by organic growth and acquisitions. That is our current strategy but at the boutique end of the market."" AssetCo also owns a small stake in UK investment group River and Mercantile. Gilbert and Peter McKellar, who is also a director of AssetCo, will join the board of Saracen once the deal is completed. Standard Life Aberdeen's share price has tumbled about a third since the merger. The group last month cut its dividend by a third after full-year pretax profit fell almost 17 per cent and investors yanked money from its funds. It was also widely mocked after saying it would change its name to Abrdn. Gilbert said: ""The merger was obviously going to be difficult but the business is not alone in having to look at overheads because of the headwinds the industry is facing. It has the strongest balance sheet in the sector."" He added he was ""supportive"" of the rebrand. ""That's me being diplomatic.""

737ab3709eae834dac06,2021-05-14,Musk wakes up to bitcoin's fossil fuel issues,"FINANCE Gillian Tett E lon Musk, founder of Tesla, recently christened himself ""technoking"", or king of tech. A better moniker might be ""Wizard of Oz"". The entrepreneur possesses a startling ability to tug the strings of the crypto world. In February, bitcoin prices leapt when Musk revealed that the company had bought $1.5bn worth of the cryptocurrency. So did the price of dogecoin following similar Delphic tweets. But last weekend dogecoin tumbled when Musk admitted on an American comedy show that the asset might be a ""hustle"". And now bitcoin has tumbled too after yet another tweet, this time one revealing that Tesla will no longer accept bitcoin for purchases of electric cars. ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal,"" Musk said. Activists and journalists have, of course, been highlighting this issue for months. Two striking statistics encapsulate the problem. First, it seems that two-thirds of bitcoin to date has been mined created through computing algorithms in China, using data centres reliant on electricity generated by coal. Indeed, bitcoin's link with the black stuff is so tight that Alex Lipton, a crypto expert, notes that bitcoin prices move whenever accidents occur in Chinese coal mines. Second, the $2tn crypto market has expanded so fast that it is gobbling up vast quantities of energy. Mining bitcoin, which accounts for half of all crypto, currently uses the same amount of energy annually as the Netherlands did in 2019. Scientists warn this threatens the Paris climate goals. Bitcoin enthusiasts such as the entrepreneur Anthony Scaramucci point out that statistics need context and that traditional finance is energyintensive too. So are other types of technology. As a paper co-authored by a former researcher from Google's artificial intelligence ethics unit notes, some of the AI processes behind Google search are ""estimated to require as much energy as a trans-American flight"". Even with such caveats, the fact is bitcoin's carbon footprint is embarrassing, not just for Tesla but for millennial crypto investors who care about green issues. And that in turn highlights three big lessons for all investors. First, nobody can afford to ignore environmental, social and governance concerns today, even in stocks labelled as ESG. Tesla is featured in many ESG funds because investors have focused on the electric car point and ignored other issues. However, digital transparency is now enabling activists to monitor companies' activities more effectively than ever before. This means that investors need lateral vision when they value companies, since ESG risks are rarely static or binary and often involve tradeoffs that constantly shift.    Second and leading from this investors need to watch the debate around tech's carbon footprint as an example of this shifting landscape. A scramble is under way to tackle bitcoin's carbon issues. The Rocky Mountain Institute, a clean energy non-profit, recently joined forces with UN officials and fintech leaders to explore solutions. One might entail changes to the computing processes around crypto to cut energy consumption; last week a ""green"" cryptocurrency which uses less processing power called Chia was launched. Another option is to use green electricity sources, for instance by switching Chinese coal for Icelandic hydroelectric power. Enthusiasts such as Scaramucci think this could solve the issue if there is a registry that enables investors to track the provenance of bitcoins. Which idea might work is unclear. But the debate probably explains why Musk dispatched his tweet. And why the veteran investor Stanley Druckenmiller said this week that it is unclear which cryptocurrency will eventually dominate (assuming you think, as Druckenmiller does and I do, that crypto is here to stay). Few people predicted 15 years ago that Facebook, not MySpace, would come to dominate social media. The third point is about regulation. The reason Musk can act like the Wizard of Oz of crypto, with impunity, is that the sector is opaque and largely unregulated. Financial policymakers are now threatening a crackdown. But as a report from the Bank for International Settlements notes, ""the vast majority of jurisdictions in the world"" have not implemented controls to stop money laundering, let alone market manipulation. Plus there is ""significant variability in the definition of the regulatory perimeter across jurisdictions"". In plain English, oversight is a mess. Libertarians like it this way. So might Musk. But if crypto is going to become more mainstream with whatever token it badly needs more accountability and transparency. Maybe that will be impossible to achieve given crypto's anti-establishment origins. But the fight over green standards might, just possibly, start this process by providing a cause for young crypto-enthusiasts to rally around. If so, that could turn out to be the most consequential impact of Musk's tweet and a reason for investors and regulators to conduct some belated scrutiny of the Chinese mines, both of the coal and computing variety. gillian.tett@ft.com Tesla's founder can act like the Wizard of Oz of crypto with impunity because the sector is opaque"
f5ae0cebcff0f72737ff,2021-05-14,Beware risks of the spin behind climate change,"Cyrus Taraporevala Markets Insight T he year is 2040. For decades, investors and regulators alike have been encouraging companies across the globe to decarbonise by mid-century. As a result, MSCI announces for the first time in its 54-year history that every company in its World Index more than 1,500 publicly traded companies has achieved net zero. And yet, few are celebrating. Despite the largest companies in the world all having committed to carbon neutrality, a UN report shows that carbon emissions globally have actually gone up. How could that be? Well, in the rush to be ""green"" some companies adopted strategies that reduced their emissions or helped them become more efficient, but others simply relied on offsets that delayed the inevitable. Worse, some opted to avoid public scrutiny altogether. Indeed, while many in the media have seized on ""greenwashing"" companies embracing sustainable practices for public relations purposes a far greater danger is ""brown-spinning"": selling off the highest-emitting components of businesses to private equity and hedge fund actors at a discount. This can reduce disclosure, shield polluters and marginalise the voice of the investor. Certainly, the push to net zero is both urgent and necessary. With US President Joe Biden rejoining the Paris Accord, companies across the globe see the writing on the wall, and are setting ambitious net-zero targets. Investors are stepping up as well. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative that aims to help big investors strip out damaging carbon emissions now has 87 signatories, representing nearly 40 per cent of all global assets under management Meanwhile, there is urgency for businesses to respond: today, the failure to address climate concerns comes with increased reputational risks. But pushing them to set aggressive emissions targets is only half the job when it comes to transitioning to a net-zero future. How will companies get there? Many will evolve their business models from dirtier sources of energy to incorporate renewables such as wind and solar, as we are seeing in many European oil and gas companies. Some will develop new technology to manufacture products such as ""green steel"", reducing the largest sources of industrial emissions. Still others may use this moment to reinvent their businesses radically. These would be good outcomes for our environment and for companies a win-win. But for others the decisions will be harder, more costly and more complex. For instance, while carbon offsets may be a financially viable alternative, they do not reduce overall emissions and should probably only be used if there is no choice. Likewise, businesses that have a harder time reducing their emissions outright may invest in carbon capture or take more intermediate steps such as buying carbon credits. Some companies may simply take the easy path of brown-spinning and sell off their highest emitting assets to the top private bidder who may be less concerned about climate change.    To be sure, some private equity firms have embraced ESG and sustainability and are doing great work in this space. Unfortunately, the public has limited insight into the emission impacts of privately held companies. That's why the role investors play in holding companies accountable on the journey to net zero is so important. When investors are at the table, we can use our voice to urge disclosure of metrics and strategy and, if no action is forthcoming, our vote. As investors, we must be crystal clear on our expectations for companies, following through on commitments by vetting transition plans, sharing best practices and scrutinising any offsets or spin-offs of portfolio companies. Our goal is to ensure that portfolio companies' transition plans to a carbon-neutral world represent good value for investors over the long term. We should also push for better, universal disclosure. Public and private investors alike would benefit from more relevant and standardised ESG data that helps us understand companies' capital allocations and the quality of their transition plans. While much is uncertain, what is not in doubt is that with investors at the table, there will be fewer opportunities to profit off pollution. Public disclosure will increase, not evaporate. And with a focus on the how, there will be far greater accountability to deliver the climate progress we all want to see. Cyrus Taraporevala is chief executive of State Street Global Advisors Some companies may simply sell off their highest emitting assets to the top private bidder"
c59357104495d7575b6e,2021-05-14,Musk rules out bitcoin payments for Tesla cars,"Crypto RICHARD WATERS SAN FRANCISCO Elon Musk reversed his backing of bitcoin as he announced that Tesla was suspending plans to accept payment for its cars in the cryptocurrency. He put the change of heart down to environmental concerns about the mechanism used to validate bitcoin transactions, pointing to a wider rethink of the digital currency that could throw into question its growing appeal among other companies. Bitcoin was down 9 per cent to $49,769 yesterday following the announcement late on Wednesday. Musk has faced sharp rebukes over Tesla's support for bitcoin, including from ESG investors who prioritise environmental, social and governance issues. The Tesla chief executive's enthusiasm for the energy-hungry currency ran counter to the climate change concerns that he has always said led to his involvement in electric cars. Bitcoin jumped 15 per cent in a single day in February after Tesla revealed it had put $1.5bn of its corporate cash into the digital currency and planned to one day accept it in payment for its cars. The news was widely seen as an important validation in the corporate world and sparked a debate among corporate treasurers about using bitcoin. In a brief statement released on Twitter, Musk said: ""We are concerned about [the] rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel."" Bitcoin uses a ""proof of work"" mechanism, relying on so-called miners who employ large-scale clusters of computers to crunch puzzles using a consensus algorithm. Musk's statement concluded by saying Tesla was ""looking at other cryptocurrencies that use <1% of bitcoin's energy/transaction"" a comment that could provide a shot in the arm to digital currencies that use other less powerhungry ways to validate transactions. Ether, the second-most valuable cryptocurrency, has said it was moving to an alternative method known as ""proof of stake"", which does not depend on the same energy-hungry method. Musk also appeared to swear Tesla off active trading in bitcoin to boost its future profits. Investors were surprised last month to discover that it had sold part of its cryptocurrency holdings within weeks for a $101m profit. Along with sales of environmental credits, the currency trading profit more than made up for a loss in Tesla's core carmaking business in the first quarter of the year.    ""We will not be selling any bitcoin,"" the Tesla boss said in his statement, though he did not shed any further light on how long the carmaker would hold the cryptocurrency. 'We are concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions'"
c905f5dd378dcb227e90,2021-05-14,Digital thinking spreads across region as roles broaden out,"Lawyers in countries such as Japan are narrowing the gap with the most 'future-ready' law firms, writes Reena SenGupta When the Financial Times published its first Innovative Lawyers report covering Asia-Pacific in 2014, it revealed some startling disparities between different countries in how innovative their law firms and in-house lawyers were. Australian law firms, for example, were innovating more than some of the most advanced firms in the UK. By contrast, managing partners at Japanese law firms were not convinced that being innovative was right for a traditional profession. Today, many Japanese firms perform well in the FT's rankings of innovative law firms and are increasingly embracing a multidisciplinary, automated future. For example, Nishimura & Asahi last year set up a digital transformation group that provides both legal and non-legal support for clients on a range of new technologies, data and regulations. to help them undertake digital transformation. This kind of offering is unusual at Japanese firms and more common in the UK, the US and Europe, where firms have long augmented their legal expertise with complementary disciplines. In addition, the Nishimura digital transformation group works across legal practice areas and industry sectors. Kazuhiro Takei, the Nishimura partner who set up the initiative, says the most significant feature of the group is that it is multidisciplinary and cross-sectional in its approach. The idea of moving away from legal practice areas as the structure for organising a law firm's way of working is truly radical thinking from any lawyer, anywhere. Historically, law firms have organised themselves around their own legal specialisms unlike other businesses, which mirror the structure of their clients. This trend of lawyers broadening out their roles is highlighted in two sections in particular in this report: developing the market (pages 12-14) and individual practitioners (pages 22-23). As the need to work around the Covid-19 pandemic accelerates the digital transformation of many companies, lawyers have had to race to keep up with the pace of business innovation. A prime example of this came from King & Wood Mallesons, which created the legal standardisation required for the first digital bank guarantee in Australia. When lockdown safety measures precluded the use of paper guarantees, the firm worked with Lygon, a consortium that includes three leading Australian banks, to create a digital version using blockchain technology. The work which would have been ""spooky"" for a traditional lawyer, according to Scott Farrell, the KWM partner involved has provided a new business model for the issuance of guarantees. The time taken to issue a guarantee has also been reduced from one month to a single day. The project involved corporate, banking, regulatory and competition lawyers working alongside bankers, data scientists and digital engineers. ""The work probably touched on, even in the firm, five or six traditional [practice] areas,"" Farrell says. ""But the skill wasn't just corralling people, it was corralling ideas."" Law and tech had to work in harmony with each other.    In the innovative practitioners' section, it is apparent that several of the individuals featured could simply be referred to as ""digital lawyers"". From pioneering non-legal advice to making the law easier to access and understand via legal design, these practitioners are able to straddle converging industries, such as finance and technology. Grace Chong at Simmons & Simmons in Singapore, and Scott Thiel at DLA Piper in Hong Kong, are both versatile in the fintech sector, for example. Another featured practitioner, Sara Rayment, trained as a lawyer at KWM before setting up her own legal design law firm, Inkling Legal Design, in Australia to help revolutionise the content of legal documentation and make it more consumer-friendly. Much of the innovative work by lawyers makes the law easier to access and businesses more sustainable even if these are not the prime objectives. One feature of Nishimura's digital transformation group is its focus on sustainable governance, helping clients think digitally and consider their environment, social and governance (ESG) obligations. Thiel believes his tokenisation platform for asset-backed securities in a test by DLA Piper, the first asset used was a piece of fine art has the potential to increase access to finance because it lowers the entry level for investors. Nearly all the firms in the FT's annual ranking of the most innovative law firms in the region (see table) have noticeably embraced digital transformation and sustainability. Those at the top are all becoming ""future-ready"" law firms. Among the international firms those that do not have their headquarters in Asia-Pacific Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is an example of a leading organisation using its credibility and influence to have an impact on both local and global social and trade questions. In the past year it has created an app for asylum seekers in Hong Kong that helps them know their rights. The firm has also been trying to ease trade frictions between China and the west by helping to facilitate Chinese investment deals in Europe. However, the standout innovative law firm in the Asia-Pacific region is King & Wood Mallesons. Its commitment to the digital economy can be seen throughout its business, from training its lawyers to improve their digital literacy to helping Chinese clients better understand the implications of using data in an international market place. More importantly, KWM is a firm that continues to show resilience. As Farrell puts it: ""The world is changing so fast. Everything I know has to be changed again.""

0635570d8728514db0ba,2021-05-14,Lawyers help Tesla unlock rooftop solar power potential,"Renewable energy The carmaker's battery tech will help stabilise the electricity grid in South Australia, says Henry Sanderson Batteries based on Tesla's expertise in electric cars are now helping to optimise the growing number of rooftopsolar installations in South Australia. But it is a project that has required asmuch legal, as technological, expertise. By linking up thousands of solar powered homes and new batteries, the initiative will ease the stress on the electricity grid caused by peaks and dips in solar power. In effect, the electric car maker is creating a 'virtual power plant' in a community of 3,000 social housing units inadelaide, which will aggregate energy from their individual solar panels and its batteries. It is part of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk's mission to translate the technology it has developedfor cars into storage for renewable energy. For residents, the A$61m ($47m) project will provide more affordable clean electricity at noupfront cost. It is being financed by the Australian government-owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the South Australian government,and Tesla itself. However, the plan has required a new legal structure to ensure that residents are protected. ""The magic is in how it's aggregated,"" says Jeremy King, a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons,of the solar-plus-battery approach. ""On an individual basis, economically it doesn't stack up, but once you aggregate it and have centralised control over thousands of systems, economically it starts to make sense,"" explains King, who arranged the legal work for the project. One of the challenges to emerge from the rise in the number of rooftop solar installations in South Australia has been volatility in local power prices because energy from solar panels surges when the sun is at its strongest. Average daytime power prices in South Australia fellbelow zero for the first time in the first quarter of this year, according to the Australian EnergyMarket Operator, the regulator. They hit minusA$12/MWh in the first three months, it says. But, by aggregating solar energy in multipleTesla Powerwall batteries rechargeable units designed for use in homes enough energy canbe provided to the grid when it needs it. Energygenerated in the day can be available in peakperiods of demand during the early evening. Lithium-ion batteries enable sudden bursts of power to be switched on as needed. This virtual power plant system uses Tesla's cloudbased software to charge or discharge energyfrom batteries, trading it on Australia's NationalElectricity Market. The capacity of a virtualpower plant ""can sometimes match or even exceed a traditional power station"", says theAustralian Renewable Energy Agency. In 2017, Tesla built a giant lithium-ion battery at the Hornsdale Power Reserve, with an energy storage capacity of 129 MWh, which is helping to integrate solar and wind energy into Australia's electricity grid. Tesla will now install a 5 kW rooftop solar system and a 13.5 kWh Powerwall battery at premises owned by Housing SA, the owner of the social housing. Along with previously installed systems this will deliver 20 MW of generation capacity and 54 MWh of energy storage. King notes that the virtual power plant willgenerate revenues    to pay back the money from Clean Energy Financing Corporation for installing and building the project, by selling energy to the National Electricity Market. It will also gainrevenue by providing a back-up source of generation for the grid operator to call on. Lawyers were needed, though, to create legal agreements that protected the housing authority's sometimes vulnerable and disadvantagedtenants while also giving the lenders securityover the assets, in cases of non-payment. Unlike a typical project finance arrangement, the loan had to be structured so the lenders would have no capability to enforce the debt byselling assets in the case of any default, King explains. That was to avoid any chance however remote of the main lender going to the tenants' homes and ripping out solar panels to resell them, he says. ""You can't, politically, enter into council housing and rip panels off the roof. That would fail the 'pub test' if you speak to the average person on the street, that would look terrible."" Residents in the housing units were also offered electricity at the same price whether they consumed energy from the grid or the newsystem. Participation was voluntary, King says. The project is a test case for Tesla's ability to bundle its solar panels and batteries. In April, the US group said it would only sell its solar panels along with Powerwall battery units, so as to better integrate the two devices. Musk said the Powerwalls could operate as a ""giant distributed utility,"" to help power grids that may struggle to meet growing demand for electricity due to the proliferation of electric cars. Without batteries there would be blackouts and power cuts. ""[The utilities] won't be able to react fast enough,"" Musk warned in Tesla's first-quarter earnings call recently. ""We're seeing more extreme weather events ... so it is very important to have solar and batteries at the local level, at the house [level]."" King says the model created in Adelaide could be scaled up with the addition of more houses nearby, or undertaken elsewhere in Australia. All that is required is for the houses to have smart meters installed, he says. The Australian government says there could be a network of 50,000 solar and Tesla Powerwall home battery systems across South Australia. ""It's something that is better on a macro basis: the bigger it is, the more punch,"" says King. Sustainability From pro bono projects to new financing models for renewable energy projects, these lawyers are facilitating sustainability. WINNER Pinsent Masons The law firm advised Tesla, the US electric vehicle and battery company, on the financing structure, contracting and regulatory issues surrounding Australia's largest virtual power plant. It is the first in the country to be centrally owned and operated by a company. The plant in South Australia comprises solar panels distributed across 3,000 social housing units. The lawyers designed agreements that protect the needs of tenants while giving financial backers security over the assets. The documentation provides a model for similar future projects. Ashurst The law firm launched a new practice group in Australia to advise clients on board-level governance, green finance, renewables and carbon capture. The firm also represented digital finance provider Brighte on a 100 per cent green asset-backed term securitisation, enabling the business to provide energy, batteries and home improvements to Australian households. Ashurst also launched a digital product, ESG Ready, to help clients comply with new regulation. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Norton Rose Fulbright Acting for a group of port operators in Hong Kong, the two law firms achieved antitrust clearance for a collaboration between the operators in the form of the Hong Kong Seaport Alliance. The collaboration improves the efficiency and environmental impact of Kwai Tsing Port by enabling vessels to be serviced by any of the alliance's berths. Herbert Smith Freehills The firm developed a due diligence service that focuses on environmental, social and governance (ESG) challenges for client investments or acquisitions. A cross-practice, multidisciplinary team developed a triaging tool and processes for specific risk areas, including anti-bribery, human rights and climate change. The process involves reviewing businesses for their compliance to current regulations, plus internal risk assessments and scenario planning. Hogan Lovells The law firm devised flexible contracts for Netherlands-based environmental nonprofit organisation The Ocean Cleanup. The new contracts enable the NGO to create distribution and operation partnerships with    countries in Asia to build its river-cleaning machines the group intercepts plastic pollution in rivers to prevent it reaching the sea. The Ocean Cleanup has since signed a deal with Malaysian manufacturer Konecranes, helping it to achieve its aim of cleaning 1,000 rivers worldwide over the next five years.

Research methodology Asia Pacific 2021 FT Innovative Lawyers Asia-Pacific 2021 is a ranking, report and awards scheme for lawyers based in the region. The Financial Times and its research partner, RSG Consulting, have devised a unique methodology to rank lawyers on innovation. Law firms and in-house legal teams were invited to make submissions. The categories focus on different areas of legal practice, business and operational management, and social justice and inclusion. The categories and examples featured in the report are drawn from submissions and nominations from law firms and inhouse legal teams. Each submission is researched and scored out of 10 for originality, leadership and impact for a maximum score of 30 (scores for each individual entry are not shown in the report). In addition, law firms were asked to complete a questionnaire on use of data and technology. Each of the 10 questions was scored out of five and benchmarked against peers in that region. Top-ranked submissions in each category are featured as mini case studies and shortlisted for the FT Innovative Lawyers Asia-Pacific 2021 awards. Some 250 submissions and nominations were received from 65 different law firms and 30 in-house legal teams. RSG researchers assessed the submissions and interviewed the firms' clients, senior lawyers, executives, and experts between February and April 2021. Most innovative law firms in Asia Pacific 2021 The ranking showing the ""most innovative law firm in Asia Pacific"" and ""most innovative law firm in Asia Pacific (international)"" is based on each firm's aggregated scores for its top three submissions plus the score for the firm's use of data and technology.

a70644ced46ec20fe55d,2021-05-14,Why digital demands deep thinkers,"People and skills Digitisation Young lawyers who are tech literate and business savvy are in high demand. By Sarah Murray F rom climate change and labour rights to cross-border deals amid geopolitical tensions, lawyers face increasingly complex challenges. And, as digitisation transforms every sphere of practice, firms want their lawyers to become far more collaborative and multidisciplinary. Changing client demands are partly behind this, including the pressure from in-house lawyers to cut costs that is prompting a shift from billable hours. This, along with the digitisation of many mundane legal tasks, calls for lawyers to be more strategic in their advice. ""For a results-driven client, you have to think like the client and understand enough about their business sector to scope out what you need to do for them,"" says Philip Anderson, professor of entrepreneurship at French business school Insead's Singapore campus and programme director of the SALInsead Law Firm Leadership Programme. ""That, more than anything else, is driving the need for new expertise."" Meanwhile, as technology transforms the way lawyers do their jobs particularly when working from spare rooms and kitchen tables law firms and in-house lawyers have recognised the need to make digitisation available to all. At Chevron Australia, for example, Schellie-Jayne Price the energy group's senior legal counsel, negotiations and legal worked with the IT director to create a ""tech café"" modelled on Apple's Genius Bar. During the pandemic, the café went virtual, to keep experts availableto employees. ""They were able to provide realtime remote assistance,"" says Price. While digital literacy is essential, BerkeleyCox, chief executive partner, Australia, at King & Wood Mallesons, cites another type of literacy that his firm looks for when buildinglegal teams: ""Asian literacy"". By this, he meansan understanding of the challenges specific tothe Asia-Pacific region. Among these are the need to tackle emerging priorities such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) approaches to business and the law, which require ""a broaderunderstanding of what's at play in the world"". As ESG is a factor in practice areas from procurement to energy and labour rights, italso demands organisational changes. Where once law firm leaders might have simplycreated a new, separate practice, saysAnderson, ""that won't work because ESG cuts across all your engagements"". Nor, he says, does building ESG capabilities mean hiring environmental law experts.""What's wanted for a young lawyer is theability to connect the dots, putting legal advicein the broader framework of what the client is trying to accomplish,"" he says. ""One does notlearn how to do that in law school."" "" There is also a need for other skills that havnot traditionally been part of legal jobdescriptions, says Price. ""Empathy, curiosityand an entrepreneurial spirit are pretty key,""she says. ""You need someone with a growthmindset who is open to new ideas.""    Encouraging this openness was among thereasons why, in May 2020 as the pandemictook hold, KWM went ahead with its ""transformation programme"". Its purpose wasto prepare staff for everything from thedigitisation of legal processes and changingclient demands to competition from newmarket entrants. In addition to putting younglawyers through digital boot camps, the firmcreated incentives to encourage KWM lawyers to work in different ways. For example, ""themultiplier"" allows them to record internally1.5 hours for every hour spent using digitaltechniques on a client matter. While the client is billed for one hour, the multiplier"" encourages the lawyers to try out new tech. Promoting the use of technology was whyIndian law firm Anand and Anand chose Zoho Creator as a development platform. It requires only limited coding knowledge, enabling non-IT experts to become ""citizen developers"".Among the resulting innovations was a virtualversion of the firm's annual carnival, hosted on Zoho Creator. Run during Diwali, the festival oflights, the virtual event let family members to participate for the first time, ""engaging people during these tough times"", says Rajiv Maheshwari, Anand and Anand chief executive. The platform also facilitates design thinking, an approach that focuses on the user experience and relies on prototyping and testing to develop solutions to problems. ""This is a sea change, as the user is also a process designer who can also implement the system on their own,"" says Maheshwari. As technology turns lawyers into anything from design thinkers to app developers, the pressure is on to attract, retain and develop lawyers with more rounded skills, says Price. However, firms and in-house teams may benefit from the idea that the new ways of working appeal to ambitious young lawyers. ""If I was a young lawyer graduating, I would be very excited,"" she says. ""Because I'll get to do more of what I want to do as a lawyer."" People and skills Firms are using inventive ways to train their lawyers and other staff to use tech, data, and a creative approach to problem-solving. WINNER King & Wood Mallesons Lawyers at the firm are encouraged to dedicate 30 billable hours a year to improving their digital literacy as part of a programme of digital transformation; engagement is tracked using dashboards. The firm has created incentives for lawyers to make better use of technology, with a multiplier applied to their billable time. For every four billable hours, the lawyer can record six hours for internal purposes if they use tech as part of their job. The scheme has led to a very substantial increase in the adoption of technology. Allens The firm created ""innovation squads"" in each of its practice groups to encourage employees to engage with innovation. Made up of lawyers and business professionals in the firm, these squads identify problem areas and develop solutions to help clients. Anand and Anand Business staff at the law firm have been trained to be ""citizen developers"". The initiative used design thinking based on user experience, and testing via quick prototypes and agile working principles along with the low-code suite of software developed by Zoho, an Indian company, to create new apps. Lander & Rogers The firm designed a programme to train undergraduate law students at Monash University in Melbourne. Participants learnt about design-thinking processes and agile methodologies. They worked on clients' reallife challenges and used legal technology to devise solutions.

4a82587d5d9fe95ffe56,2021-05-13,Rich remain sceptical about changing the world with their money,"S witzerland used to be a place where the rich came with their money to escape the world's problems, not to confront them. These days, the private banks that dot the pristine streets of Zurich and Geneva are no exception when it comes to the wave of enthusiasm that has broken over the asset management world for better environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. Yet for all the small forests that have been felled to produce the glossy brochures (containing, mostly, pictures of forests) littering the lobbies of Switzerland's grand finance houses, many of the very wealthy remain stubbornly sceptical when it comes to changing the world with their money. ""Private clients are behind the curve,"" says a senior executive at one of Switzerland's biggest private banks. While institutional investors are obsessed with ESG, he says, most wealthy individuals and family offices still tend to see it as philanthropy rather than investing. Putting 10 or 20 per cent of a portfolio into ESG strategies is one thing, he says, but all of it, quite another. Another banker in Zurich is less circumspect: the entrepreneurs and oligarchs of the developing world that have been some of Swiss banking's most coveted quarry in recent years have often made their money from a global carbonemitting boom. The businesses they own and the markets they understand can often be the ones with the very worst environmental records. He recalls the awkwardness of the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019: at the same time as preaching from the gospel of sustainability, private bankers were falling over themselves to pitch an investment in one of the biggest fossil fuel producers. Still, it is out of such politesse others might call it moral plasticity that Swiss banks were built. Indeed, even if ESG investing is still a relatively small part of what the rich do with their money in Switzerland, it is growing extremely fast. At UBS, the single biggest banker to the wealthy, sustainable investments made up 18.9 per cent of its advised assets at the end of last year. That is up from 13.5 per cent in 2019. While institutional investors are with ESG, individuals see it as ESG is in many ways a bank's marketing dream because it is so loosely defined. Even done badly, it can be sold easily. In the enthusiasm for ""impact"" investing Swiss bankers are pushing, where experts offer to tailor portfolios to concerned clients based on their own specific environmental or social worries a sort of bespoke ethical package there are no clear-cut moral choices.    Credit Suisse's list this week of the top ESG investments, sector by sector, for example, names Goldman Sachs as the best stock to buy for ""social"" impact. Many might disagree. Likewise, electric cars sound good, but what about the environmental impact of massively boosted demand for rare earths to make all those batteries? The complexity of constructing an actually holistic ESG portfolio, rather than one geared largely to vanity, deters all but the most engaged clients, admits one senior ESG guru. But there is a clear generational divide on this, and perhaps that is what Switzerland's bankers, with an eye on the children of their current clients, are really gearing their ESG efforts towards. ""There is a big shift happening right now,"" says Nicole Curti, a Switzerlandbased wealth adviser at Stanhope Capital. Impact investing dominates the concerns of her younger clients, she says. They will drive change among the super-rich, Curti believes, particularly as their voices come to play a bigger role in wealthy families' future planning. In a stark illustration of that possibility, last week Michel Jabre, 34, son of Philippe Jabre, 61, one of Switzerland's most prominent hedge fund managers, and an arbitrageur long associated with the hardest-charging side of finance, launched a fund at his father's firm to focus on ""conscious capitalism"". Michel said he had been ""deeply put off by all the greed [he] had seen in the financial system"". A cynic might regard such matters as an old story, of a younger generation struggling to define itself against successful parents. Curti disagrees. ""It's about an overall societal change taking place,"" she says. Regardless, for Swiss bankers the focus is unlikely to relent. Not least because, beset with a sixth year of negative interest rates, risk-management disasters and a looming global deal on tax, ethical investing is one of the few positive things left to talk about. sam.jones@ft.com While institutional investors are obsessed with ESG, most wealthy individuals still tend to see it as philanthropy"
27b1f83c3d34e953ac33,2021-05-11,ESG studies must show scientific rigour to avoid feeding biases,"Letters The new Scientific Beta study (""ESG outperformance narrative 'is flawed', new research shows"", ETF Hub, May 3) has caused a splash by showing that common claims of an environmental, social and governance alpha are much more fragile than portrayed. But their findings will not be surprising to anyone who has analysed the ESG data carefully. Scientific Beta is right that claims of outperformance must control for other factors, and be based on long time horizons. Indeed, this is the role of academic peer review no top journal should publish a study that failed to do this. In contrast, the papers that Scientific Beta correctly criticises are either unpublished, or in practitioner outlets. However, given confirmation bias the temptation to believe even flimsy evidence if it supports your preferred viewpoint many people latched on to these studies, despite their basic errors. Views on ESG swing from one extreme to the other. One month, there are claims that ESG clearly improves performance; the next, all these studies are said to be flawed. The more sweeping the conclusion, the more headlines it grabs, but reality is somewhere in the middle. Certain ESG factors do pay off, over long time horizons and even after controlling for other variables. But others particularly those that are not material to a company's business model do not. To avoid such black-and-white thinking, we should pay attention to studies based on their scientific rigour, rather than whether they support our personal beliefs on ESG.

Millennials are still concerned, like many other investors, with their return on investment and how much money they have added to their portfolios. As active investors, they have roamed into areas like GameStop and Bitcoin while using Reddit and social media to get their information. On that tune, they follow investor Peter Lynch, but instead of going to the malls, they get their information online and using various websites. Their technological acumen is a sharp contrast to the old line world of investors well at least most of them. When it comes to their money in the market, which they have earned through working and their online side hustles, being an active investor in different sectors is where they learn about the market. It is their embracing of technology and closeness to it that gives them a leg up. The market is for making money. If they want to do social good, they will find a non-profit organisation and volunteer their time on the weekends. Before going into socially oriented or environmental ESG funds, it is their time to learn and understand their style of investing. This article might appeal to some, but not all.

a6c2f5170fe20eace556,2021-05-11,Wind knocked out of rally at Orsted and Vestas,"Utilities. Renewables Unexpected cable damage and missed profits have made for a difficult quarter A difficult quarter for the biggest wind companies has taken the shine off several renewables darlings amid an accelerating sell-off in clean energy shares. Many have suffered stock declines over the past two weeks after bad news in first-quarter earnings, including unexpected cable damage at Orsted, the renewable energy generator, missed profits at Vestas, the turbine maker, and lowered earnings guidance at Siemens Gamesa, also a turbine maker. Wind and solar companies were among the best stock market performers last year, defying pandemic turmoil in the broader energy market thanks in part to government climate pledges and big inflows into new clean energy exchange traded funds. Observers say the sector is normalising after steep gains last year. ""When you fly really high, you can fall further down, and they were really on fire last year,"" said Casper Blom, analyst at ABG Sundal Collier. ""There is probably a recalibration under way."" The decline comes amid a broader fall in clean energy stocks over the past three months, which analysts put down to fears over profitability, rising interest rates and increased competition. ""For these companies that are expected to see high growth for many years, the interest rate really matters because it means a higher cost of capital,"" said Blom. Inflows into clean energy ETFs have slowed in recent months, the funds' market capitalisations falling 26 per cent from their February peak, according to analysis of 10 large clean energy ETFs by Berenberg. The 10 funds reported inflows of $13.7bn over the past 12 months, primarily late last year and early this year, but outflows have increased during the past two months. ""ETF flows were one of the drivers of strong share prices last year, and those have perhaps slowed,"" said Henry Tarr, analyst at Berenberg. ""The flows into clean energy are more neutral at the moment."" Concerns about profitability and competition have also risen for several of the biggest clean energy stocks, which typically trade at much higher multiples than the rest of the energy sector. The share price of Orsted, the world's biggest offshore wind farm developer, has fallen 35 per cent from its January peak, including a drop this month after the company reported unexpected costs from underwater cable damage and lower than expected quarterly profits. Marianne Wiinholt, chief financial officer, said some cables were being scraped by rocks laid at the base of turbine foundations, a problem that could affect as many as 10 wind farms.    ""For many of the cables, we will be able to stabilise them,"" said Wiinholt, who explained that a layer of rock added above the cable could resolve the matter. ""Guidance for the year is unchanged,"" she said. The cost of the cable repairs is expected to be about DKr3bn ($490m), with most of the outlays occurring in 2022 and 2023. Orsted is also facing growing competition from energy companies that are piling into offshore wind and driving up prices for development rights. As more companies move into renewable energy, investors are starting to have more choice in how to invest in the clean energy trend, according to John Musk, RBC analyst. ""In 2020, the [clean energy] thematic was very new and there was a rush toward clear ESG winners,"" he said. ""Whereas now there is a more balanced view, with more competition and more options for investors on this theme."" Siemens Gamesa recently cut its earnings outlook because of project delays and referrals. Vestas, its rival turbine maker, has held its full-year guidance but firstthe quarter revenue and earnings were worse than expected. Henrik Andersen, Vestas chief executive, said supply chain problems contributed to the miss. ""In Q1 we had 90-plus days where everything went against us,"" he said, pointing to transportation challenges including the blockage of the Suez Canal. ""In a pandemic year ... everything becomes more fragile."" The Danish company has also been hit by the brutal wave of coronavirus sweeping through India, where it has a significant presence along with roughly 4,000 employees. Andersen declined to comment on the company's share price, which has fallen 23 per cent since its January peak. ""If that has some adjustment or correction at the beginning of this year well the best is yet to come,"" he said. ""It doesn't change one single inch of how we run Vestas."" $13.7bn Inflows into 10 big clean energy ETFs over past 12 months 35% Decline in Orsted shares from their January peak 'In Q1 we had 90-plus days where everything went against us' Henrik Andersen, Vestas chief"
4443c2946c54e4430049,2021-05-11,Reputational fears propel surge of green investment,"ESG Companies are scrambling to bolster Brazil's environmental credentials, says Michael Stott Reputational fears propel surge of green investment W hen Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro committed to ending illegal deforestation in the Amazon by 2030, the sceptics had a field day. Some noted that his pledge, made at a US-sponsored climate summit last month, was an old one: first made by his predecessor Dilma Rousseff in 2015 (and derided even then for its lack of ambition). Others joked that Bolsonaro would achieve the target by completing the destruction of the entire rainforest by 2029. Critics pointed out that, despite promising to double resources for the enforcement of environmental laws, Bolsonaro approved a budget for 2021 which slashed enforcement funding by more than a third. ""We debated internally whether Bolsonaro's letter to Biden [in which he stated the commitment before the summit announcement] even merited a response, since there is such deep scepticism that he intends to do anything differently to achieve the 2030 zero illegal deforestation target,"" says one leading institutional investor in Brazil. This scepticism is understandable: deforestation of the Amazon has surged to its highest level in more than a decade under Bolsonaro; protections for indigenous peoples have been eroded; and illegal loggers and ranchers are among the president's staunchest supporters. But lost in the brouhaha was another government promise: that Brazil would achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, 10 years earlier than previously planned. That pledge had been suggested in an open letter to Bolsonaro from the CEOs of around 30 leading Brazilian compa- nies and it is an indication of the growing power of the business lobby to influence government environmental policy. Sylvia Coutinho, country head of UBS Brazil, the local arm of the Swiss banking group, describes 2020 as a ""turning point"" for Brazilian corporates. ""It is very clear to all the CEOs that I interact with, across a broad spectrum of industries, that ESG [environmental, social and governance investing] matters and has become a mainstream agenda item that they need to address,"" she says. ""There's a real commercial and reputational concern among Brazilian business"" about the environment, adds Annelise Vendramini, co-ordinator of the sustainable finance programme at São Paulo's FGV-EAESP business school. Small investors in Brazil, whose numbers have surged as lower interest rates made the stock market more attractive, have also started to demand that their money is channelled towards companies that score well on ESG criteria. Carlos Takahashi, president of asset manager BlackRock Brazil, says more than 30 per cent of the inflows from Brazilian investors in the first quarter of this year were destined for the company's ESG exchange traded funds. ""This is a good thermometer and ... confirms that we have investors in Brazil also interested in ESG products"", he says.    XP, Brazil's largest equities brokerage, recently surveyed 30,000 of its clients and more than 70 per cent were interested in allocating money to ESGfriendly companies, according to Marta Continued on page 5 Continued from page 1 Pinheiro, XP's executive director for ESG and business development. ""I believe that ESG is a big business opportunity for Brazil,"" she says. Although, internationally, the ""E"" aspect is the one Brazil is usually scrutinised under, in the domestic market many investors have been more interested in the ""S"". Like others around the world, Brazilian companies have work to do in improving relations with local communities, and a history of racism against the black population makes diversity initiatives highly relevant. Despite accounting for over half of the country's 210m population, black or mixed-race Brazilians occupy less than 5 per cent of executive positions and 5 per cent of seats on company boards and this representation has barely improved in the past decade. However, ESG measurement in Brazil is still in its infancy and does not yet employ the detailed criteria being adopted in Europe the de facto global standard-setter. ""This is a challenge also in Brazil, for sure, to have a more clear identification on what is really a sustainable investment,"" Takahashi says. Fabio Alperowitch, who co-founded Fama Investimentos, one of Brazil's first ESG funds, in 1993, is also worried about this lack of rigour in measuring ESG performance, and the lack of investor knowledge. ""A lot of investors in Brazil don't understand ESG,"" he says. ""Some of them think it's about excluding arms companies."" Amid the confusion, Alperowitch says, some companies are trumpeting ""green"" investments which are not quite what they may seem. As one example, he cites Via, a Brazilian retailer, which last month issued a ""sustainability-linked bond"" to raise up to R$1bn ($180m). The company's announcement says that the proceeds will be used to lengthen debt maturities and fund regular operations. ""In return, they are making a commitment to raise the proportion of renewable electricity they consume,"" Alperowitch says. ""But electricity is not the major environmental issue facing a retailer. Packaging would be more relevant."" Via says it has set a target linked to the bond of boosting its use of renewable energy from 30 per cent to 90 per cent by 2025. Separately, it plans to set a target for reducing carbon emissions by the end of this year and will cut overall energy consumption and increase recycling initiatives. Some Brazilian companies already meet international criteria for environmental performance and sustainability. Natura, the cosmetics group which also owns Body Shop and Avon, secured group certification as the world's biggest B-Corp, or environmentally and socially sustainable firm, last year. Retailer Magazine Luiza has blazed a trail on social criteria with its diversity programmes for black employees. Car hire firm Localiza won a best ESG award from research company Institutional Investor. And pulp and paper company Suzano last year became the first emerging market corporate borrower to issue debt that included a financial penalty for missing a carbon emissions target. Even so, the difficulty for investors wanting to screen companies on ESG criteria is that the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) offered by B3, Brazil's sole exchange operator, includes some of these paragons but also takes in statecontrolled oil company Petrobras and meat companies Marfrig and BRF. B3 also runs a ""Carbon Efficient"" Index (ICO2) which includes Petrobras and the scandal-plagued meat company JBS. As the world's largest meatpacker, JBS has been dubbed an ""Amazon destroyer"" by environmentalists for failing to ensure its supply chain is free from cattle raised on deforested land. Ana Buchaim, B3's director of sustainability, declines to comment on the inclusion of specific companies but says the ISE ""is not an index of exclusion"" and was designed to nudge Brazilian companies to improve their performance, rather than to shame them. ""We have a robust methodology,"" she says. ""But the index is not a certification, it is a benchmark. Big public companies want to show their commitment to ESG, they see it as a source of competitive advantage."" Fama's Alperowitch says: ""It's one thing to make ESG promises but quite another to deliver on them. I would love to see proper regulation.""    Still, with international investors stepping up their scrutiny of Brazil's ESG record, and the threats of investor or consumer boycotts increasing, pressure on the country's leading companies is growing. Their CEOs are hoping that Bolsonaro's apparent conversion to the cause of protecting the Amazon proves to be lasting. ""Each country is a brand,"" says FGV's Vendramini. ""You don't just export your product, you also export the brand of your country. And if the government is acting against something in your brand, that's a concern.""

While I do not intend to be an academic, will the qualification increase my chances of securing a position in the banking industry? Anonymous Jonathan's answer The banking and finance industry covers a wide range of activities and roles, from buyside fund managers, analysts and researchers to sellside sales, trading and market making. It will help if you can narrow down the sort of job you seek as only some of these roles would benefit from advanced skills in specific areas such as quantitative analysis, modelling, and coding. Studying for a PhD can enable you to demonstrate some important traits of successful bankers, including a keen interest in and wider understanding of banking and global markets, high analytic intelligence, confidence with figures, stamina, energy, and maintaining good working relationships when under pressure. Many of these skills can be learnt on the job, but a PhD could help you gain them while also learning some specific technical skills, and networking widely to understand the industry better. While you say that you do not intend to be an academic, a PhD would keep that option open if you were to change your mind, maybe after a spell in industry. In their study of a sample of PhD graduates, Billy Bryan and Kay Guccione identified four domains of doctoral value: career, skills, social and personal values. While your question focuses on just one of these, the instrumental use of a PhD to gain a career advantage, the PhD graduates in the study cited these three other factors. They noted that within the career area, a doctorate gave them professional credibility and enhanced reward, as well as the issue behind your question: the ability to land the job. The PhD graduates recognised the transferable and project-based skills they had learnt, many of which can be applied in the banking industry. Socially, they felt the PhD had brought them esteem, status, and access to rewarding networks of colleagues around the world. At a personal level, the graduates felt a strong sense of achievement and enhanced personal identity from having a PhD. You will have to decide which of these you already have, which you would like, and of those you don't have and would like, whether you can get them via a PhD or on the job. If you are concerned only with the career-enhancing properties of a higher degree, then a masters will probably provide sufficient skills to give you an edge in gaining an analyst or research role in banking, and would be quicker. Readers' advice I know investment bankers who followed the same path. They obtained the doctorate ... and were promoted quickly to VP level. During your PhD studies you will build vital skills. Mo I know nothing about finance but something about getting a PhD. It took three and a half years of everything I had: personally, emotionally, intellectually. It was exhausting and exhilarating. Do not go down that path unless you cannot bear the thought of anything else. Particularly do not go down it just because, oh, it might be useful. xerxes If you have the time and conceptual ability it is deeply rewarding for its own sake. StrategyProf Next problem I left my corporate job at the end of 2019 with plans to take a holiday and start afresh. But it has turned into a pandemic-induced existential career crisis. I have pursued various openings but cannot decide which route to take.

87b6fa3d6844950c5a19,2021-05-10,Disparities in ESG criteria no barrier to investor demand,"Index providers each use a 'secret sauce' to set sustainability standards, writes Attracta Mooney Behind the scenes in the investment industry, a battle is playing out: index providers are vying with each other to provide the benchmarks needed to meet demand for sustainable funds. In Europe, flows into exchange traded funds that focus on environmental, social and governance factors outstripped flows into all other types of ETFs in the first quarter of this year, Morningstar data showed. Globally, the assets under management in ESG funds have ballooned from $10bn in 2015 to $246bn as at the end of March, according to ETFGI, the data provider. Meanwhile, the number of ESG ETFs has jumped from 90 globally in 2015 to 578 today. With investor appetite for sustainable ETFs soaring, index providers have rushed to grow their range of indices, often buying up specialist data providers or investing in internal tools in anticipation of ESG benchmarks becoming more lucrative. Aaron Yoon, professor in accounting and information management at Kellogg School of Management, says index providers ""see value in ESG"". ""It is too big to ignore these days,"" he observes. ""These indices now understand it is going to be a big business and are putting a lot of money into how to best do it."" But, as demand for the indices rises, there are growing concerns about how they are compiled. Some critics have questioned why companies appear in certain benchmarks but at the same time are shunned by others ? as well as whether ESG indices really are a sustainable investment option at all. Many of the first ESG indices were specialist in nature, focusing on companies tackling water scarcity and developing clean energy. In recent years, however, there has been a shift towards more generic indices that purport to provide an offering similar to traditional benchmarks, such as the S&P 500. This change came as fund managers told index providers of the growing market of investors who desired mainstream investments but with a sustainability tilt. According to data from ETFGI, the MSCI USA Extended ESG Focus Index is now the largest benchmark in the sector globally. ETFs with some $15.5bn in assets track the index, although the total could be larger when all index funds are included. Other popular broad ESG indices include the MSCI Emerging Markets Extended ESG Focus Index, the FTSE US All Cap Choice Index and the S&P 500 ESG Total Return Net. Specialist indices also rank highly in terms of assets under management, according to ETFGI, including the S&P Global Clean Energy Index and the MAC Global Solar Energy Index. But many popular sustainable indices receive a low score for ESG, research from TrackInsight, the data provider, shows. While ETFs tracking the S&P Global Clean Energy Index received an A+ score from TrackIn- sight,    others, such as those replicating the MSCI USA Extended ESG Focus index, were given a C+ (D is the lowest score). There are also questions around whether appropriate companies appear in ESG indices. Last year, several fund managers attributed their holdings in Boohoo, the UK retailer that was engulfed in a scandal over workers' rights, to the company having been included in the benchmark indices they were tracking. Nizam Hamid, an independent index and ETF consultant, says there is ""no common model for defining how a company meets ESG criteria"", partly because different investors prioritise different aspects of sustainability. Instead, each index provider has a ""secret sauce"" when it comes to how they compile their indices and assign a score to a company. For example, Hamid says MSCI has 10 themes and 37 factors it considers when developing a score for a company, while FTSE Russell has 14 themes, and S&P has 23 criteria. ""That gives you a very wide variation for the same company by different providers,"" notes Hamid. ""A company could be highly rated for one, but not at another."" Remy Briand, head of ESG at MSCI, says its company ratings are sector specific. This means that, in energy and mining, for example, there is a greater focus on the environmental impact, while in retail there is emphasis on the supply chain, and in technology, on cyber security and privacy. MSCI also ranks companies relative to their peers. Boohoo therefore had a moderately high rating compared with other retailers because there were some in the sector that had ""bigger problems"" when it came to ESG, explains Briand. MSCI and S&P have different methodologies for how indices are constructed, as well. This means that it is possible to have two benchmarks that both notionally cover Europe, but with very different companies included. ""It is difficult for a lot of end investors to see their way through all the variations and that creates a challenge for index providers and fund providers,"" says Hamid. But despite the growing pains, Reid Steadman, managing director and global head of ESG indices for S&P Dow Jones Indices, says there is ""good momentum"" in demand for ESG indices. ""This is still a nascent area,"" he says. ""This is not a short-term trend. I have been in product management roles where I have seen themes come and go. But this is really one that is part of a mega trend."" 'A company could be highly rated for one index provider, but not at another'"

8147a1d9d4b5d6dbce65,2021-05-08,Danone's ex-boss claims power struggle lay behind his sacking,"Faber cites board rift Old guard role highlighted ESG labelled 'the excuse' Former Danone chief executive Emmanuel Faber said a boardroom power struggle led to his dismissal in March, and not a campaign by activist hedge funds or his advocacy of companies acting on environmental and social issues. In his first interview with the international press since his departure, the 57-year-old described months of infighting, including over his plan to reorganise along more geographical, rather than product, lines and to axe 2,000 jobs. With Danone's results worsening because of the pandemic, some board members opposed the strategy and wanted Faber out, people familiar with the matter earlier said. Faber said they used his activism on environmental, social and governance issues as a convenient weapon but it was not really about that at all. ""ESG was the excuse that people found to play this game,"" he said. ""The fact is that these activists had no plan, and without support from inside the board, they would just be nowhere. The activist investors were allowed to play for reasons that were related to a situation where the board was not functioning properly."" Although Faber did not mention him by name, he described a power struggle with Franck Riboud, the former Danone chief executive and chair who selected Faber as his successor in 2014. Although Riboud's title is ""honorary chair"" of the board, he has outsized influence as the son of the company's spiritual founder, Antoine Riboud. His father not only built Danone into a global force but laid out its distinctive culture in a 1972 speech that argued that business had a responsibility to further social progress beyond ""the factory gate or the office door"". Faber said: ""It's very clear that previous leaders had hopes to regain more clout. The reasons [he was ousted] have very little to do with actual performance."" Riboud could not be reached directly. Danone declined to comment. Tensions began late last year when Faber announced the restructuring plan, Local First, along with the unex- pected departure of longtime finance chief Cécile Cabanis, the latest in a series of high-level exits. The crisis broke into the open in January when activist Blue Bell took a small stake and began calling publicly for changes, including Faber's departure. It was joined later by US fund Artisan Partners. The board led by new chair Gilles    Schnepp, former head of industrial group Legrand, is searching for a new chief executive. But Schnepp has pledged to stick with Local First, so the incoming leader may have limited room to chart a new course. Danone must honour the obligations it made to secure legal status as an entreprise à mission, or purpose-driven company, one of the first companies in France to do so. Faber had championed the change to allow Danone to serve a wider set of stakeholders such as farmers, customers and employees, rather than just shareholders. The change was overwhelmingly backed by a vote of shareholders in June 2020. Faber declared that they had ""toppled the statue of Milton Friedman here today"". But while the activists criticised Faber for not delivering for shareholders, he does not see his ouster as a sign that Friedman's ideas have prevailed. Instead he believes that Danone will continue its work in areas from soil health to carbon emissions, and that more companies will incorporate purpose-driven values into their management. ""You will see that entreprise à mission will stay ... I'm absolutely convinced about it,"" he said, adding that the system could be a stabilising force for companies. Other chief executives should not fear backlash from activists if they decide to pursue purpose alongside profit, he said. ""You need just to make sure that the board is there with you."" 'These activists had no plan, and without support from inside, they would just be nowhere'"
f104716512225f6461e7,2021-05-08,Merryn Somerset Webb Investing,"Even non-ESG funds now have a greenish tinge L ast year was the year ESG investing (finding homes for your money while looking out for environmental, social and governance concerns) really took off. In 2020, $152bn of new money poured into ESG-labelled products and global assets in these products hit more than $1.6tn. The young are all over it. A new survey from Montfort Communications, a PR company, and Boring Money, a financial news website, makes the point. In a poll of retail investors, some 63 per cent of 18-34-year-olds say they would choose a new fund manager based on their approach to ESG. That number falls to 17 per cent for the 55-plus group. In the younger group, 78 per cent of respondents say ESG affects their investment choices. That falls to 67 per cent among the 35-54 age group and about a third of the 55-plus group. The 2021 ESG Investor Insights Report, from French banking group Natixis, reports that 68 per cent of savers surveyed say they want their investments to consider the impact on people and the planet, with the young more enthusiastic than the old. These numbers will tally with many you have seen before. Ask anyone if they'd like to be nice or seen to be nice and mostly they will say yes, with the young saying yes more often (either because they are more interested in ESG or because they're more interested in optics we can't know). The problem with ESG investing is that it is hard work you have to do actual research if you want to find a fund to suit your preferences. That might be one reason ESG action doesn't seem to match ESG survey answering. In a recent Aegon poll, 77 per cent of those surveyed said that they think climate change is an important risk to consider when investing. But only 15 per cent of the same people say they are following that thought up with active ESG investing. And the many people who say they want their investments to align with personal values? It isn't clear they're following their thoughts either: UK financial professionals say that only 42 per cent of their clients asked about ESG in 2020. Good news then: it might not be necessary for you to do anything at all. If your ESG feelings are of only average intensity it might already have been done for you. In 2019, 39 per cent of investing institutions said they did not implement specific ESG policies. In 2021, only 28 per cent said the same, says the Natixis report. So more than 70 per cent of institutions are now ESG a go go. The number saying they integrate it into their processes was up from 19 per cent to 48 per cent. Various impact/ active ownership/best in class strategies make up the rest (ESG is marketing buzzword heaven). You may say that these definitions appear to cover pretty much any activity (I'd agree); that, while regulators are working on the standardisations, the definitions of all these are in many cases so blurred as to be meaningless; and that everyone's criteria are completely different (one man's green dream is very often another's sin stock).    You might also say, if you were so inclined, that this divergence of measurement makes a nonsense of the idea (held by 53 per cent of institutional investors) that companies with better ESG records generally post better investment returns on their stock. Perhaps those returns are not a function of corporate performance but at least in part a function of the demand for shares generated in the scramble for ESG-friendly portfolios? Nonetheless, the mood music has changed. Everyone is ESG investing, partly, it would seem, because that's what the young say they want and they're the ones now financing the greatest industry bonanza of all time (auto-enrolled pensions). As Nick Bastin of Monfort says: ""These long-term potential revenue streams represent a massive opportunity that asset managers ignore at their peril."" However, it might also be that the shift is about more than what the kids want. Fund managers have to follow the regulations and regulation is getting to the point that pretty much mandates attention to ESG issues. Around the world, for example, ESG reporting is being made mandatory for asset managers and the idea that all managers have ESG responsibilities is now standard. Here's Sir Jon Thompson, chief executive of the UK's Financial Reporting Council, on our new stewardship code for asset managers: ""There is a clear and consistent expectation that environmental, social and governance issues, including climate impact, are included in stewardship and investment decision-making."" If you want to be a well-regarded brand in the asset management market place, you'll at least want to look like you are living up to those expectations. Talk to any of the bigname fund managers and they'll tell you about their ESG overlay and their stewardship department. That department will be operating throughout the business. The upshot is, whatever the labels say, whether you buy an ESG fund or a non-ESG fund from a big-brand fund manager, you will still be buying one with some kind of an ESG overlay. The difference, for what it's worth, will be in the portfolio. There are lots of niche do-good funds of course (related to renewable energy and the like), but in general, if you buy an ESG labelled fund, the odds are you'll get a quality growth fund probably with a bias to tech with a lot of blurb in the marketing about ESG. If you buy a non-labelled fund you'll get whatever else it says on the tin (income, growth, global, whatever) with a lot of blurb in the marketing about sustainability. So you could see the way in which survey respondents fail to follow through with action as a problem. Their fine words butter no parsnips. Or you could note that an ESG fund will mostly have much the same effect on the world in which we live as a well-run non-ESG fund. In this sense, everyone, apart from those who actively want a ""sin"" fund jammed full of companies regularly behaving badly, is already mostly getting what they say they want, whether they know it or not.

d4c4de1bcc09d0bf63d6,2021-05-06,Acciona wins admirers with plan to make sustainability add up,"W hen Michael O'Leary is ready to pay a premium for sustainable jet fuel to help save the planet, you know the business world has changed. The chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair last week pledged to power 12.5 per cent of its flights with green fuel currently two to four times more costly than standard fuel by 2030 in a bid to cut carbon emissions. It was a sharp U-turn on his previous position that Ryanair would shift from traditional fuel only if prices were equivalent. Not everyone captures attention like the outspoken O'Leary. But others are quietly doing even more in a sign of how mainstream climate issues have become for companies. Just days before the Ryanair boss's change of heart, the Spanish infrastructure and renewables company, Acciona, unveiled a new fiveyear sustainability plan. Acciona has long focused on the issue. In 2009, the board set up a ""sustainability committee"" and it has been net-zero carbon emitting since 2016. But buried in the details of its new plan, Acciona revealed it had moved sustainability from the marketing department, handing responsibility for environmental, social and governance targets to the finance director. It may not be an outright first. But the decision is so rare that those who advocate integration of financial and sustainability reporting struggle to think of another company that has done the same. Jessica Fries, executive chair of Accounting for Sustainability, a charity founded 17 years ago to make the issue a core discipline of finance departments, describes it as ""a really powerful signal"". Acciona was not alone in leaving sustainability with marketing, Fries says. But, as policymakers set aggressive environmental targets and regulators move to demand disclosure, ESG issues are being seen as material factors in the financial wellbeing of a business. CDP, a not-for-profit group that runs a sustainability disclosure system used by about 6,000 businesses worldwide, has estimated that the financial risk from climate change to the world's 500 biggest companies comes to just less than $1tn, based on survey answers. But climate-related opportunities outweighed that risk at $2.1tn. Giving ESG the finance that those who such integration to find another With such sums at stake, some investors are demanding as much rigour in measuring performance on ESG criteria as they do for returns on investment or profitability. They are also demanding oversight of sustainability should sit at board level rather than being farmed out to managers with little executive power. Legal & General Investment Management asks that all of its portfolio companies have at least one board director focused on sustainability or they risk a protest vote. According to José Angel Tejero, Acciona's chief finance officer who has taken over the sustainability team, the decision to merge the roles was in part to address this growing demand from investors.    But it was also born from the recognition that the opportunities to gain a competitive edge with sustainable initiatives are growing; not just in new products and services, but in debt finance that pegs interest rates to whether a company meets or misses ESG targets. For many companies, ensuring the new ESG lending conditions are realistic, and can be measured and met, is a new discipline especially when the world is divided over standards for sustainability reporting. Which is why it makes sense for Acciona and others to integrate sustainability with finance. After all, it is the finance department that manages risk, sets budgets and distils the information that guides investment decisions. Mervyn King, a South African who is chair emeritus of the International Integrated Reporting Council, argues that the CFO is the ""true change maker"" of a company. Not all companies will choose to hand oversight to the finance director. But their boards will have to assume greater responsibility to reassure the investment community that there is top-level accountability. Worryingly, PwC's last annual corporate directors survey found that more than half the board members questioned admitted that ESG was not regularly addressed at meetings, while close to 60 per cent did not believe disclosure should be a priority. These are no longer sustainable attitudes. Unless company boards demonstrate willingness to be directly accountable for oversight of sustainability, investors may question their commitment to change. peggy.hollinger@ft.com Giving ESG oversight to the finance chief is so rare that those who advocate such integration struggle to find another example"
5423f2c63e40c5e92d73,2021-05-06,BlackRock hits flak over stance in P&G palm oil revolt,"Fund house backed sourcing protest ? Stake held in Indonesian supplier BlackRock has been accused of inconsistency for supporting a shareholder protest against Procter & Gamble's sourcing of palm oil from an Indonesian company in which BlackRock itself holds a significant stake. The biggest investment group, which has made ambitious commitments to environmental, social and governance standards, joined a rebellion at P&G in October over the group's wood pulp and palm oil supply chain. P&G has since asked its Singaporebased supplier Wilmar International to probe Astra Agro Lestari, a palm oil unit of Indonesian conglomerate Astra International which activists have accused of seizing land from local farmers among other poor environmental standards. Rights groups and sustainable investment advocates have turned attention to BlackRock, which is a significant shareholder in Astra International. According to Bloomberg data, the fund group is Astra International's third-largest investor, with a holding worth almost $350m. It also has a small holding in Astra Agro Lestari. Green groups said BlackRock had been inconsistent in its approach to ESG by not openly pressing Astra on its record. The fund house has come under growing pressure to live up to its pledges regarding ESG and sustainable investing. ""It's incoherent that BlackRock is pushing P&G to clean up its value chain while simultaneously continuing to profit from this same value chain,"" said Lara Cuvelier at Reclaim Finance. The issue at Astra is a stark example of the problems facing large passive investors such as BlackRock as they grapple with the rise of ESG investing. Unlike active investors such as Capital Group, BlackRock cannot easily sell its holdings of a company across its index and exchange traded funds if it believes there are problems with the business. BlackRock has long argued that behind-the-scenes conversations will drive change, but critics argue that companies often only listen to the ""ultimate sanction"" of divestment. Wilmar's probe into Astra Agro Lestari stemmed from a request in October by Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia, an environmental group, for P&G to look into claims that three units of the palm oil company were involved in land grabs. The alleged seizures took place in seven villages in Central Sulawesi. Astra International is majorityowned by Hong Kong trading house Jardine Matheson through its Singaporelisted unit, Jardine Cycle and Carriage. BlackRock's shareholding, which has gradually increased over nine years, is mostly held through mutual funds and ETFs, according to Bloomberg data. Astra International did not respond directly to the allegations, but said it was working with its subsidiaries on sustainability and the livelihood of local communities. P&G said Astra Agro Lestari sold palm materials to Wilmar, one of the consumer goods group's suppliers. ""We asked Wilmar to take steps to investigate further ... and address the case,"" P&G said. Wilmar said Astra Agro Lestari had so far been ""forthcoming and open"" in its investigation.    BlackRock said it was ""well aware"" of the concerns and was ""continuously engaged"" with companies over sustainability concerns.

c8e69e3792400b95d17e,2021-05-06,Western companies in China succumb to Stockholm syndrome,"Stockholm syndrome, named after a notorious robbery in the Swedish capital in 1973, is a phenomenon in which the victim of kidnapping or hostage-taking develops feelings of trust, affection or sympathy for their captor. It is a condition that afflicts much of the corporate world and some governments when it comes to their dealings with the Chinese Communist party. I was recently invited by a group of Hong Kong-based international business executives to discuss Beijing's moves to crush the last vestiges of democracy and free speech in the territory. Several of these executives from democratic societies said they viewed the free press as their greatest enemy. To them the problem was not the erosion of rights and freedoms in what was one of the world's most dynamic financial centres. The problem was pesky journalists who dared to report on these developments, thereby convincing head office to stop investing in the city. It may sound strange to describe successful, moneymaking ventures in China as hostages. But in their daily operations, many of these companies face intellectual property theft, unpredictable and predatory policymaking, intrusive surveillance by secret police and the threat of exit bans or even employee arrest arising from ordinary business disputes. Because Beijing has punished so many companies and countries for a range of perceived political slights from quoting the Dalai Lama in marketing campaigns, to shunning cotton allegedly harvested by slave labour many international companies in China do feel like hostages. But they tend to blame politicians, media or human rights groups in their home countries for antagonising their captors. Companies like Volkswagen, Apple, Starbucks, Nike, Intel, Qualcomm, General Motors and H&M are all reliant on the huge and growing Chinese market. Various western companies, including several of these, have lobbied in public or in private on behalf of the same government that holds them to ransom in China. Some have been punished all the same. Most recently, companies including H&M and Nike, were subjected to state-organised consumer boycotts for their refusal to use cotton allegedly produced using Muslim Uyghur slave labour in western China. Unfortunately for companies heavily reliant on China, it is no longer enough to stay quiet about human rights abuses, unfair business practices or political interference. If you want to make money in modern China you have to toe the Communist party's line, engage in ostentatious displays of fealty and assist in its propaganda efforts globally. In a speech last year, President Xi Jinping made clear he wants to increase this leverage, saying the party ""must tighten the dependence of international production chains on China"" in order to form a ""powerful countermeasure and deterrent capability"". The environmental, social and governance movement sweeping through many companies in the west makes their situation in China even harder. What exactly is the ESG policy of these companies when it comes to ""genocide"", as the US State Department and the parliaments of Canada, the Netherlands and UK have described the situation in Xinjiang? Senator Marco Rubio of    Florida has a point when he calls Delta Air Lines ""the height of hypocrisy"" for opposing voter legislation in the US state of Georgia while partnering with a government he accuses of being ""actively engaged in genocide"" in Xinjiang. Delta is a shareholder in stateowned China Eastern Airlines. The hypocrisy and symptoms of Stockholm syndrome are not unique to companies. New Zealand's government has been admired in many parts of the world as a paragon of progressive values. But when it comes to China, the country's ""independent, values-based"" foreign policy appears to be premised more on fear and greed. Even before China imposed unofficial sanctions on Australia for daring to call for a genuine investigation into the origins of the pandemic, Wellington went out of its way not to offend Beijing. The country's foreign minister has even called into question the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement that has existed between the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand since the second world war. Presumably the goal was to sell a bit more milk powder into the Chinese market. This prompted horror in other western capitals and outpourings of delight from Chinese state media. What the government of New Zealand and many others seem to forget is that acquiescing to the demands of kidnappers only encourages them to take more prisoners. jamil.anderlini@ft.com Firms feel like hostages because Beijing punishes so many others for perceived political slights"
7eb9117875f65392f053,2021-05-06,Palm oil/BlackRock: bungle in the jungle,"Twitter: @FTLex From Oreo cookies to shaving cream, palm oil is an ingredient in all our daily lives. Production continues to grow about 72m metric tonnes last year. Its omnipresence exposes avowedly ethical investors such as BlackRock to charges of hypocrisy. Plantation operators sometimes destroy rainforest or wrest land from small farmers. An environmental group has levelled the latter allegation at a subsidiary of Astra International, an Indonesian company whose third-largest shareholder is the US passive specialist. The claim is awkward for BlackRock, which participated last year in a shareholder revolt over aspects of Procter & Gamble's supply chain. The US consumer products giant says it sources ""palm oil materials"" from a wholesaler that buys in turn from the unit, Astra Agro Lestari. Parent Astra is majority-owned by trading house Jardine Matheson and has a strong business record. Over 64 years, it has become one of Indonesia's largest listed conglomerates. Its activities are far from environmentally-friendly. Three quarters of sales come from cars, mining and mining equipment. Astra subsidiary United Tractors bought a majority stake in Indonesia's Martabe Gold Mine. That worked out well financially. But environmental campaigners claim the Sumatra mine overlaps with the habitat of Tapanuli orang-utans, which face extinction. Citigroup cut financing to Indonesian agribusiness company Indofood after it failed to meet sustainable palm oil standards. Disinvesting from Astra would be harder for BlackRock as a primarily passive manager. It bangs the drum for responsible investment. But it may not be able to sell shares in controversial companies when they are index constituents. Astra trades at 12 times forward earnings, a steep discount to the region's auto and heavy equipment peers. Its old-school businesses have hit a profit wall. Sales fell 26 per cent last year to a decade low. Further weakness and the growing power of the ESG movement could cast a shadow on Jardine Matheson too. Astra accounts for nearly a fifth of Jardine's underlying profit."
ffac10f90293faa8b32c,2021-05-06,Jabre scion launches ESG fund to tap into demand for 'conscious capitalism',"Asset management The son of Philippe Jabre, a star of Europe's hedge fund industry in the early 2000s, has entered the family business with a fund focused on ""conscious capitalism"", underscoring the generational shift taking place in asset management. Philippe, 60, was a top hedge fund manager at GLG Partners in London, but in 2006 received a then-record fine for an individual of £750,000 from the UK regulator for trading on confidential information, although authorities stopped short of calling his actions intentional. He moved to Geneva to set up Jabre Capital, which raised billions of dollars in assets. Now, 34-year-old Michel Jabre has launched a fund at Jabre Capital seeking to capitalise on demand for sustainable and environmentally-focused strategies, investing in areas such as renewable energy, electric vehicles and online education that he thinks will thrive and benefit society as a whole. ""Our overarching philosophy is based on conscious capitalism, whereby businesses should serve all stakeholders, including employees, humanity, the environment, not just the ones they've historically served the management team and shareholders,"" said Michel in an interview with the Financial Times. Jabre Capital made strong returns after the financial crisis, but said in 2018 it would return outside money to clients after suffering heavy losses. After the closure of Jabre Capital's funds, Michel, who had been running a small portfolio, took nine months off ""to think, relax, read a lot and travel"". ""I explored concepts around impact invest- ing, [and] sustainability,"" added Michel, who said at a recent conference that he ""had been deeply put off by all the greed I had seen in the financial system"". Michel rejoined Jabre Capital in late 2019 and his fund was launched last summer as part of the firm's relaunch into managing funds for outside investors. The fund, which invests in small and mid-cap stocks, does not short sell but does use derivatives to hedge its positions. It also gives 22 per cent of its performance fees to charities and nongovernmental organisations. His father Philippe is also an active philanthropist. Hedge funds have been slow to move into sustainability-focused investing, but have spotted moneymaking opportunities and the chance to attract investors. Michel said he was relaxed about the asset management industry's so-called 'greenwashing' using environmental concerns as an advertising gimmick of investments, which critics argue undermines genuine efforts to make the sector more sustainable. ""Greenwashing doesn't matter, it's still pushing people in that direction,"" he said. ""Whether people are authentic or not, the conversation is still moving in that direction."""
e0b04ec5d7b9462d1bfe,2021-05-06,Investors should be wary of ESG virtue signalling,"Letters Maybe we shouldn't take the conclusions from Scientific Beta that environmental, social and governance stocks fail to outperform too seriously (""ESG outperformance narrative 'is flawed', new research shows"", Report, FT.com, May 3). First of all, it is far from clear that all corporations that make it into current ESG lists deserve to be there. The reported analysis could easily have been skewed by ESG assessments that merely represent a meaningless virtue-signalling veneer rather than the real thing. Second, investors invest on the basis of perceived future potential rather than past performance. As political pressures continue to mount and ESG evaluations become more discriminating, it seems likely that those corporations that are truly ahead on ESG skills will in fact outperform. Rather than ignoring ESG as an investment consideration, the real lesson from the analysis could as easily be that investors should be more discriminating in how they assess corporate capabilities rather than swallowing hook, line and sinker evaluations from investment houses desperately inflating their so-called ESG portfolios to meet the huge surge in investor demand.

bdd0948da6928eb6c5a0,2021-05-05,Ex-Tullow chief lured by majors' African retreat,"Oil & gas McDade likens prospects on the continent to the North Sea 20 years ago Tullow Oil's former chief executive is launching an Africa-focused venture aimed at capitalising on energy majors' plans to scale back production. Paul McDade, who spent almost two decades at Tullow as chief operating officer then chief executive, has led the takeover of Aim-listed Sterling Energy and will this week rebrand it Afentra, for Africa Energy Transition. The company, backed by sector investor Richard Griffiths and fund managers, is on the hunt to produce oil and gas assets in west Africa and beyond. It is betting the sector is on the cusp of significant change as companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and Total start to curb spending on fossil fuel projects. ""Who are the majors going to hand these assets to is the big question, as you want them to go to responsible operators,"" McDade said. ""At Tullow we always considered our standards should be as high as any [international oil company]. We're just going to be more nimble and lower-cost. We believe we can do that again."" McDade likened Africa to the North Sea two decades ago, when the majors' retreat from an ageing basin enabled smaller companies to take over assets. Companies including Talisman Energy and Apache Energy took mature assets off the hands of big groups and ran them for more than a decade. Afentra said Africa had a ""compelling market dynamic for agile and innovative consolidators"". McDade said it believed a host of assets of the ""right"" scale would be available, with ""many more over the next five to 10 years"". To obtain a quick public listing the company has ""backed itself in"" to Aimlisted Sterling Energy, said McDade, having acquired about 50 per cent of its shares. Ian Cloke, also formerly of Tullow, has joined as chief operating officer. Shareholders with a stake of more than 3 per cent backing the takeover included Griffiths, Kite Lake Capital Management, Hadron Capital and Athos Capital. McDade and Cloke hold about 3 per cent between them. The sole asset of Sterling Energy, which has a market capitalisation of about £36m, is a stake in an exploration project in Somaliland, the self-declared republic, alongside Genel Energy and Petrosoma. The company has about $40m of cash on its balance sheet, some of which will be initial capital alongside new equity and debt for acquisitions. McDade said that while some investors shunned oil and gas as climate change rose up the political agenda, the social and governance aspects of ESG investing risked being overlooked. ""An energy transition is happening but oil and gas will remain part of the energy mix, particularly in developing countries,"" he said.    ""You want responsible operators, otherwise there's a risk emissions actually rise when the IOCs sell assets on. If we acquire something that has high emissions, we need to look for ways to reduce them."" The company was also looking at discovered but undeveloped assets potential fields that have been found but never brought on to production. ""Early on, we're very much going to be looking at producing assets but there is this opportunity to acquire discovered resources with a view to developing them in parallel,"" McDade added. Afentra says Africa has a 'compelling market dynamic for agile and innovative consolidators'"

2e8c30bc6ddf319d59af,2021-04-29,Wall Street beware: the SEC's Gensler carries a big stick,"BUSINESS Brooke Masters T he last time Gary Gensler ran an American financial regulator, he was charged with cleaning up the mess left by the 2008 crash. Now the new chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission faces a rather different task: policing volatile and frothy markets that may be hiding all kinds of misbehaviour. Frenzied dealmaking and trading, cheap financing and hybrid working have created a perfect storm of opportunities for fraudsters. The pressure is on Gensler and his enforcement chief Alex Oh to clamp down and deflate any bubbles before they burst. They take over an SEC that is struggling with homeworking, and overwhelmed with new filings for initial public offerings and special acquisition companies known as Spacs. It is also under fire from critics who say that the previous chair Jay Clayton's focus on Main Street investors left Wall Street dangerously unfettered. Total enforcement cases dropped to a six-year low in the 2020 fiscal year, although the SEC collected a record $4.7bn in remedies. At worst, we could see a repeat of 2001, when the dotcom bust revealed monstrous accounting and Wall Street scandals that undermined public confidence. Then-SEC chair, Harvey Pitt, a financial industry lawyer, was slow to address public anger, which ultimately cost him the job. Gensler, who started his career at Goldman Sachs, is unlikely to make the same mistake. While chair of the smaller Commodity Futures Trading Commission, he was routinely described as ""aggressive"" and ""hated"" as he pushed through post-crisis rules and forced big banks to cough up billions for rigging foreign exchange benchmarks and the bank funding rate Libor. ""Gary got the job for a number of reasons, one undoubtedly being to lead a robust enforcement programme with impact. Based on my time working for him, I expect he is going to do just that,"" says David Meister, former CFTC enforcement director. The choice of Oh reinforces the sense that Gensler will play hardball. As a securities fraud prosecutor, she had an uncompromising approach to settlement negotiations. ""This is not a crowd with a sense of humour and they are going to be very aggressive,"" says one defence lawyer. ""They are out looking for problems rather than having them land on their doorstep."" Still, it is vital their pugnaciousness is channelled in the right direction. If the SEC oversteps, it could end up with court losses that curtail its powers. Just look at the Federal Trade Commission: last week, the Supreme Court unanimously slashed its ability to seek cash redress from companies. So what will they do first? After Gensler was selected, but before his confirmation, the SEC took three notable steps: it freed up staff to send subpoenas without having to ask permission from the five-member commission; sent Wall Street firms a broad request for information about Spacs; and set up a task force aimed at sniffing out companies that are misleading investors about their environmental, social and governance impact. Looser subpoena rules are typically used by (mostly Democratic) SEC chairs to embolden staff and signal that the agency is on the prowl. On Spacs, they'll be looking for undisclosed conflicts of interest among the banks,    private equity firms and celebrities who are bringing these blank-cheque vehicles to market. They will also be running a microscope over the promises Spacs make when they later merge with private companies. If the SEC finds signs that the banks and sponsors were using financial projections they did not believe or failed to check, it could bring cases like those that saw Wall Street banks pay billions for misleading investors about dotcom IPOs. Finding ESG violations could be hard, as there are no specific disclosure rules. When New York state enforcers brought a climate claim against Exxon- Mobil in 2019, they lost badly. Still, don't expect the SEC to stop there. The frenzy around GameStop and other meme stocks has raised concerns that trading apps such as Robinhood are mistreating small customers. A new rule requiring brokers to act in customers' best interest needs enforcing. And the Archegos collapse, which cost big banks more than $10bn, points to a need to puncture the secrecy around family offices and the derivatives that they use. These problems may lead to tighter regulation. But crafting a measured response takes time. High profile, bigdollar enforcement cases are a quicker way to change behaviour. Look for Gensler to exploit that to the full. brooke.masters@ft.com Frenzied dealmaking and cheap financing have created a perfect storm of opportunities for fraudsters"
4254599ccc8d50ce68c4,2021-04-29,Thematic indices: trend alert,"Twitter: @FTLex Back to front as it sounds, MSCI is following the money. The global securities index publisher has launched a deck of indices allowing both domestic and international funds to track Chinese megatrends. Normally, funds follow indices. Some $14.5tn worth of funds benchmark MSCI indices alone. But thematic investing that focuses on long-term trends rather than specific companies or sectors is already popular. Globally there was $170bn of assets under management in passive thematic funds as at end of the first quarter, almost treble the year-ago level, according to Morningstar. In China, more than half the passive funds offered onshore were thematic, says Z-Ben, a consultancy. Investing in megatrends thus sounds like a mega no-brainer. But there are a few cavils. Megatrends, almost by definition, are backward looking. Those themes targeting robotics or renewables, say, are attached to growing markets but ones that are at least partially reflected in share prices. China's smart cities the subject of one MSCI index continue to proliferate but have already enjoyed a decent ride. Even in 2018, local consulting firms (perhaps bullishly) reckoned the market was worth $1.1tn. They are also very broad categories. Even narrow sounding funds have expansive remits: a fund invested in batteries could span itsy Peruvian miners to $676bn market-valued Tesla. MSCI demonstrates the breadth. Its Accelerated Change benchmark ranges from tech to biotech to clean tech. The China autonomous technology and industrial innovation index includes companies best known for search engines and ecommerce. By allying with Beijing's strategic goals MSCI's Chinese versions may at least avoid the fate of more fad-driven funds, which often struggle to sustain initial stellar outperformances. In their place comes political risk that could chafe with more ESG-focused investors, particularly in the US. Sino-US tension is, after all, another megatrend."
168a713ec8fa1a67a54e,2021-04-27,ESG rush opens opportunities in 'sin stocks',"I n the next decade, an ungodly amount of money is going to be made out of environmental, social and governance-oriented investing. Unfortunately, much of it will probably be made by betting against the angels. The ESG phenomenon is unquestionably one of the most powerful forces in markets at the moment with investment groups locked in a frenzied game of one-upmanship, each competing to take ESG more seriously than the next or at least appear to do so. Setting aside the moral imperatives, the commercial rationale is clear. ESG funds have attracted about $340bn over the past two years, according to EPFR, almost twice as much as the rest of the stock fund universe combined. This is positive. Market signals matter in a capitalist system and, right now, markets are screaming at companies to get their act together sometimes in admittedly weird ways. Volkswagen's ham-fisted April Fools' Day joke that it was renaming itself ""Voltswagen"" to tout its electric vehicle credentials lifted its stock more than 12 per cent. But investors who have been lulled by optimistic backtests and wishful thinking into assuming they can do well from doing good could end up disappointed. History offers some clues. A seminal 2008 paper led by finance professor Frank Fabozzi examined the impact of investor aversion to companies in industries such as tobacco and gambling. It found that ""sin stocks"" generated excess returns in all 21 countries studied in the 1970-2007 period and double-digit returns in 16 of them. The results were corroborated in another study by Harrison Hong and Marcin Kacperczyk, which found that less ""norm-constrained"" investors such as hedge funds reaped the benefits of while pension plans lost out. There are many reasons for this. Because some investors avoid them, sin stocks are systematically cheaper than their fundamentals would suggest. Sinful industries enjoy what are in effect ""societal moats"" as new competitors would struggle to raise capital. That protection against normal competitive pressures allows them to reap bigger profits. The corollary to divestment campaigns that raise the cost of capital for controversial companies is an increase in return for investors willing to ignore the social opprobrium that they might incur. The idea of a ""sin premium"" that socially obtuse investors can harvest is now being challenged. Recent research indicates that tilting towards stocks that score better on ESG metrics is, at worst, neutral for returns. Some studies find they actually enhance performance. In other words, investors can have their cake and eat it too. The argument is that diverse, enlightened and well-governed companies that care about the environment are generally well run and the stocks of well-run companies tend to do better long term. The data seem to bear this out. MSCI's global index of ""ESG leaders"" has returned 164 per cent over the past decade, actually narrowly outperforming the conventional gauge it is designed to mimic. A recent NYU paper    found that a majority of more than 200 ESG studies published since 2015 concluded that ESG boosted returns. Even Fabozzi revisited his paper in 2017 and found that the positive performance of sin stocks faded once one adjusted for factors such as the size of companies. The problem is that, when one wants to find a pattern in the data, such as how doing good enhances returns, it is tempting to contort the data to show it or not to interrogate it sufficiently critically. The past decade has been phenomenally good for stocks that score well on ESG metrics (technology) and phenomenally bad for stocks that score badly (energy). Then these data generate their own momentum as investors chase strategies that promise both saving the planet and generating extra returns in the process. The result is that investors bemoan the paucity of decent investment opportunities but will invest in Tesla at 1,000 times its expected earnings or lend money to Greece for 30 years at less than 2 per cent a year, while blanching at taking a punt on ExxonMobil's 6 per cent dividend yield. An apples-to-pears comparison but still illustrative of an eye-catching phenomenon. This leaves an enormous opportunity for norm-agnostic investors willing to lean against the ESG wave. If public markets continue to become inhospitable to iffier companies, private equity is likely to be a big beneficiary. This should not be construed as an argument against the importance of ESG investing per se. But sometimes, virtue has to be its own reward. robin.wigglesworth@ft.com If public markets continue to become inhospitable to iffier companies, private equity is likely to benefit"
73eb050664c7ea38822a,2021-04-27,European sustainable fund inflows surpass all other ETFs for first time,"Equities Inflows into self-proclaimed ""sustainable"" exchange traded funds overtook those into all other ETFs for the first time in Europe in the first quarter of the year. Assets in passive funds tracking indices based on environmental, social and governance principles jumped from $59bn to $174bn last year, according to data from TrackInsight. Flows accelerated still further in the first three months of this year with the record $25.8bn taken in by funds in Europe exceeding the $22.3bn collected by non-ESG ETFs for the first time, according to data from Morningstar. As recently as 2019, these strategies accounted for just a sixth of new money heading into ETFs. ""There has been a significant increase in flows into ESG products in the last two quarters and this is expected to continue, supported by new money and by a rotation from non-ESG investments into ESG alternatives,"" said Jose Garcia-Zarate, associate director, passive strategies research at Morningstar. The figures came days after the Biden administration pledged to halve US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 at a virtual summit. Canada, Japan and South Korea also made new climate commitments, signalling growing global consensus on environmental policy a core pillar of this investment strategy. President Xi Jinping also pledged to ""phase down"" coal consumption in the five years from 2025, the first time China's government has committed to reduce its use of the fossil fuel. ""A lot of investors are going into sustainable investing,"" Garcia-Zarate said. ""ESG is becoming the new normal. We are at the beginning of this journey."" Sustainability-focused strategies have risen to account for more than 10 per cent of the ETF market in Europe for the first time, the Morningstar data show. The picture looks different in the US, which has lagged Europe on the sustainable investment agenda. Sustainable ETFs accounted for just $7.6bn, or 3.1 per cent, of the record $248bn that flowed into all index funds in the first quarter of the year. However, ESG is starting to make headway there with the BlackRock US Carbon Transition Readiness ETF breaking global records for first-day inflows for any ETF when it took in $1.25bn earlier this month. Amin Rajan, founder of Create Research, a consultancy, said the strong performance of ESG index funds during the pandemic market sell-off last year meant demand would continue. ""[People worried] how they were likely to fare in a market correction and that question was answered with ESG funds performing much better than anyone expected,"" Rajan said.    The investment strategy still has challenges, partly relating to the risk of exaggerated or false environmental promises, known as greenwashing. ""Are companies improving their carbon footprint? There is so much greenwashing. I don't know if there are many governance improvements going on,"" Rajan added. 'A lot of investors are going into sustainable investing.

Four in 10 shareholders voted against the company's pay plan, punishing the estate agent for awarding a bonus to its chief executive for a year in which it received almost £7m in government support, raised emergency cash and suffered a substantial share price fall. The revolt came after a series of big investors, from Legal and General Investment Management to Fidelity International , urged companies to show restraint around executive pay this year, particularly if they had been hard hit by the pandemic. While many businesses have taken on board shareholders' warnings, others have not — setting the scene for a tense annual meeting season. Other companies in the spotlight over pay include BAE Systems , which handed its chief executive £2m to stay at the business; AstraZeneca because of its decision to increase the maximum long-term incentive plan (LTIP) that chief executive Pascal Soriot could receive; and British American Tobacco , over salary rises for executives. One senior figure at a large UK asset manager said the Foxtons vote showed shareholders had no qualms about holding companies to account over pay in 2020. ""Foxtons' AGM result should serve as a warning to the market. Bonuses should be off the table for companies that have only survived through government handouts, cutting dividends and furloughing staff,"" he said. Shareholders normally overwhelmingly back pay resolutions. Last year, only 5.2 per cent of shareholders on average voted against the pay report at UK AGMs, according to Proxy Insight, a data provider. But this time is already looking more fraught, with big votes against pay at companies from Hollywood Bowl to Cineworld. Angeli Benham, senior global environmental, social and governance manager at LGIM, said if companies had taken government or shareholder support, investors would expect them to ""show restraint and not continue to pay bonuses"". Although still early in the AGM season, shareholders and advisers to investors have flagged several businesses where they have concerns about remuneration. These include National Express , the public transport company, where proxy adviser Glass Lewis criticised plans for a large salary increase for the chief financial officer despite the company not repaying government support, stopping dividends and its share price falling. National Express said the CFO's overall pay was down substantially in 2020 and would be lower again this year. Glass Lewis also advised shareholders to rebel against Sig, the building materials group, arguing the company's decisions around executive pay were out of kilter with the experience of shareholders and employees, of which about 20,000 were furloughed. Institutional Shareholder Services , the world's largest proxy adviser, has urged a vote against pay at insurer Lancashire Group over executive bonuses, and at Vitec, a small-cap company.    Mirza Baig, global head of ESG research and stewardship at Aviva Investors , the £366bn UK fund manager, said that as well as bonuses, companies needed to think carefully about pay rises. ""Now is not the time to be handing out salary increases to already well paid executives,"" he said. BAT increased chief executive Jack Bowles 's salary by 3 per cent this year, following a 9.5 per cent increase in 2020, which led to revolt at last year's annual meeting. ""Following last year's vote on the remuneration report at the AGM, we have engaged with our shareholders to understand their views in shaping remuneration decisions for 2021,"" the company said. Another area of concern for shareholders is the introduction of so-called restricted share plans, a type of longterm incentive scheme. Unlike the more usual long-term incentive plan, where awards are based on various performance metrics, under a restricted share scheme executives are typically given a smaller but guaranteed number of shares that they have to hold for several years. Investors are worried that some companies are moving towards restricted shares to ensure executives continue to enjoy bumper pay packages at a time when meeting performance conditions is more challenging because of the pandemic. ""What we don't want is companies implementing restricted share plans in bad times, but returning to LTIPs in good times,"" said Jenn-Hui Tan, global head of stewardship at Fidelity . ""It needs to be the right model of pay."" ISS has urged shareholders to vote against plans for a one-off restricted share scheme at Hostelworld. Glencore has also been criticised by proxy advisers over its new restricted share plan and changes to executive pay. Investors also have their eyes on socalled ""windfall gains"", after some companies awarded shares or options to executives during last year's market plunge. If share prices rebound over the next few years, executives would reap the rewards. ""The Covid dip is a classic that needs to be watched out for,"" said Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship, EOS at Federated Hermes. Ashley Hamilton Claxton , head of responsible investment at Royal London Asset Management , said she was paying close attention to sectors badly affected by the pandemic, such as travel and hospitality. But she added: ""If a company managed its situation well, if profits are up, employees haven't been laid off and shareholders have benefited, there is no reason to say it wouldn't be appropriate to pay a bonus."" For companies that have managed less well, investors are ready to punish the directors who fail to keep remuneration under control. At Foxtons, a third of shareholders voted against the re-election of Alan Giles , remuneration committee chair, and 17 per cent against chief executive Nic Budden . Baig said that could happen at other companies if boards failed to listen to their shareholders."

e81092cfc8d45979c3a7,2021-04-26,Low-income countries play carbon leapfrog,"Developing nations Vietnam's wind farms are driving its green energy shift, writes Patrick Mulholland Just as Brazil's rivers supply it with hydroelectric power, and faults in the earth's crust provide Indonesia with geothermal energy, so Vietnam hopes abundant sunshine and a shallow coast will provide clean energy to drive its economic growth. Like many low- and middle-income countries, it is under pressure to generate sufficient energy to power its industries while keeping the economy as green as possible. In Vietnam, a country of almost 100m people that saw gross domestic product growth of 7 per cent in 2019, energy consumption has more than doubled since 2010 although the average Vietnamese uses half as much electricity as someone in neighbouring China. But efforts by smaller, industrialising nations can still make a big difference in the fight against climate change. ""Adding a renewable project into a developing country's power grid tends to offset or replace a higher proportion of fossil fuels than it would in a developed country,"" explains Steve Liberatore, head of ESG fixed income strategies at Nuveen, an asset manager. The UN's Emissions Gap Report 2020 says that success in managing the transition to green energy could lead to developing countries leapfrogging beyond the carbon-intensive technologies that underpin wealthier nations. In Vietnam's case, the sea off its southern coast is ideal for placing offshore wind turbines, which are crucial to the south-east Asian country's plan to increase its proportion of power from wind and solar from 10 per cent in 2019 to 42 per cent by 2045. ""To illustrate how impressive Vietnam's renewable energy adoption has been ... [it] did not have any utilityscale solar power until 2018, and very little wind,"" says Thu Vu, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an Ohio think-tank. However, the draft version of PDP8, Vietnam's national power development plan, has underestimated the pace of its energy transition, says Vu. According to data from Irena, an intergovernmental renewable energy organisation, Vietnam's production from solar and wind increased 237 per cent and 60 per cent respectively in 2020, raising the share of these sources to a quarter almost a decade ahead of schedule. Although most of its existing wind projects are located onshore, restrictions on available land mean the bulk of Vietnam's windpower gains will have to come from offshore wind farms, says the Danish Energy Agency, which advises the Vietnamese government. Vietnam's southern coast does not lack wind. With average speeds of more than 10 metres a second force six on the Beaufort scale its territorial waters rank in the top 10 per cent of the windiest places on the planet.    ""Many other countries in the region also have good wind speeds but they are limited by deep seas,"" says Adrian Dempsey, Asia-Pacific chief financial officer at Mainstream Renewable Power, an Irish energy company with operations in Vietnam. The seas off the provinces of Binh Thuan and Soc Trang where developers including Mainstream plan to build multibillion-dollar offshore wind farms are also relatively shallow, with depths of 20 metres to 50 metres. According to the World Bank, developing Vietnam's maritime assets could produce 475GW of electricity a year about 20 times the country's total potential capacity for onshore wind power. Yet, despite its potential to supply Vietnam's energy needs, few largescale offshore projects have been added under the proposed PDP8 mainly because of regulatory complexity and investment risk. ""The 2030 target for offshore wind is limited at 2GW-3GW, [which] reflects the government's scepticism for now,"" says Vu, noting the higher cost of offshore units relative to onshore or nearshore wind. To reduce costs, Vietnam must improve its infrastructure, says Ian Hatton, chair of Enterprize Energy, a UK-renewable energy company. It could do this by linking up the energy-charged south to its northern cities, building substations and laying cables along the seabed for offshore production, or finding alternative solutions. Enterprize is experimenting with converting wind energy and seawater to hydrogen. However, the country's renewables industry is also a victim of its own success. In 2019, a government feed-in-tariff incentive led to the addition of 4.46GW from 82 solar plants an oversupply that forced plants to cut output. It is an example of the dilemma facing low- and middle-income nations such as Vietnam: if they produce enough energy to meet demand without improving transmission infrastructure, additional capacity could be squandered. According to the Vietnamese government, upgrading its infrastructure and adding generation capacity would require investment of $128.3bn in the next decade, including funding from abroad. But William Gaillard, vice-president of wind turbine manufacturer Vestas, believes Vietnam has ""shown a path for others to follow."" He says: ""The combination of an attractive feed-intariff with ambitious installation targets and a transparent permitting process has been a critical factor in unlocking this market."" Vietnam did not have any utility-scale solar power until 2018, and very little wind power Thu Vu, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis"
419e5fa916f361b47261,2021-04-22,"For all their fine words, bosses are not sharing the pain","W e are all in this together, corporate bosses told us last year as they promised to forgo parts of their salaries or bonuses in recognition of the havoc wreaked by Covid-19. By the end of last June, 502 US listed companies, 17 per cent of the Russell 3000, had announced ""adjustments"" to the pay of their chief executives. Retailers, travel groups and manufacturers were most likely to trumpet their leaders' willingness to share the pain. It's part of a larger shift in corporate culture that has seen US chiefs speak out on important issues ranging from voting rights and racial inequality to climate change. Last year, nearly 19 per cent of large public companies worldwide included some sort of environmental or social target in their executive pay plan, double the share in 2017, says ISS ESG, the proxy adviser's data arm. While some adherents of ""stakeholder capitalism"" may be true believers, others are using the doctrine as a marketing ploy and a way to avoid investor pressure for results. Taking personal salary cuts during the pandemic last year allowed corporate leaders to literally put their money where their mouths were. But, executives being executives, the bottom line on CEO pay turns out to be rather different than the early headlines suggested. Rather than shrinking, the median CEO pay package for Russell 3000 companies rose by 6 per cent last year, according to ISS ESG. At the largest businesses, the median pay pot of S&P 500 CEOs, including bonuses and long-term shares, hit $13.3m in 2020, marking the 11th straight annual increase. Top executives also used corporate jets more extensively for personal travel, corporate disclosures show. By contrast, median employee pay at S&P 500 companies dropped 17 per cent last year, so the ratio of CEO pay to employee pay shot up from 182 to 227. This was largely a US phenomenon. Most European and UK chiefs took Covid pay cuts alongside their workers: the median pay package for Stoxx 600 and FTSE 100 chiefs each fell 18 per cent to about $3m. US pay plans have always depended more on shares, and stocks there have been on a tear, thanks to central bank support and rapid vaccine rollout. The S&P firmly returned to pre-pandemic levels in November and has since hit a series of new highs. The Euro Stoxx and FTSE 100 finally recovered their Covid losses last week. But that is not the whole story. Some companies have been playing fast and loose with pay rules to reward top executives when targets were missed. Fast food group Chipotle, for example, excluded three months of lockdown (March, April and May) from its calculation of key metrics as well as some Covid-related expenses, ISS says, adding that the changes boosted CEO Brian Niccol's total pay by $23.6m to $38m. Others have shifted from absolute targets to performance relative to peers, a measure that can still pay out in years with losses. ""It's a challenge for compensation committees,"" says Courtney Yu, director of research at pay data group Equilar. ""How do you incentivise executives to see this thing through and pull your company out?""    Investors, quite rightly, are taking a rather dim view of such changes. Most executive pay plans still sail through annual general meetings, as at Intuit, which won praise for capping payouts and not resetting targets. But a growing number are running into stiff opposition over size, vague targets or a sense that management has been given a free pass. So far, 86 big US companies have held AGMs, and almost 9 per cent of pay plans have failed or received less than 60 per cent support, up from 5 per cent this time last year, Equilar says. Investors voted down pay plans at Walgreens Boots Alliance, which said it would be ""unfair and unwise to penalise"" the executive team for Covid, and Starbucks, where the issue was a $50m retention bonus for chief Kevin Johnson. Rebellions are also brewing at companies such as General Electric, AT&T and Wells Fargo. Johnson & Johnson shareholders will vote on Thursday on rewarding Alex Gorsky with $29.6m for ""strategic performance"" even though the drugmaker missed most financial targets and shelled out billions over opioids and talcum powder asbestos claims. The UK is not immune: National Express, Glencore and AstraZeneca will vote shortly on pay plans that proxy adviser Glass Lewis considers excessive or disconnected from Covid reality. CEOs can talk until the cows come home about corporate responsibility. Until companies and shareholders put a stop to ""heads I win, tails I still win"" pay plans, we should not believe them. brooke.masters@ft.com Rather than shrinking, the median CEO pay package for Russell 3000 firms rose by 6 per cent last year"
0da7b215ff291daf72bb,2021-04-16,Europe makes an underappreciated corporate comeback,"T he US and China have been at the forefront of the key trends this century: trade wars, technology frontiers, economic growth and beyond. Europe has spent the past 20 years languishing with inferior progress, relatively unloved by investors. Global gross domestic product has grown 160 per cent over two decades while the continent has suffered lacklustre growth with GDP rising only 90 per cent. Europe's share in the value of global equity markets has almost halved over the past 20 years. Part of this decline has resulted from an overexposure to legacy industries such as tobacco, banks and energy as investors increasingly shifted away from traditional sector allocation. Investors have focused more on technology, thematic investing and issues related to environmental, social and corporate governance. Looking ahead, three factors will determine whether Europe will once again be relegated to third place behind the US and China: people, technology and climate action. On the first, Europe's ageing population will only become more challenging. Europe is the first and only continent to have more over-65s than under-15s and has the lowest global fertility rate at 1.6 children per woman well below the replacement threshold for developed countries of 2.1. On the second factor, technology, Europe is not faring much better. Its chronic stagnation has been hindered by under-investment in research and development. In 2000, the EU invested almost 1.7 per cent of its GDP in technological research and development while China invested about half of this at 0.9 per cent. Since then, China has almost tripled its investments while the EU's has increased to about 2 per cent in 2019. It will all hinge then on the final factor of climate action. Here, at least, Europe has a clear advantage over the US. However, the renewed US focus and China's use of the green agenda to assert economic dominance will pose new tests. Yet in the face of these challenges, Europe has undergone a dramatic market transformation over the past five years that we believe has been underestimated by investors. Europe's legacy industries have dramatically lost market share or transformed and emerged reborn as new industries. Particularly noticeable has been the fall of the European financial industry. The rise of global payment platforms, regulatory burdens and declining interest rates has contributed to banks nearly halving their weighting in market indices in five years to 7.1 per cent of equity markets at the end of 2020. The move has been so radical that, in 2020, just three payment groups, PayPal, Square and Adyen, together had a bigger market cap than the entire EU banks sector in the Stoxx Europe 600 index. Examples of European legacy industries' diminishing influence are numerous. One is that Cisco's market cap has overtaken that of the leading telecom service providers in the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland combined.    In contrast, new areas of future growth and prosperity have emerged in other old industries. Much of this relates to Europe's lead role in climate action. In 2020, Europe became the first major economic bloc to adopt targets for net zero carbon emissions and with those goals, funding, companies, technology and regulation have followed. Europe accounts for nearly 70 per cent of all ESG mutual fund assets, already derived 57 per cent of its energy from renewable sources in 2020, and eight of the top 10 clean energy groups by market cap are located there. The transition is so developed that, in 2020, the top five European fossil energy companies' combined market cap was smaller than the five largest European renewable companies. Regulation will further boost Europe's presence in this area. Policies on batteries should spur local capacity growth of nearly 30-fold by 2025 while ambitious hydrogen policies are driving the legacy chemicals industry's transformation. Europe has also seen growth in other areas. Take, for example, Ocado, which now has a market value five times larger than bricks-and-mortar retailer Marks and Spencer, while food delivery startups such as Delivery Hero have outgrown in market capitalisation large players such as Telefónica in previously dominant industries. From the land of autos, fossil fuels and tobacco has emerged a new series of high-growth companies and industries defined by tech specifically healthtech, fintech, foodtech, medtech and, of course, cleantech.

fd5df1ef3abb14e1fa28,2021-04-15,Banking regulators start climate crisis tests,"Environment Lenders are being assessed on weatherevent and energy transition risks, writes Laura Noonan O ver the past decade, financial regulators have used stress tests to measure banks' exposure to anything from losses on derivatives to fat-finger trades and cyber crime. Now, they have a more complex target in sight: assessing banks' vulnerability to the effects of climate change. This year, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are running the first thematic stress tests of their banks' exposure to everything from freak weather events to the decline of industries such as heavy manufacturing and traditional energy. In the US, the Federal Reserve has promised that climate change will have a bigger role in its annual stress tests. ""We are at the start of a critical decade for climate action where the decisions we take today will shape the future of our planet for decades to come,"" Sarah Breeden, an executive director at the BoE, told an industry gathering last summer. She said climate change, not the coronavirus pandemic, was the ""defining issue of our time"". A 2020 survey by the Bank for International Settlements, which co-ordinates work globally for the banking industry, found that 24 of 27 global regulators and supervisors had conducted some research into ""climate-related financial risks"". Fifteen of them, however, said their efforts were hampered by ""operational challenges"" and 10 said they were constrained by a lack of ""sufficiently granular or reliable"" data for their risk models. In late 2019, the BoE said the goal of this year's climate exercise would be to achieve a better understanding of the financial risks that banks face from climate change, how their business models could be affected and what they are doing to mitigate those risks. ""The BES [biennial exploratory scenario test] will focus on sizing risks rather than testing firms' capital adequacy or setting capital requirements,"" the BoE said. According to Patrick Amis, directorgeneral at the ECB with responsibility for supervising large institutions, the tests are to assess banks' ""resilience in certain scenarios and indeed to make them think about this, and make them start taking measures to adapt"". Though preliminary results point to a ""major source of systemic risk"", the ECB's final report, due in July, is unlikely to hit institutions as hard as the ECB's more familiar stress tests. Those can result in banks having to raise billions of euros in extra capital. ""In some cases, I imagine we will end up with qualitative requirements and possibly quantitative requirements if needed, but certainly not across the board,"" Amis says. Qualitative requirements cover items such as setting up better systems to assess risk and maintain data. Quantitative requirements relate to how much capital a bank needs. The Federal Reserve is less developed in its approach than the regulators in Europe or Asia, where climate-related exercises are also being carried out. Despite this, analysts at Fitch, the credit rating agency, say US regulators are ""poised to catch up to global peers"" now that the Biden administration has made climate change a top priority.    In January, the Fed created a supervision climate committee to look at the risks of climate change to individual banks. Last month, governor Lael Brainard said her officials would also create a financial stability climate committee to look at how the financial system as a whole could be affected by climate change. ""We actually are just in the very early stages of considering stress scenarios,"" Jay Powell, the Fed chair, told the House Financial Services Committee on March 23. He said the work was being done under the mandate of monitoring all risks to banks rather than a specific mandate on climate change. The detail of their mandates is at least part of what has held central banks and regulators back from taking more drastic action, such as using extra capital requirements to discourage lending to industries that damage the environment, or incentivising lending to greener projects as envisaged in the EU. Amis stresses that the ECB mandate does not extend to telling banks who they can or cannot lend to, and that the ECB's position is for risk-based measures to ""remain risk-based"". This means that higher capital requirements can be set for loans to any industry that faces climate change challenges, since the probability of default is higher. But, if there is no reason to anticipate higher default levels as is the case with most mortgages for green builds versus regular mortgages then risk-based treatments would not allow lower capital requirements for green lending. In the US, the arguments so far are more philosophical. ""It's been a longheld policy of the Fed that we don't tell banks what legal businesses they can lend to or order them to lend to,"" Powell told the March 23 committee. ""We are still some distance from disincentivising actual financial decisions,"" says Fitch analyst Mark Narron about the US efforts. They are nevertheless significant, he says. Christopher Wolfe, a colleague of Narron, says ""investors increasingly have been pushing banks"" for enhanced disclosure around climate risks. Fitch also includes environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors in its ratings metrics. ""Large US banks are already taking this very seriously,"" says Wolfe, speaking weeks after Jane Fraser, the new chief executive of Citigroup, added her bank to the list of global lenders that promise that green financing initiatives will fully offset the environmental effect of their lending to companies that add to greenhouse-gas emissions. In a blog post, Fraser described the goal of reaching ""net zero"" by 2050 not in terms of regulations but in terms of a ""climate crisis [that] is among the top critical challenges facing our global society and economy today"". Regulators may have a role but so far it is not a starring one. 'We actually are just in the very early stages of considering stress scenarios' Jay Powell, Federal Reserve chair"
7b4b5aed428396b3df85,2021-04-15,Executive pay: quantum leap,"Twitter: @FTLex Disquiet over runaway executive pay is nothing new. The pandemic has merely strengthened the case for reform. Companies propped up by the government or shareholders are first in the line of fire as voting season gets under way in the UK and US. Some investors are furious that a bonus award from UK estate agency Foxtons could pay out nearly £1m to boss Nicholas Budden. The business, which has made a pre-tax loss for the past three years, raised £22m in equity a year ago. In Italy, criticism focuses on annual remuneration worth up to €7.5m promised to Andrea Orcel, UniCredit's incoming chief executive. Shareholder adviser ISS says the package clashes with the public mood and the lender's previous pay restraint Sunlight is supposedly the best disinfectant. But these examples show that public embarrassment is an ineffective deterrent. The Lake Wobegon Effect is the main reason executive pay growth outstrips corporate performance. Chief executives, like inhabitants of the fictional Midwest town, are seemingly all above average in the view of board directors and pay consultants. Settlements at or above the mean drive pay relentlessly upwards. Companies that spend the most on remuneration consultants trigger the most pay revolts, according to shareholder adviser PIRC. Investors are slowly acknowledging that the quantum of pay matters as much as its correlation with performance. Quantum is a key test for the public of whether the ethical claims of big business trumpeted via the ESG movement are credible. The median pay of chief executives in the UK's FTSE 350 index is 53 times that of the median employee. Heavy taxpayer support for business and markets leaves boards and investors with a challenge. They must benchmark the pay of high-flying career administrators against ordinary incomes, as well as those of peers."
44a1b28ba56b18193430,2021-04-13,Hyundai faces insider trading probe linked to Apple talks,"South Korea's financial regulators are examining allegations that Hyundai Motor executives traded on inside information about the company's talks with Apple on developing an autonomous electric car, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Hyundai shares rose more than 20 per cent after it confirmed early-stage discussions with Apple in January but subsequently fell back after the group said on February 8 that it was no longer in talks with the US tech giant. After Hyundai announced the initial discussions, 12 Hyundai executives sold about 3,400 shares, worth about Won833m ($753,000), according to Reuters calculations based on the company's regulatory filings. The probe by South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service is expected to take about six months. A person close to the regulator said that the FSS was ""looking into suspicions about insider trading at Hyundai"". South Korea has tough rules against insider trading and the regulator can refer its findings to prosecutors for potential legal action. Some retail investors have questioned in online forums whether insider trading took place at Hyundai. The probe comes at a critical time for Hyundai, which has been trying to build a presence in the autonomous vehicle market through tie-ups with foreign companies. ""This is about corporate ethics. Their alleged insider trading is against the ESG moves of global companies,"" said Lee Hang-koo, an adviser at research group Korea Automotive Technology Institute. ""Its corporate image will be hurt and could have a negative impact on potential future talks with external partners."" In February, when he was asked about alleged insider trading at Hyundai, the country's top financial regulator Eun Sung-soo told a parliamentary hearing that he would ""take proper measures if there is a problem"". ""Their stock trades look quite suspicious if you look at the circumstances, but it is hard to prove that they used inside information,"" said Hwang Seiwoon, a researcher at the Korea Capital Markets Institute. ""I have hardly seen any cases where the alleged perpetrators have seriously been punished for insider trading."" Hyundai declined to comment. Shares in Hyundai closed down 1.1 per cent at Won226,000 yesterday."
a564f5dcaafe0c8a93be,2021-04-12,Kirin's flawed exit from Myanmar tests the bounds of ESG,"J ust five days after Myanmar's military seized power in early February, the Japanese brewer Kirin expressed grave concern and announced that it was terminating its five-year-old joint venture with a company controlled by the army. Superficially, Kirin's cutting of ties with MEHL Myanmar Economic Holdings looked decisive. The joint venture controls a dominant share of the fastgrowing beer market. It was the sort of lead-taking stand that appeared to put ethics over profits, and immediately raised questions about how many of the 400-plus Japanese companies operating in Myanmar would join the retreat. So far, few have, though they are scouring their supply chains for any trace of military links. The local head of the Japan External Trade Organization is clear that the perceived reputational risk has risen in recent weeks. The debate over the legitimacy of Japanese or other foreign companies remaining in business through Myanmar's misery and chaos creates a potentially stern test of the nascent environmental, social and corporate governance or ""impact"" investment narrative. The questions posed of individual companies usefully challenge the integrity of their ESG policies. Whether they possess the tools to meaningfully judge the rightness of corporate responses is unclear. The language and good intentions of ESG must demonstrate that, as a steering mechanism for at least $17tn of global investment, it does not force or justify hasty decisions. It must pass this test convincingly, as a potentially greater one is looming in China. As the violence, death toll and potential for humanitarian crisis in Myanmar have worsened, the US and UK have imposed sanctions on MEHL. Investors in Posco, which also has a joint venture with the company, have called on the Korean steelmaker to follow Kirin's example. The advocacy group Justice for Myanmar commended Kirin's ""bold and timely"" move and the message it sent to the junta. More broadly, campaigners have demanded with ever more force that multinationals and global energy companies like Chevron and France's Total reassess their behaviour, investment and presence in Myanmar. But Kirin's bold pullout is not cleancut, and it can be argued that it should have exited long before the coup drew attention to its relationship with Mehl. Early last month, Norges, Norway's $1.3tn sovereign wealth fund and one of Kirin's largest shareholders, put the Japanese brewer on its watchlist for possible portfolio exclusion. Well before the coup, a 2019 report by UN fact-finders highlighted MEHL's role in funding an army accused of the massacre of Rohingya Muslims and other egregious human rights violations. By January this year, after suspending dividend payments from its two joint ventures, Kirin said it would produce an action plan by this month, though analysts believe the emphasis was always on saving the investment rather than walking away. The coup forced Kirin's already compromised hand, and even now its primary aim is to find an alternative partner to MEHL in a process that may be impractical and drag out beyond a year rather than quit Myanmar altogether.    The conclusion of the Council on Ethics, the body that advises Norges, was especially blunt. Kirin, it said, has been aware of the risk that revenues deriving from the joint ventures could be used for military purposes from the moment it entered into the joint venture. As analysts have noted, the Norges decision could prove highly influential in an ESG-sensitive era, particularly to those with fewer resources to undertake the same depth of screening. Kirin's shareholder register is populated with funds that have made much of the new ESG influence on management style, not least BlackRock, which is the company's largest holder. The risk, given this evidence, is in holding up Kirin's deeply flawed approach as an example for others to follow on Myanmar. A swift break from anything involving MEHL (and other military-linked companies like it) is clearly vital. But Kirin should not steer the considerable momentum of ESG-themed investment to a thesis that an exit from Myanmar is the only ""right"" option, while remaining in place and generating economic activity is questionable. Among the Japanese companies in Myanmar are many that are not remotely linked with any military companies. They can argue that their presence has not only significantly improved the lives of ordinary people, but is critical to the country's chances of emerging from the deep economic hole into which it is descending post-coup. The test of ESG is whether it yet has the maturity to distinguish the corporate actions that are best for Myanmar. leo.lewis@ft.com It can be argued the group should have exited long before the coup drew attention to its brewery ties"

To be sure, the ESG agenda should be pursued with determination. But there are a number of reasons why it threatens to create bad outcomes. The agenda is putting companies on the defensive. From boardrooms, I have seen organisations worry about meeting the demands of environmental and social justice activists, leading to risk aversion in allocating capital. Yet innovation is the most important tool to address many of the challenges of climate change, inequality and social discord. Pursued by $45tn of investments, using the broadest classification, ESG is weighed down by inconsistent, blurry metrics. Investors and lobbyists use different evaluation standards and goals, which focus on varied issues such as CO2 emissions and diversity. Metrics also depend on business models. Without a clear, unified compass, companies that measure themselves against today's standards risk seeming off base once a more consistent regulator-led direction emerges (for example, from worker audits, the COP26 summit and the Paris Club lender nations). ESG is not without cost and the best hope for long-term success lies with business leaders' ability to stay attuned to its impact and unintended consequences. For example, while the case for diversity is incontrovertible, efforts at inclusion should account for the possible casualties of positive discrimination. Furthermore, despite ESG advocates setting a strong and singular direction for governance, organisations have to maintain their operations and value while managing assets and people in a world where cultural and ethical values are far from universal. While laudable, a heightened focus on ethics (such as human rights, environmental concerns, gender and racial parity, data privacy and worker advocacy) places additional stress on global companies. It is often asked if advocates appreciate that ESG is largely viewed from the west's narrow and wealthy economic perspective. To be truly sustainable, ESG demands global solutions to global problems. Proposals need to be scalable, exportable and palatable to emerging countries like India and China, or no effort will truly move the needle. Much of the agenda is too rigid, requires aggressive timelines and lacks the spirit of innovation to achieve longterm societal progress. Stakeholders' interests differ, so ESG solutions must be nuanced, balanced and trade off speed of implementation against the breadth and depth of change. Business leaders are aware of the need for greater focus and prioritisation of ESG. We also understand that deadlines can provide important levers for senior managers to spur their organisations into action. After all, in the face of pressure for a solution to the global pandemic, vaccines were produced in months instead of the usual 10 years. I live at the crossroads of these tensions every day. Raised in Africa, I have lived in energy poverty, and seen how it continues to impede living standards globally. As a board member of a global energy company, I have seen much investment in the energy transition. Yet from my role with a university endowment, I have also been under pressure to divest from energy corporations.    Business leaders must solve ESG concerns in ways that do not set corporations on a path to failure in the long term. They must have the boldness to adopt a flexible, measured and experimental agenda for lasting change. In this sense, they must push back against the politically led narrative that wants imperfect ESG changes at any cost. The writer is a global economist and author of 'How Boards Work', published next month Much of the ESG agenda is too rigid, requires aggressive timelines and lacks a spirit of innovation"

dd9f29c3c03d752e4d77,2021-04-10,Surging green wave creates launch of largest ETF,"Equities Institutional investors have put $1.25bn into a new US fund aimed at identifying the winners of the transition to a low-carbon world, making it the largest exchange traded fund launch ever and underscoring the surging demand for ESG products. The BlackRock US Carbon Transition Readiness fund began trading on Thursday, eclipsing the previous largest ETF listing, the iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders fund, which debuted with $850m in May 2019. A sister fund that invests in non-US companies also launched on Thursday after attracting $475m from investors, also one of the largest new ETFs ever launched. Rather than exclude companies that rate poorly on climate-related metrics, the new ETFs take an underlying equity index the Russell 1000 and MSCI All World ex-US index, respectively and assign portfolio weightings that reflect a carbon transition readiness score. ""Winners and losers will emerge in every sector and industry based on each company's ability to adapt and pivot their strategies and business models,"" said Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock. ""More and more capital is being allocated to sustainable strategies,"" he added. ""These funds will enable investors to understand which companies are transitioning faster than others."" ESG investing aims to tilt money towards companies with strong environmental, social and governance records. Total assets in the sector rose 50 per cent last year to a record $1.7tn, according to Morningstar. Meanwhile, a growing number of governments, companies and asset managers are committed to achieving a net zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050. Carbon transition ETFs are being pitched as a way to encourage the trend and to benefit from it. ""These ETFs represent a way to find managements that will change their company's thinking on climate change,"" said Christopher Ailman, chief investment officer of the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs. The focus of many corporate leaders on industry comparisons will increasingly include their carbon footprint and how it affects their share price, said Ailman. ""What gets measured, gets managed."" Calstrs contributed $650m to the new US ETF and $350m to the global fund. Other investors backing the launches included Temasek, Sura Asset Management, Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company, Profuturo Group, FM Global and RenaissanceRe. The expectation is that companies actively transitioning to the low-carbon economy will outperform long-term, benefiting investors, said Ailman. 'These funds will enable investors to understand which companies are transitioning faster'"
48110d01b2b5d6ec3ffa,2021-04-09,Axa IM places €800m bet on return to the office in Europe,"Financials One of the world's largest asset managers has raised almost €1bn to develop offices in Europe, betting that demand for modern workspaces will bounce back after the pandemic. Axa IM Alts, part of French fund house Axa Investment Managers, has raised €799m to deploy in Europe, with a focus on the UK, Germany and France. Most of the investment will finance offices in big cities, the remainder going towards residential development. ""To launch this kind of development strategy you have to believe there's a future for offices,"" said Ian Chappell, head of development and value added funds at Axa IM Alts. The company is aiming to develop ""high-quality, flexible office space aligned with future working habits"" and to cater to growing demand for offices with low-carbon emissions. The investment will expand a portfolio that includes 22 Bishopsgate, the City of London's largest office block. ""Occupiers are far more concerned about how buildings of the future will meet ESG [environmental, social and governance] requirements ... those will be the building that investors will want to buy first,"" said Chappell. High-spec, city centre offices have tended to attract institutional investors following economic crises because long leases and well-capitalised tenants represent a stable income stream. But there are fears among developers that this time round might be different given that the pandemic has changed the way people work, severing employees' attachments to the workplace. Mat Oakley, head of European commercial property research at real estate company Savills, said: ""I haven't had a discussion with any real estate investor this year that hasn't touched on whether offices are quite as core now [as a result of coronavirus]"". A number of employee surveys conducted over the past year have shown an increased appetite for homeworking even once it is safe to return to work, raising doubts about the viability of some older, less desirable office stock. ""This whole 12 months has really put obsolescence in the spotlight ... Inevitably there will be more pressure to repurpose offices,"" said Chappell. Chappell and Oakley both predict a polarisation in big European cities, with office rents falling in older, less desirable workplaces but staying firm in newer developments. Investors are also willing to bet that modern, high-end offices will remain attractive. According to the global real estate company CBRE, as much as £45bn of global capital is targeting the London office market, the largest volume since the company stared tracking investment in 2012. That represents far more than the amount of available stock, according to James Beckham, managing director of central London investment at CBRE. Demand had built up as lockdowns had sidelined investors, who were now targeting ""best in class"" offices, he added."
b07fdf72bf0a3e157aeb,2021-04-09,Anglo decides to spin off South African coal assets,"Mining Anglo American is to transfer its South African thermal coal assets into a new company, in a move to exit the polluting resource amid growing investor pressure. The demerged company, Thungela, will list on the Johannesburg and London stock exchanges, Anglo said yesterday. Thungela produced 16.5m tonnes of coal last year and has assets worth $1.3bn. ""As the world transitions towards a low-carbon economy, we must continue to act responsibly,"" said Mark Cutifani, Anglo's chief executive. ""Our proposed demerger of what are precious natural resources for South Africa allows us to do exactly that."" Mining companies are under sustained pressure from investors to divest from coal due to its contribution to climate change. Thermal coal is burnt in power stations to generate electricity, a process that is responsible for about 30 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Rio Tinto sold its last coal mine in 2018, while the largest miner, BHP, is also looking to exit its thermal coal business. The demerger will allow Anglo to focus on producing metals that will be in demand during the transition away from fossil fuels towards clean energy such as copper and platinum, analysts said. ""We believe this news is a positive as it is a clear, albeit phased, path to an improved ESG performance for Anglo,"" analysts at Jefferies said. Cutifani said many Anglo investors did not want to support coal so the demerger would give them a choice. Shareholders will each receive one share in Thungela for every 10 Anglo American shares they hold. ""I think there will be plenty of people who will want to buy more of both companies,"" Cutifani added. The move is in contrast to rival Glencore, the largest coal exporter, whose outgoing chief executive Ivan Glasenberg has described divestment as pointless and one that would only lead to more coal production. Anglo said that the demerger would allow Thungela to attract new shareholders and to access capital as an independent company to expand production. But Cutifani defended the decision by saying it would continue to allow highquality thermal coal to be produced, which would displace lower quality coal from the market. The company's main customers are all in Asia, including India, all of whom rely on coal-fired power, he said.    ""You can't just walk away from billions of people across the globe,"" he said. July Ndlovu, chief executive of Thungela, said that the company would pay at least 30 per cent of its free cash flow to investors in the form of dividends. Anglo said that it would provide a $170m capital injection to Thungela and continue to market the company's products to customers for three and a half years. In addition, it would provide ""contingent capital support"" until the end of 2022 if thermal coal prices fell below a certain threshold. The deal will be subject to a vote by shareholders at Anglo's annual meeting in May and needs 75 per cent approval. helen.thomas@ft.com 'It is a clear, albeit phased, path to an improved ESG performance' Jefferies analysts"
83d74d8a732da6874e72,2021-04-09,Borrowers tap ESG demand to sell green debt at premium,"Fixed income. Bubble fears Some investors worry the 'greenium' signals mispriced credit risks Governments and companies raising funds through green debt are benefiting from lower borrowing costs a so-called ""greenium"" in the latest sign of investors' ravenous demand for sustainable assets. The premium in price these deals command highlights the swift growth in the market for debt that is labelled green because it funds spending that is meant to support climate or environmental goals. ""Everything with a green label is basically being bought,"" said Mitch Reznick, head of sustainable fixed income at Federated Hermes. Germany's debut green government bond, which is closely tracked because the country's debt market is considered a regional benchmark, has consistently traded at a premium in price to its conventional counterpart since it was issued last September. The yield on the green Bund is now around 0.05 percentage points lower than its conventional ""twin"", an indication that investors are willing to pay more to hold the environmentally friendly debt. Italy's first sovereign green bond also priced last month at a slight premium compared with typical Italian debt with a similar maturity, analysts said. ""The greenium is now a very well established concept,"" said Philip Brown, global head of public sector and sustainable debt capital markets at Citi. At banks, even ""the most cynical syndicate manager"" arranging bond sales would build a greenium into their pricing expectations, he added. The greenium can be hard to analyse, since issuers do not typically sell green and conventional bonds with the same characteristics at the same time. But in a study of environmental debt issued in the second half of 2020, the Climate Bond Initiative found ""increasing signs"" of the phenomenon. The analysis of 54 corporate and government green bonds, which collectively raised $62.5bn, found the level of demand from investors was greater than for regular equivalents. The CBI also found many of the bonds priced at more favourable borrowing costs than would have been expected for issues with similar maturity. ""The sources of [green bond] demand are increasing more rapidly than the sources of supply,"" making pricing more competitive, said Caroline Harrison, senior research analyst at the CBI. Since pricing typically hinges on an issuer's ability to repay its debts as well as market dynamics such as interest rates, the more favourable terms borrowers receive solely for the green label might represent irrational lending rates, some analysts said.    ""It's not an alarming risk at this point"" but the need to fulfil sustainability mandates could be driving mispricing, said Reznick. ""It's not that credit risk is being ignored; it's not being as precisely priced."" Others worry over whether the green label always lives up to its promises. ""Green bonds are used by borrowers to cash in on lower borrowing costs,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management. ""I don't see what difference that's making at all. I'm not sure that's making the impact that people would like to see."" Instead, it could be more worthwhile to refuse to buy certain issuers' debt or to encourage borrowers into setting tougher standards, he added. Colin Reedie, co-head of global fixed income at Legal & General Investment Management, said imbalances of supply and demand had led to unstable market bubbles in the past, though added that he did not believe the green debt market was approaching bubble territory. Green bonds sold in the primary market tend to price at yields 0.1 to 0.15 percentage points lower than conventional bonds, which was still ""not insignificant"" given the relatively low rate environment, said Reedie. ""Our policy is to treat green bonds no differently from vanilla bonds from the same issuer"" since the default risk is the same regardless of what the money is funding. The possibility of a green bond bubble is concerning from a risk perspective because it would damage the credibility of an important and relatively new market, said Emre Tiftik, director of sustainability research at the Institute of International Finance. But he pointed out that valuations had been stretched across debt markets in general due to enormous volumes of pandemic-related central bank support. ""If there is a [debt] bubble, it's not driven by green bonds,"" he said. Some analysts said they expected the greenium to disappear over time, as supply and demand evened out and responsible investing became the norm, rather than an investment category. Dominic Kini, credit and green bond strategist at HSBC, said sustainable debt was still in a growth phase and the greenium was not ""mispricing"" but a function of supply and demand: a growing group of investors who were required, or wanted, to allocate capital to sustainable activities were competing for a limited pool of assets. In the short term, with investors eyeing the prospect of rising inflation, the greenium could become more pronounced, said Brown at Citi. Bondholders have already started rebalancing portfolios and selling highly rated debt, sending prices lower, as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. But green bonds are likely to be ""stickier"" than vanilla bonds and not among the first assets to be sold, given their relative scarcity, he said. ""We will see this greenium become more structural in the secondary market.""

5013e26af323416a0597,2021-04-05,Investors raise pressure over pandemic issues,"ESG concerns US companies are facing the largest number of demands from investors to address environmental and social concerns in four years, as shareholders press management teams over their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Investors have submitted 484 proposals on environmental or social issues to US companies ahead of this year's annual round of shareholder meetings, to be held in coming weeks. That compared with 446 last year, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, an investor advisory business. Shareholders in the US are able to sponsor their own concerns to put before boards. Although proposals are not binding, companies cannot easily ignore votes that get more than 30 per cent support. Companies complain that proposals are often sponsored by trade unions or gadflies, but in a sign of shifting investor sentiment, BlackRock, one of the world's largest fund managers, said last year that it would consider supporting more proposals this year. ""The shift from just disclosure to accountability generally, in terms of shareholder engagement and proposals is increasing and accelerating,"" said Peter Reali, a senior director at asset manager Nuveen. ""Part of what is driving that acceleration are some of these Covid-related issues."" Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson are facing calls from shareholders for greater disclosure on pricing of Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics. The companies received government aid to develop treatments but had not specified how they will price their medications, the shareholder petitions said. Both companies have meetings on April 22. Charging a high price for Covid-19 medication ""could damage Pfizer's reputation and create a regulatory risk for the company"", said Trinity Health, which filed the petition. Johnson & Johnson has said its not-for-profit pricing will last throughout the pandemic. Pfizer did not provide a comment. Shareholders are also displeased with companies' efforts to protect their workers from Covid-19. New York City's pension funds have filed a petition calling on Amazon to be more transparent about its efforts to mitigate health risks from coronavirus. Amazon, which has not yet scheduled its meeting, said it invested more than $10bn last year to protect workers, among other things. Some investors have already voted this year for proposals when they felt companies' transparency over coronavirus efforts was lacking. BlackRock and Vanguard were among shareholders that successfully pushed through a proposal asking the meat producer Tyson Foods for greater disclosure on human rights after concerns about workers. Investors are also scrutinising executive bonuses awarded during the pandemic. Wynn Resorts, Darden and Schlumberger were among the companies that rewrote bonus plans to make it easier for managers to make their targets."
3bda0c5dea2e31ff7a3d,2021-04-05,Stakeholder capitalism must find ways to hold management to account,"A t the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic many assumed that the surge of interest in stakeholder capitalism would go into reverse. And, for pandemic-hit companies with their backs to the wall, the interests of customers, employees, suppliers and society were bound to be trampled in the sauve qui peut bid for survival. Yet the much-discussed call by Black-Rock's Larry Fink for companies to link corporate purpose to all their stakeholders looks with hindsight to have been politically acute. While many question whether this commitment is more than rhetorical, there can be no doubt that big business and institutional investors are under increasing pressure on this issue, with US president Joe Biden having vowed last July to ""put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism"". And the British institutions that shunned the Deliveroo flotation last week were clearly serious in their objections to its treatment of workers and dual-voting structure. The pressure is not all one way witness the ousting of the chief executive of French food group Danone. Yet Milton Friedman's doctrine that the only purpose of the corporation is to make money for its shareholders sits uneasily with current concerns not just about coronavirus but climate change, wage stagnation, inequality and diversity. More fundamentally, the pandemic has shown that a shareholder primacy model of capitalism that emerged in the 19th century is wholly inappropriate for 21st-century conditions. That model reflected the belief that the owner, the shareholder, was the ultimate risktaker, entitled to the residual profits of the company when all other stakeholder claims had been satisfied. To take today's most obvious examples, workers and patients in privately owned care homes are at infinitely greater risk than outside shareholders in those homes. Many skilled workers who have been fired during the pandemic have lost not only their jobs but human capital skills that were specific to the firm that employed them. At the same time corporate bankruptcy is far more dangerous for suppliers than for institutional asset owners who spread risk across large, diversified portfolios. In anglophone economies, the commitment to a short-term, narrowly financial definition of shareholder value has helped undermine corporate resilience by encouraging excessive dividends and share buybacks that weaken balance sheets. Yet a shift to a stakeholder model raises difficult questions about how stakeholders can hold management to account. Existing stakeholder models incorporate worker-directors. This gives priority to a single stakeholder interest that may conflict with those of other stakeholders. There is a risk that widening the board's responsibility will reduce management accountability. The UK provides an interesting case study. Section 172 of the 2006 Companies Act requires directors to promote a company's success while having regard to the likely long-term consequences of any decision, the interests of employees, the need to foster business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and the impact of the company's operations on the environment. (Disclosure: I was on the steering group of the UK Company Law Review which provided the blueprint for the 2006 Act.) This has proved ineffectual. First, because long termism has been subverted by a short-termist boardroom bonus culture. Meanwhile capital market pressures and a hostile takeover discipline ensure that short-term performance trumps stakeholder responsibility, with a general stakeholder reluctance to seek remedies in court.    For stakeholder capitalism to work, efforts to extend the time horizons of incentive schemes must be supplemented by metrics relating to the environmental, social and governance agenda. Shareholders should be given greater power to restrain takeover activity, which does not always deliver value. Existing initiatives to improve reporting on human capital, employee safety and sustainability should be strengthened so that shareholders can engage more effectively with investee companies on ESG issues. But there is a limit to what boards and shareholders alone can do. Leo Strine, former chief justice of the Delaware supreme court, supports modernising the 1930s New Deal for a 21st century economy to protect key stakeholders through measures such as curbs on the gig economy, enhanced consumer protection, stronger antitrust law and carbon taxes. With a Biden presidency and a rapidly changing political climate in the rich world, that may now be within the range of the possible. john.plender@ft.com A short-term, narrowly financial definition of shareholder value has undermined resilience"
3ed4715596a4488a67a2,2021-04-03,Fossil fuel investors leave clean peers green with envy,"We have a consensus that there has to be a transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And particularly with the departure of the Trump administration, we largely agree on the requirement to shift from fossil fuel. So why have fossil fuel equities prices, broadly, been rising since the beginning of the year, and why are many clean energy equities performing weakly, or even declining in price? Let's take a few examples. The ICLN i-Shares Global Clean Energy ETF is down 14 per cent in 2021. TAN, Invesco's solar ETF, has fallen 10.7 per cent in the same period. On the other side, XLE, an ETF representing major oil companies, has risen 29.4 per cent. As for individual stocks, we have Orsted, the Danish wind energy developer, down 24 per cent. Vestas Wind Systems, which designs and makes wind turbine systems, has fallen 15.7 per cent. Vestas' competitor Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is down 0.3 per cent this year. On the other side of the virtue divide we have the US fracking-oriented exploration and production companies. Consider EOG Resources. It has an Aminus bond rating and a reputation for having one of the most skilful E&P management groups. Its shares have risen 45.4 per cent. Or consider Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation of Houston. It has concentrated on drilling the gasrich Marcellus Basin and has seen its shares rise 15.4 per cent. Of all the oil majors, ExxonMobil might be considered the least likely to have put solar panels or wind turbines in green meadows on the cover of the annual report. And yes, its share price is up 35.4 per cent this year. This is all so strange. BlackRock just wrote to its clients about ""Net Zero, a fiduciary approach"". It said that ""In 2020 we completed our goal of having 100 per cent of our active and advisory portfolios ESG-integrated."" If that really represents ""best practices"" for investment managers, why are previous high returns for clean energy companies not being continued in 2021? Reasons might include overcrowded auctions for clean energy development rights and green-power contracts, rising interest rates and Opec oil supply cuts. I believe all of those conditions are reflected in the share prices. There has been a lot of capital thrown at clean energy in recent years, at least relative to portfolio investors' interest in fossil fuels. This was reflected in the recent auction for seabed sites for offshore wind by the UK's Crown Estates. These went for 10 to 20 times the prices paid at the last such auction in 2010. As the investment company Bernstein wrote in March, the results are ""feeding already existing market worries about overheating competition in offshore wind and pressures on returns"". And that is before the wind projects are built. The prices and terms for clean energy generation are becoming less favourable as more developers bid against each other for power offtake contracts. In places such as California, consumers' rooftop solar power has sharply cut the peak load commercial developers (and their lenders) were counting on to pay the bills. Meanwhile, the remaining shale E&P companies no longer spend every dollar of earned or borrowed cash to drill more wells. Opec is still producing oil below its collective capacity.    The green vs fossil reversal of fortune might not last. Or the political economy of energy would have to change much more dramatically than we have seen so far. john.dizard@ft.com Exxon might be considered least likely to put solar panels on the cover of its report. And yes, its shares are up 35.4%"
52cef036ea9662b99ef3,2021-04-03,Retail investors shaken after Deliveroo's downhill ride,"Technology. Flotations IPO shines light on risks that face individual traders when buying institutional products It was touted as an opportunity for retail investors in the red-hot London IPO market, but Deliveroo failed to deliver. Individual investors who picked up shares in the food delivery service had their fingers burnt, locked in to their holdings as shares fell almost a third on Wednesday, the opening day. More than 70,000 Deliveroo customers participated in the £50m retail raise using PrimaryBid, the London Stock Exchange-backed group that provides an IPO platform for individual traders. This made Deliveroo the biggest UK company to involve retail investors in its fundraising since Royal Mail in 2013. But rather than serving as an advertisement for the democratisation of the London market, by 9am on Wednesday, brokers had begun to worry that Deliveroo would spook these investors and risk shutting down the IPO pipeline entirely. ""We were told the institutional book was four or five times covered,"" said a person close to the process. ""I really hope that this doesn't shut down the IPO market. It's a big risk, as pricing feels a long way off what was promised."" The IPO, already branded one of the worst by some bankers, comes as brokers, companies and officials push to make it easier for retail investors to take part in equity issues. But as Richard Wilson, chief executive of Interactive Investor, said: ""Just because you're a Deliveroo customer and bought a pizza doesn't necessarily make you a suitable shareholder."" The IPO market has long been dominated by institutional funds and large investment banks, creating what critics have called a cosy network with little incentive to bother with retail investors. Retail investing has opened up in the US, but the UK has lagged behind. Only 13 per cent of equities in the UK are owned by retail investors, compared with the majority in the US and in parts of Europe. Fewer than a third of the 333 fundraisings and 38 UK IPOs in 2020 included a retail offering, said Peel Hunt, the broker, with companies such as Foxtons criticised for cutting such investors out. The UK investment industry is seeking to catch up after retail traders were locked out of much of the pandemic fundraisings of 2020. More groups are willing to include retail in their IPO plans, because it taps into their customer offer, makes good PR or ticks ESG boxes. PensionBee, for example, helped customers take part in its £350m IPO this month. Parsley Box included retail investors in its March flotation. Peel Hunt has created a platform for brokers and wealth managers to place shares with customers that backed nine IPOs last year. ""It's obviously a very attractive time to be given that sort of    opportunity, especially when everyone is looking for growth opportunities,"" said Romina Savova, founder of PensionBee. The government's review of the listing regime suggested allowing more retail investors to participate in capital raisings without needing a prospectus. But the Deliveroo IPO has shone a light on the risks that face retail traders when buying institutional products. The average pop on the first day of dealing has been 12 per cent, according to analysis of IPOs since 2018 by AJ Bell, the stockbroker. But groups that went public underperformed industry benchmarks by an average of 2 per cent a year, according to research by Dimensional, the financial research firm, looking at more than 6,000 IPOs from 1991 to 2018. IPO pricing is notoriously opaque, and retail investors can struggle to ascertain what kind of discount they really get in a direct offer. ""IPOs should be targeted at investors who understand the risks,"" said Nigel Morris of Solid Solutions, a retail share offer provider. ""If we get investors who don't understand, it is going to damage the whole idea of retail IPOs."" Wilson described retail investors as ""second-class citizens"" in comparison to institutions. Retail offers attached to many IPOs were ""marketing"". More protection was needed as the barriers to entry for retail investors dropped through low-cost share dealing and easy-to-use platforms. Anand Sambasivan, co-founder of PrimaryBid, said: ""We're talking about ownership in some of the most important and biggest companies in the world, and the engagement with the individual investor is basically zero."" Many investors are still hoping for a return from Deliveroo. Christian Lette, chief digital officer at Wavemaker UK, a media group, bought £1,000 of shares, the full allocation, which was worth £700 after just a few hours. He was ""not fantastically happy"" but felt he was ""putting in a small amount and seeing it as a long-term investment"". James Deal, co-founder of Primary-Bid, said: ""Stocks go up and down. If Deliveroo shares were up 20 per cent today, we'd all be having a very difficult conversation if retail hadn't been allowed to participate.""

c4f6f18230536e84fb1c,2021-04-03,UK report on race is a masterclass in gaslighting,"As a child of Caribbean parents, who studied at Oxford and now has her own consultancy practice, I'm fully aware that the government's Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities could hold me up as evidence of the conclusion it reached this week that UK society is no longer institutionally racist. At least 14 per cent of Britons people who are typically under-represented and marginalised in the UK could also raise a glass in celebration. And we would, if it were true. Instead, the report has caused outrage among ethnically diverse communities. The day after its publication, even the government's adviser on racism resigned. One of its few positive outcomes is the recommendation that the government end its use of the acronym ""BAME"". The term masks the complex ways that racism affects people to such a degree that it is meaningless. Its abolition is welcome: hopefully the media will follow suit and join the many busi-nesses that use more accurate terms to reflect cultural distinctiveness. That, though, is where the report's usefulness ends. The rest of the findings are a masterclass in gaslighting. It cites the impact of social income, geography, and other aspects of lived experience. But it dismisses the detrimental impact of how these interact with ethnicity to result in significantly poorer outcomes for social mobility, career opportunity, earnings, health and legal redress. To take my own experience: I have a great education and a great career. But that doesn't help me when I am being treated by a GP who dismisses my medical concerns, or when the police stop me yet again. Nor does a great education stop a woman of Caribbean heritage from being more likely to die in childbirth than her white friends, or a man with African heritage from having a higher likelihood of being arrested. The government has also used data from eight of its own reports that provide evidence of racial inequity. Yet, via inventive interpretation of statistics, it then denies the institutional racism that is endemic in almost every corner of society. The report's authors use exceptions to shape their conclusions. They cite people from ethnically diverse back-grounds who ""make it"" as evidence that they didn't face disproportionate disadvantage on their way to success. Yet the report then fails to acknowledge that corporate boards and leaders in the public and private sectors don't reflect the UK's ethnically diverse demographic. The report also cites educational outcomes at GCSE level as evidence that the UK is no longer racist. But it then ignores the disparity in earnings among ethnically diverse people, and disregards research from Aberdeen University that shows white people have better earning and social mobility outcomes irrespective of qualification. It also ignores the TUC report (based on the government's own data) showing that ethnically diverse people have been disproportionately affected by redundancies during the pandemic. One of the commission's most insidious recommendations surrounds how organisations should move training against prejudice from those who might practice racism, and on to those who experience it instead. This is the ultimate gaslight: we're not the problem, it's you the advice suggests that what's at fault is the communication and presentation skills of ethnically diverse workers. This is akin to suggesting that workplaces don't need to create an inclusive welcome or to ensure equity for all their staff; ethnically diverse people just need to have yet more training.    The government is behind current thinking: most workplaces moved away from unconscious bias training years ago, realising that telling people they're prejudiced is a long way from taking useful action. Progressive organisations are instead embedding anti-racism into their ESG policies and metrics. This report seriously misinterprets the British mood. The pandemic has made everyone acutely aware of social inequities, and of our collective responsibility to rebuild and re-set society in better ways. It's a wonderful opportunity for change. But that can't happen if we're in denial. The writer is director of Inc Arts, which promotes diversity in the creative sector I have a great education and a great career.

5eaf889802c18eb3ee46,2021-04-03,English parks gave better investor advice than Goldman,"O ver the past year you will have heard a lot about what is driving stock markets. You've been told that environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, matters more than anything; ""better"" companies provide better returns. You've probably also been told that the pandemic has changed the dynamics of economies entirely. It's driven relentless digitisation, and changed the way we live and work for good. No one will ever go back to the office full time, shop again at physical retailers, or cook for themselves again. It's home delivery, forever. Much of this may be true. But listening to a lot of this guff, it feels as though we have reached a point in the market cycle where everyone is preferring stories to reality. Take food delivery firm Deliveroo, which listed on the UK stock exchange this week. It didn't go very well: the shares closed down 26 per cent on their first day of trading. A lot people have a lot to say about this. Some reckon it was caused by Deliveroo's dual share structure: chief executive Will Shu holds shares with 20 times the voting power of others. Some reckon it was about regulatory concerns: what if the company's gig-working riders end up costing as much as employees? Others say it was about a shift in investor perceptions. As vaccines get to work and lockdowns are eased, the idea we are completely changing the way we live and consume is starting to fray. Much of this is clever nonsense. It may seem ridiculous to say so, but the slide in Deliveroo's share price was not solely about fund managers' new passion for ESG or any of these other things. It was about the share price. The company's £7.6bn valuation, the highest for a British initial public offering since Glencore's 2011 listing, was simply too much to ask for a lossmaking company that operates in a market with few barriers to entry. Deliveroo may be a brilliant, innovative and fast-growing business that will be worth £7.6bn one day just not this week. Until a couple of months ago this might not have mattered. Super low bond yields, which make the lack of income from lossmaking companies easier to bear, made many investors value a company's putative success in the future more than actual corporate success today. Even at the start of the pandemic, this valuation gap between growth stocks and value stocks was at a record high. For most of 2020, it got bigger. In certain fast-growing sectors, company fundamentals and stock prices simply stopped mattering. So why did Deliveroo's valuation suddenly matter? One answer is that rising bond yields are now making the market's more crazed sectors come to their senses. In the last quarter alone, the yield on 10-year US Treasuries has almost doubled to 1.7 per cent. With inflation looking likely, yields may well keep rising from here. Some may look at this, see Deliveroo as a canary in the coal mine, and rush to sell everything. But just as we must be careful not to extrapolate recent food delivery trends far into the future, we need to be careful not to rely too much on what recently rising bond yields means for markets. It is pretty easy to find periods when rising bond yields have not translated into falling equity prices. Just look at what happened in the 1920s and 1960s, says Calderwood Capital's Dylan Grice. In fact, if you examine how equity prices and yields have changed over the long term, it's hard to find much of a relationship between them at all. Even in really nasty bond routs, equities as a whole don't always do badly. What    matters more is less where bond yields are heading than where equity prices are starting from. Put another way, as bond yields rise any overpriced assets, such as growth stocks, may well suffer. But anything that is both fairly priced and exposed to economic reopening will not. Anyone wondering how to invest over the next year should therefore look at what happened in English parks this week. On Monday, two days before the Deliveroo flop, a relaxation of lockdown regulations allowed six people to meet outside as they did. Anyone seeing those crowds would have sensibly dumped the idea of buying anything involving home delivery and instead rushed to buy assets linked to travel, energy, cars, retail or commodities. It's a lesson for the busy bankers at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, who mispriced the Deliveroo deal and should have lifted their heads from their spreadsheets to check out the real world instead. The shift to value from growth is already under way: one classic value index, the FTSE 100, is up 21 per cent since the end of October but should have further to go. There is one more important thing investors should think about. Grice's analysis may show an ambiguous relationship between bond yields and stock prices. But it does show one clear connection: rising bond yields tend to coincide with rising volatility. So one thing you can be fairly sure about the market over the next few years: it will scare you.

dd2aeb53eb4c8da482d5,2021-04-01,China forces brands to make a cotton choice,"Action against H&M and Nike shows intolerance of Xinjiang scrutiny The disappearance of Hennes & Mauritz, one of the world's largest clothing retailers, from ecommerce and ridehailing apps in China last week marks an escalation in the diplomatic battle over cotton from Xinjiang. China has shown that it will not just encourage local consumer boycotts of global brands that reject Xinjiang cotton, but will impose them. China is enraged by governments and civil society groups drawing attention to its human rights abuses against more than 1m Uyghurs and minorities in Xinjiang. It is acting aggressively against textile and fashion companies that publicly eliminate sourcing from Xinjiang, which provides about 20 per cent of the world's cotton. Companies such as H&M and Nike have been caught awkwardly between political pressure from the US and Europe, and Chinese denunciation of ""malicious lies"" about the situation in Xinjiang. Until now, they have kept on growing retail operations in China while diversifying their supply chains. As China makes this balancing act harder, they will be forced to take a clearer stance. Tensions over Xinjiang have prompted sanctions from the EU, UK, US and Canada, and retaliation from China. Meanwhile, companies under scrutiny over standards of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) have tried to curb supply chain abuses, including forced labour. China has now signalled that it will not tolerate such insubordination. China is in a powerful position, given the growing importance of its consumer market to global brands and retailers Nike's sales in greater China in the quarter to February outstripped those in North America. It has a considerable lever to pull against what CCTV, the broadcaster, last week called ""unruly companies"" with ""no basic business ethics"" that seek to ""earn a huge profit in China"". For a long time, the complexity and lack of transparency in global supply chains permitted fashion brands and retailers to avoid scrutiny. It was almost impossible to tell where the fabric in most clothing came from and the conditions it had been produced under. Technology such as DNA tracing that allows products to be tracked along their route has changed that. The way that brands behave around the world has also become more transparent, thanks to the internet. It is impossible to address consumers and politicians in one country without those in others also finding out. Last week's accusation by China's Communist Youth League that H&M had ""boycotted"" Xinjiang cotton was based on a company statement from last year. Such transparency has helped to raise supply chain standards during the past two decades, but is now being exploited by China. Companies that do not bow to its insistence that Xinjiang is ""snow white"" face a consumer boycott by fiat, while Chinese competitors are allowed to prosper. China no doubt wants global brands to exert pressure on western governments to back down. The immediate predicament may not be as stark as it seems: state media campaigns against offending global brands have faded in the past, and China will not want to lose H&M and Nike entirely. H&M may be able to regain visibility for its Chinese outlets with conciliatory noises.    But the outlook is clear: China runs its economy as it wishes and will not tolerate attention being drawn to human rights infringements. It is forcing brands into choosing between social responsibility and sales to one of the world's biggest consumer markets. The silent treatment it has given to H&M is only the start of that test."
ac19a95b20642f30f699,2021-03-29,Fortress LNG deal raises clean energy yellow card,"Oil & gas Financier Wes Edens, a part-owner of Aston Villa football club, has raised the hackles of green investors after borrowing $1.5bn to fund his gas infrastructure group's takeover of another fossil fuel operation that it says will help speed up the world's transition to clean energy. The funds will in part finance the acquisition by Edens' New Fortress Energy of Golar LNG Partners at a $1.9bn enterprise value, which the company says will add ships to transport gas as part of a bigger deal to expand into Brazil. The LNG industry offers itself as an alternative to other fossil fuels, on the basis that gas emits less carbon dioxide than oil or coal in combustion. Advocates say that it offers a bridge while renewable energy scales up, particularly in countries otherwise dependent on coal and oil. However, natural gas is mainly made up of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps more heat in the atmosphere than a molecule of carbon dioxide and contributes to global warming. Gas production, storage and transport are prone to methane leakage. ""While methane tends to receive less attention than CO2, reducing methane emissions will be critical to avoid the worst effects of climate change,"" the International Energy Agency said in its 2020 gas report. Charles Portier, a portfolio manager at Mirova, a climate focused investment management subsidiary of Natixis, said: ""We don't think that natural gas is the best friend for the transition. It's the coal of tomorrow. Natural gas is a fossil fuel ... Natural gas is dangerous."" While the New Fortress fundraising is not classed as a green or sustainable bond a designation that comes with reporting requirements to ensure the money is spent on green or sustainable projects the company highlighted its environmental benefits when it marketed the deal to investors. New Fortress says it eventually aims to replace fossil fuels with, ""affordable zero-emissions hydrogen"" despite its core assets being in natural gas. Among investors that have been drawn into previous New Fortress bond issues is BlackRock's $450m global high yield ESG and credit screened fund, which takes into account companies' effect on the environment. It prohibits investment in coal companies but does not mention natural gas and invested in the New Fortress's bond issue last year. ""I don't think that you could say [LNG] is green,"" said Helen Wiggs, head of corporate climate at responsible investing group ShareAction. ""Coal to clean works faster, and causes less environmental damage along the way, and stops unnecessary investment in [fossil fuel] infrastructure."" Even investors without a strict ESG mandate said New Fortress had benefited from the green drive. ""They are trying to play the green idea,"" said one bond fund manager. ""It's smart."" 'We don't think that natural gas is the best friend for the transition. It's the coal of tomorrow'"

She also correctly draws attention to the fact that the ""planet"" receives more corporate reporting attention than ""people"", and that the language around ""social"" often amounts to corporate fluff, at best. However, to focus social reporting solely on staff, as she suggests, is a mistake. Society, supply chains and security also form part of the ""S"". In the world of energy, we see a risk that locally clean, net-zero energy solutions might still lead to globally dirty and socially unfair outcomes. We see wealthy world conversations about the type of electricity 10 per cent of society may prefer, while 800m on the planet are without any access to electricity whatsoever. There remain significant societal questions about who pays for the full costs, and benefits, of global energy transition. Energy justice across the planet is far from secured, and energy affordability is a growing issue in developed and developing countries.

9856d67ce82960847eb0,2021-03-26,Legal threats make for rough ride at Deliveroo,"Technology. Gig economy Investors fear costs burden as self-employed riders model comes under growing pressure When the skies darken over London, Joe brightens up. After two-and-a-half years biking meals round the capital for Deliveroo, he knows that bad weather means better pay. Joe said ""working life"" meant ""you're always looking at the weather"", because when it rained, customers were more likely to order takeaway and casual couriers were less likely to go out. While Deliveroo touts flexibility as an advantage, for full-time couriers such as Joe, ""you have to work when it's busy"". That had become harder with Deliveroo's casual workforce doubling over the past year, he said. ""Over-hiring is the critical issue for riders and our fees. That has got way worse for us since the pandemic."" The surge in food delivery has thrown a spotlight on the employment practices of companies whose business model depends on having armies of workers at hand to meet fluctuating demand, with no obligations to guarantee their pay, hours or even their personal safety. A study of rider earnings published yesterday has found that on an hourly basis, a third of drivers in the UK are paid less than the minimum wage. Deliveroo, which is targeting a market capitalisation of up to £8.8bn in this month's initial public offering in London, is under increasing pressure to justify its model of using self-employed riders, following Uber's decision to cede to a Supreme Court ruling and class its UK drivers though not its food couriers as workers with entitlement to the minimum wage and other benefits. Deliveroo faces legal challenges in at least five of its main markets over the status of its riders. Last year it almost quadrupled the provision it made for fines and other costs related to legal proceedings, to £112.2m. A large portion of that relates to Italy, where it is threatened with criminal prosecution after the Italian government found Deliveroo should have engaged its riders on a ""quasi-employee basis"". The company has said it will continue to defend its position that riders are independent contractors, but highlighted to investors the risk that it might not succeed. If it were forced to change its model, it could incur ""significant additional expense"" or exit some markets. David Cumming, head of UK equities at asset manager Aviva Investors, told BBC Radio 4 that a ""combination of investment risk and social issues"" made him reluctant to invest in Deliveroo. Others have echoed this concern. Andrew Millington, head of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""We will not be taking part in the Deliveroo IPO, as we are concerned about the sustainability of the business model, including but not limited to its employment practices.""    An equity investor at another asset manager said they were ""not very keen"" on buying Deliveroo shares next week, in part because of the regulatory burden. ""Given it's such a low-margin business, the extra costs have the potential to destroy profitability."" Tom Powdrill, head of stewardship at PIRC, a shareholder advisory group, said that for the growing number of investors prioritising environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, Deliveroo ""has question marks on both the S and the G"". Deliveroo said: ""There has been a strong investor interest in our planned IPO, and we are already backed by some of the most respected global tech investors."" Deliveroo's prospectus maintains that in the UK, by far its largest market by sales, the ""self-employed status of our riders has been confirmed in multiple court rulings"". But even since Deliveroo began its IPO process this month, it has had to update its filings to warn prospective investors of new legal threats in Spain that could reclassify delivery workers as employees and force it to share details of its algorithms. Pay is one of the biggest sources of contention. Deliveroo says its riders earn more than £10 an hour on average for the time they spend assigned to orders and an average of £13 in peak times. But an investigation led by the Bureau for Investigative Journalism, which analysed 2,669 invoices from 318 riders between April 2020 and March 2021, suggests otherwise. It found that more than half of the riders earned less than Deliveroo claims. For every hour logged into the Deliveroo app, a third earned less than £8.72, the main adult rate of the national minimum wage. Deliveroo hit at what it called ""unverifiable, misleading claims"", based on data gathered from less than 1 per cent of its UK riders. It said hourly rates were not a ""meaningful reflection"" of how riders were paid, because they could accept jobs from multiple apps at the same time. Based on the time between accepting an order and dropping it off, Deliveroo said average earnings were more than the national minimum wage. Riders received an average of £4-£5 per order and average delivery fees had risen year on year. Riders say all the delivery apps have pros and cons. But one common gripe with Deliveroo is that it offers a fixed fare when riders accept an order, with no adjustment if they are held up at a restaurant which often happens or by traffic delays. Some investors argue that upending the gig economy employment model is in the long-term business interests of Deliveroo and its rivals. Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and former Uber investor, believes that employing riders ""may actually be the better play"". That way, they could be prevented from working for rivals and avoid the costly competition to recruiting new workers, he suggested. ""I sold all my Uber shares as soon as I could, and I personally will not invest in Deliveroo when it goes public,"" Tusk said. ""I would reconsider all that if I thought they had a way to lock in the dominant position in the marketplace."" On the matter of ESG issues, there were 'question marks on both the S and the G'"
da33f3dd73af6426469b,2021-03-25,Investors pump record $43bn into niche ETFs in first two months of year,"Fixed income Ark ETFs have led a broader stampede into thematic exchange traded funds, in which assets under management rose to a record $394bn globally by the end of February. Data gathered by ETFGI show that these more narrowly invested ETFs, which allow investors to choose products that focus on anything from innovation to ageing populations and renewable energy, drew net inflows of $42.6bn in the first two months of this year. This was more than three times the $13.3bn for the same period last year and a significant slice of the $222.5bn invested in ETFs as a whole during this period. The Ark suite of ETFs comprised the top five thematic ETFs by net new assets, collectively gathering $13.5bn by the end of February. However, Ark Innovation, the most popular of all, illustrates some of the risks associated with expressing such narrow investment views. After rewarding investors with meteoric returns of 153 per cent in 2020, and gains of more than 10 per cent in January, the fund racked up losses in February. ""The space is definitely a little hot, so caution should be heeded. One shouldn't invest blindly based on the headline theme,"" said Mark Perchtold, co-founder of Omba Advisory and Investments, an asset and wealth manager. ""People are shooting from the hip. They just read about something and they want to buy it,"" he added. Omba is planning to launch an Irish-domiciled Ucits mutual fund that will invest in a portfolio of thematics, but Perchtold said that the underlying holdings would be scrutinised to assess valuation, risk and to avoid overexposure to companies such as Tesla that might be categorised under a number of themes. Deborah Fuhr, founder of ETFGI, said that the data showed that thematics had become the most popular niche ETF strategy. In the same two months smart beta ETFs, which invest according to factors such as value and momentum, attracted only $29bn, actively managed ETFs $34bn and ETFs that invest according to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles $41bn, though there is an overlap between the categories. Fuhr said that the surge in interest was coming from wealthy investors as well as the retail market. ""Some of them have put money aside and they're watching the news and investing on it,"" she said.    Fuhr added that the real shift in investor behaviour was coming from investors who were using the products as they might have invested in single company stocks in the past: to express their personal views on what they thought were long-term trends. Bill Davis, managing director of Stance Capital, an ESG ETF specialist, said that the growing maturity of the ESG market was driving thematic interest. 'People are shooting from the hip. They just read about something and they want to buy it'"
58d3ef904bf495fd483a,2021-03-25,Spirited boutique led call to arms against Danone boss,"Financials. Faber fight Little-known Bluebell owns less than €20m of target but became campaign's public face On January 18, a letter from an activist calling for replacement of Danone chief Emmanuel Faber was leaked to a magazine. It proved to be a call to arms among the group's biggest shareholders, who began contacting London-based Bluebell Capital to learn more. ""If you take the largest investors in the shareholder register, we've been called by everyone,"" said Bluebell cofounder Marco Taricco. But he said the firm was not the source of the leak: ""The vast majority was highly critical and dissatisfied with Mr Faber's performance."" The episode turned the spotlight on the hedge fund boutique that is less than two years old. The group owns less than €20m of Danone, which has a market cap of €41bn, and has a fraction of the firepower of such US activists as $40bn group Elliott and $15.5bn Third Point. Nevertheless, Bluebell quickly became the public face of a campaign at Danone that led to Faber's ouster. The activist, set up by former Goldman Sachs bankers, had verbalised growing and multiyear frustration over performance at the group. It marked the latest example of how Taricco and co-founder Giuseppe Bivona have taken on big companies such as Monte dei Paschi di Siena, GAM, and Solvay, drumming up support for its campaigns from fellow shareholders. In the case of Danone, it reflected the view of many when it called to replace Faber and split the roles of chair and chief executive. Bluebell's campaign was soon followed by a separate push by US-based fund Artisan. Amid the revolts, initially Danone pushed to look for a new CEO but keep Faber as chair. This was too little to satisfy activists but enough to reassure Bluebell the balance was shifting. Two weeks later Faber was out completely. Faber's eviction was reminiscent of the years before the financial crisis when activists with tiny stakes could create fear. Bluebell's rivals see the part it played in it as a vital win. ""They were particularly effective in building a consensus among fellow shareholders who may have been nervous"" of being seen to criticise Faber's ethical credentials, said one hedge fund activist. The campaign at Danone, which over the past decade has found itself in the crosshairs of activists such as Nelson Peltz and Corvex, comes after a tricky period for the strategy. Many activists have been wary of being seen to attack companies struggling in the pandemic. There are signs of an uptick in activity after some funds used last year's sell-off as a chance to increase stakes in targets. With equity markets having rebounded so strongly over the past year, activists are again putting pressure on companies, particularly over how to use cash reserves built up during the pandemic. There were 57 new campaigns launched in the fourth quarter, up 128 per cent on the third quarter, according to Lazard. The ""Covid pause is over"" for activists, the investment bank said.    Bluebell began life as an advisory firm. It was set up in 2014 by Taricco and Bivona, who met at Columbia business school. They sold stock ideas to activists such as Paul Singer's Elliott and Jana. It included working with Elliott in Ansaldo and with Jana at Tiffany. The pair would back ideas with their money alongside the partner's investment, while negotiating profit-sharing. Taricco said: ""What matters is the quality of the suggestion you put forward. Our strategy lends itself well to gathering investor support."" In 2019 they set up Bluebell Capital Partners with Francesco Trapani, the former head of Bulgari, and launched the hedge fund in November that year. Today, as Bluebell Capital, the €70m asset base mainly comprises the founders' money and that of friends and family. It has continued its strategy of teaming up with bigger operators to make its voice heard in activist situations. This was shown at Monte dei Paschi di Siena. It argued that the lender, which had received a state bailout and become a political issue, was hiding derivative transactions. Working with York and Alken, the campaign attracted support from the Five Star Movement. In 2019, 13 former bankers from Monte dei Paschi, Deutsche and Nomura were sentenced to jail for helping the bank hide hundreds of millions of euros of losses using derivatives, and last year former chair Alessandro Profumo was also sentenced to jail. Bluebell runs just 11 positions. It focuses on medium and large groups rather than small-caps where there is more chance a firm will have a dominant and potentially less amenable shareholder. It has built a stake of undisclosed size in UniCredit, where it opposes appointment of chair-designate Pier Carlo Padoan, ex-finance minister. Bluebell says Padoan is not independent because of his role in the bailout of Monte dei Paschi, a possible takeover target for UniCredit. Taricco said: ""We're firmly opposed to this acquisition. There's a long list of issues"" at Monte dei Paschi. ""It's a total disaster."" Another target, Solvay, reflects Bluebell's commitment to undertake one campaign a year at a company where it buys one share and advocates better ESG conduct. Bluebell still sometimes looks to work with bigger funds, as in a private equity co-investment, taking a fee for selling the activism idea. Taricco said his firm preferred a lowprofile, constructive approach, ""but if it's made public, we don't shy away from being vocal"". Faber was one of the most vocal champions of ESG. Taricco said that while he supported Faber's focus, the issue was governance and performance. ""It can't come at the expense of shareholder returns. The first duty of a public company is to remunerate shareholders."" Taricco said he had rarely found companies to be defensive when ideas were presented to them. Even when that meant removing an executive, the move was always driven by financial analysis. ""There's never anything personal in what we do.""

7067ba398361f370e6e5,2021-03-24,Banks' $750bn for fossil fuels conflicts with green pledges,"BNP financing biggest in Europe ? Net-zero plans 'dangerously weak' Global banks provided $750bn in financing to coal, oil and gas companies last year even though many pledged to back the Paris climate accord and cut their funding for fossil fuels, research by an activist group shows. BNP Paribas stood out for the largest absolute increase in funding to fossil fuel companies, with a 41 per cent annual rise to $41bn, according to latest analysis by the Rainforest Action Network. The French lender has positioned itself as a leader in green finance and signed a UN-backed commitment to ""align its portfolio"" to keep global warming below 2C. It has provided a total of $121bn since the Paris accord. The bank declined to comment but responded in a letter to authors of the RAN report that its funding for oil and gas companies grew less significantly than its funding to other sectors. US banks continue to be the largest financiers of fossil fuel groups. JPMorgan Chase was again the biggest, with $317bn of funding through lending and underwriting since 2016. However, it reduced the amount of new financing by 20 per cent to $51bn in 2020. Citigroup provided $48bn in 2020, down from $53bn the previous year, for a total of $238bn in financing since 2016. Wells Fargo cut its fossil fuel financing the most in 2020, reporting a 42 per cent drop to issue $26bn, but that was not primarily because of its climate policies. The bank, which is the largest backer of the US fracking industry and has provided a total of $223bn in finance since 2016, chalked up the decline to the oil price plunge, which led to ""reduced [acquisition and divestiture] volumes, a significant widening of non-investment grade spreads and a pullback in the bank market"". In total, the 60 largest banks have provided $3.8tn to fossil fuel companies since 2016, when the Paris agreement came into effect. Overall, lending and debt and equity underwriting for the sector fell 9 per cent to $750bn in 2020, but climate change experts do not see this drop as a sign that banks are making good on their climate promises. ""It's essentially a Covid blip until proven otherwise. And history does suggest that's what it is,"" said Alison Kirsch, lead climate and energy researcher at RAN. The overall trend ""is still heading definitively in the wrong direction,"" the RAN report says. In recent weeks, leading US banks, including Citi, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have all made commitments to reduce their so-called ""financed emissions"". But, according to RAN, most banks' net-zero plans are ""dangerously weak, half-baked or vague"". However, there is evidence that campaigns from pressure groups, backed by ESG-conscious institutional investors, are accelerating change in the industry after years of resistance. HSBC avoided a potential shareholder revolt at its annual meeting this month by amending its climate policy to incorporate the demands of activists after months of negotiations.    Europe's largest bank has now proposed to set formal, near-term targets to reduce its exposure to carbon-intensive assets and report on its progress. HSBC was involved in $23bn of fossil fuel financing in 2020, according to the RAN report, down from $28bn the year before, for a total of $111bn since 2016.

I don't mean ""people are our greatest asset"" or puff about ""harnessing talent"" and ""leveraging creativity"". But the basics: how are they employed? How are they paid? How quickly do they leave? How are they looked after if they stay? In terms of disclosure, if not intention, S has long been the poor relation in the ESG family. Consensus has been slower to form on what companies could or should disclose about their ""social"" commitments, than their environmental impact or governance. Disclosure varies by market and the UK fares better than, say, the US. But, according to FTSE Russell, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of large and midsized companies in developed markets provide data on the most disclosed environmental items that are tracked by sustainably-minded investors. But there is only 5-15 per cent disclosure at the other end of the spectrum. Those least elucidated areas tend to be the ""social"" ones. The upshot is that the corporate world seems more eager to send signals about its efforts to protect the planet than to talk about the workers who have to live on it. Even ticking all the standard boxes does not give a decent picture. Look at the London Stock Exchange's ESG Disclosure Report, which tracks the quantitative building blocks of good disclosure. It includes measures of staff turnover, training and share of temporary employees. But a 100 per cent score still would not give an investor good, comparable information on whether a company uses insecure employment models, or how staff have been safeguarded during the pandemic. As Deliveroo, a posterchild for the gig economy, nears its London listing, investors should be pushing to hear more about staff from everyone. First, the risks of getting it wrong on social issues have become obvious. ""Relationships with community stakeholders"" sounds like ESG fluff, but disregard for them has sent the chief executive and chair of Rio Tinto packing after the destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves in Western Australia. The lingering cloud over Boohoo shows why investors should be paying close attention to people not just those employed directly but also those working in the supply chain. Second, workforce issues are moving up the agenda. Uber's defeat in the Supreme Court, and subsequent decision to classify its 70,000 UK drivers as workers, means more questions about the future of insecure employment models. The government is under renewed pressure to remember where it hid the 2017 Taylor Review and act on its recommendations. Yet the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association in 2018 found only 11 per cent of FTSE 100 companies gave a breakdown of full-time and part-time staff, and only 6 per cent disclosed the number, or proportion, of agency workers they used. The pandemic has also exposed injustices around work that cannot be ignored.    Those in low-paid and insecure work were more likely to risk their health to continue working in lockdowns. The problems caused by insecure contracts in areas such as social care, as well as poor sick pay provision more broadly, were very clear. Yes, the demands relating to ESG disclosure are exploding for companies. And yes, some social issues can be difficult to quantify. However, there are plenty of basic human resources data that companies could disclose and choose not to. When the Climate Action 100+ investor group contacted businesses about the creation of their net-zero company benchmark, released this week, 90 per cent of them replied. But when the PLSA, representing the billions managed by the pension industry, asked to discuss reporting on workforce issues with the FTSE 100, only seven took them up on it. If people are indeed a company's greatest asset, then investors should want to know far more about how they are being treated. helen.thomas@ft.com The pandemic has exposed injustices around work that cannot be ignored"
c106d93a5e8a3cfd232d,2021-03-22,Air-punching shareholders teach Toshiba a lesson,"B y lunchtime last Thursday, my phone was bubbling with texts from Toshiba's effervescent register of investors. Minutes earlier on March 18, they had triumphed in what would, not so long ago, have been a fantasy showdown with the conglomerate's management, winning a shareholder-proposed motion for the first time at a major Japanese firm. The tone of celebration after shareholders humbled Toshiba into convening an independent panel to investigate voting irregularities at last year's AGM ranged from circumspect to air-punching. But everyone (Japanese, and foreign, large and small) agreed that a balance long tilted towards companies had been tipped the other way and that rights had, at last, been righteously asserted. The significance of this happening at a household name like Toshiba is huge, as is the fact that heavyweight global funds Norges Bank, California Public Employees' Retirement System and others voted with the activist. A vulnerability of management thinking has been exposed, not just for this troubled industrial icon, but for much of corporate Japan and, according to some texters that day, for other equity markets in the region. We have sent a message, fizzed one, ""about who actually owns a listed company in Asia"". The extraordinary and still unresolved doings at Toshiba highlight a visibly changing environment. Trackers of long-term trends in shareholder activism noted a year ago how sharply campaigning had increased in Asia, rising from a 5 per cent share of global activity in 2013 to 13 per cent in 2020 as South Korean and Singaporean companies became targets. Hong Kong, despite its size as a market, is still a minnow in activism. Japan rose to become the world's second-largest market for activist events after the US last year, according to the brokerage CLSA. The resumption after the pandemic lull has good momentum, noted the research firm Activist Insight in its latest survey, after falling less in Asia than elsewhere. Among the attractions, say activists who have initiated campaigns in the region, is that companies have the flabbiness you would expect from the longterm unthreatened. They also tend to be less well mentally fortified against shareholder stridency than companies in the US or UK. Another is the tailwind of the ESG investment boom and the legitimised lexicon of criticism it provides. And there has been the surprisingly potent framework of rights that shareholders in Japanese companies have long possessed but, for complex reasons, felt unable to exercise until now. That is spreading, not least because the large Asian government pension funds are more heavily invested in their domestic stock markets. South Korea's National Assembly recently passed an amendment to the commercial code that significantly strengthens minority shareholder rights, and which Nomura analysts predicted would encourage activists to seek to sway management policy more aggressively. But the Toshiba episode transcends this. The company's peculiar vulnerability to activism is the result of its desperation to remain listed at all costs. In 2015, Toshiba was caught in a major accounting fraud, followed by a debilitating collapse of its US nuclear business and the financial crisis. It was demoted from the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and was on the brink of a full delisting until Goldman Sachs stepped in with an emergency $5.4bn issuance of new shares. The price of that deal (in addition to the fees exacted by Goldman) was a redrawn shareholder register with a hard credo that listed companies belong and are answerable to their owners.    Companies in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region have been given leave to forget the pungency of this purist version of shareholder capitalism. This has been thanks to large blocs of docile investors, networks of cross shareholdings, or a comfort that some soft-focus local version of shareholder capitalism applies. Toshiba could very easily have given its largest shareholder, Effissimo, the independent investigation it asked for without the humiliation of an extraordinary general meeting, a failed anti-activist campaign by Goldman Sachs and a vote that unified activists and the traditionally more laissez-faire investors against management. But, in its heart, this is a company that cannot abide the idea of being pushed around by its owners. For most of its existence, Toshiba would have got away with that, but it badly misjudged the times, costing it dear. Its intransigence has granted the most visible ever success to an exercise of shareholder rights, inadvertently drawing a road map that investors across Asia may now choose to follow. leo.lewis@ft.com In its heart, the Japanese company cannot abide the idea of being pushed around by its owners"

Less than a year after a vast majority of Danone's shareholders voted in favour of becoming a purpose-led organisation, its chief executive Emmanuel Faber has been knocked out because activist investors such as Bluebell Capital Partners and Artisan Partners accuse the company of chronic underperformance (FT.com, March 17). Yet both investors claim to promote environmental, social and governance investing. For instance, Bluebell, which is a signatory of the PRI, the world's leading proponent of responsible investment, states on its website: ""As active long-term investors we are naturally focused on material ESG factors which can impact the performance of the companies in which we invest, and the responsible stewardship of our investments."" Until the odds of this boxing match between sustainability and shareholder value change, the private sector will not rise to meet these challenges. This match will have more rounds and it is time to recognise that sustainability needs champions like Faber, more than the hypocrisy of such investors who pay nothing more than lip service to ESG.

d40d10bff4fee2126fd8,2021-03-19,Danone is a case study in the pitfalls of purpose,"CEO's departure shows need to marry sustainability with profitability The G in ESG did for Danone's chief executive Emmanuel Faber in the end. Under a governance compromise, the champion of environmental and social responsibility would have stayed as chair of the consumer goods group. That messy deal failed to satisfy activist investors. On Monday, the board replaced Faber with immediate effect. Last June, Faber congratulated Danone shareholders for ""toppling the statue of Milton Friedman"" after they voted to turn the company into an entreprise à mission, or purposedriven company. The late economist and author of the famous 1970 New York Times essay, headlined ""The Social Responsibility Of Business Is To Increase Its Profits"", seems to have had the last laugh. If France's most prominent advocate of purpose-driven capitalism cannot make it work, critics are bound to ask what is the purpose of ""purpose""? Over the past few years, the P-word has been badly abused, as some companies hurry to veil business as usual in an off-the-shelf cloak of vision and values. Faber's abrupt fall will add to cynicism about the trend. He was vulnerable, though, not because he pushed Danone towards a multi-stakeholder model, but because he spent too much time talking up the ""mission"" and too little energising the ""enterprise"". Shareholders attacked him because Danone's returns lag behind those of rivals such as Nestlé and Unilever, which are also pushing their credentials as progressive, purpose-led businesses. Even Friedman acknowledged that acts of social responsibility were ""one way for a company to generate goodwill as a byproduct of expenditures that are entirely justified in its own selfinterest"". Research published in 2017 in the Strategic Management Journal suggests, though, that while investment in such acts slightly reduces the likelihood of chief executives being dismissed when financial performance is good, it greatly increases the chance they will be shown the door when their company underperforms. How business leaders sell their vision matters, too. Faber's management style put some board members' and investors' backs up. Many US chief executives who signed the Business Roundtable 2019 statement on purpose, diluting shareholder primacy, did so without consulting board directors, according to Harvard Law School researchers. Despite his early success in rallying board and investors round his long-term vision, even Paul Polman, Unilever's former chief executive and another vocal evangelist for purpose, eventually became disconnected from shareholders. The approach of his lower-profile successor Alan Jope may provide a better model of how to interweave sustainability and profitability. Faber's fall comes at a critical point. A backlash against purpose-driven capitalism was overdue. Activists of the Friedman school are now doing battle with a new tribe of campaigning ESG investors, who believe their companies face extinction if they do not pursue environmental and social goals. Chief executives' job their mission, even has always involved reconciling multiple demands. The mess in the Danone boardroom is a reminder that distractions from the core goal of making a profit can be dangerous. It does not, however, signal that leaders should rein in their ambition to go further and reassert the role of companies in society. The benefits for both business and society when they take account of the long-run social and environmental impact of their activities have only become clearer in recent years. To revert now to simplistic and damaging pursuit of crude share-price maximisation would be a mistake."
7bb6b52be05b16b7ad9c,2021-03-19,Danone's activist coup reveals tricky quest to match ESG goals with profits,"Investors say ousted chief should have followed rival Nestlé's lead as he sought to reconcile targets Emmanuel Faber's seven years at the top of Danone ended at about 1:30am on Monday after a marathon virtual board meeting during which he battled to keep his job. As the French consumer goods group rapidly installed two joint interim chief executives, Faber's demise appeared to fit into a straightforward narrative. It was a victory for the activist funds which since January have laid siege to Danone, pushing for a radical overhaul to fix what they called chronic underperformance. But it marked a loss for those who prized the 57-year-old as a powerful advocate of the view that businesses must become more sustainable and forge a purpose alongside making profits. ""His legendary leadership in promoting stakeholder capitalism and ESG should be remembered among all who supported those philosophies,"" tweeted Hiro Mizuno, former head of Japan's pension funds who serves on a Danone oversight committee. But the saga at Danone is more complicated than a simple clash of greedy capitalists versus idealists, according to the investors, company executives and advisers involved. It comes at a critical juncture in the evolution of ""purposedriven"" capitalism, as companies face pressure to hardwire efforts to combat climate change or improve public health into their operations. Faber, a mountaineer and ascetic who eats little meat, is an advocate of a ""humanist"" capitalism, as he laid out in a speech at French business school HEC in 2016. He told a story about the death of his schizophrenic brother and how it had shaped his view that, ""without social justice, there is no more economy"". He concluded by asking the students, ""Who is your brother?"" to call them to find their higher purpose. But at the same time the charismatic executive, who joined Danone in 1997, was a demanding boss who churned through his top managers, according to people familiar with the matter. After initially pledging to protect jobs and boost employee benefits when Covid-19 hit, Faber announced a plan in October to slash 2,000 jobs, mostly in France. Although he talked up Danone brands such as Evian bottled water and Activia yoghurt, Faber presided over cuts to advertising budgets the lifeblood of consumer products keeping them below the sector average, according to analysts at Bernstein. Meanwhile, the board was complacent over a share price performance that lagged behind rivals such as Nestlé and Unilever, and did little as Faber cut annual profit forecasts three times in seven years, according to people familiar with the matter. Its oversight of management was hampered by poor governance, they said. Faber had held both the chair and chief executive roles since 2017, and a quarter of the board seats are occupied by former executives, including Franck Riboud, the former chief executive and son of Danone's spiritual founder Antoine Riboud. One of Faber's signature moments came last June, when shareholders voted to enshrine Danone's status as an entreprise à mission, or purpose-driven company, into its corporate bylaws.    In doing so, Danone made official an internal culture that began in 1972 when Antoine Riboud declared that business had a responsibility to further social progress beyond ""the factory gate or the office door"". ""It is all well and good to topple the statue of Milton Friedman,"" said one adviser, referring to Faber's declaration at the time that the vote was a repudiation of the US economist's view that the social responsibility companies have is to make profits. ""You can do that when your financial performance is better than competitors and your governance is above reproach, but if they aren't, then it is going to be a problem."" Further muddying any simple narrative is that the funds that called for Faber to go claim that they did not oppose Danone's work on environmental and social issues. ""Faber was trying to use sustainability as part of his defence,"" said Nicolas Ceron of Blue Bell Capital. ""But we never called into question Danone's ESG investments, and we care a lot about these topics ... Their competitors like Nestlé and Unilever also make ESG a priority, yet have better financial results. Our issue with Faber was not ideological but operational."" Ioannis Ioannou, who teaches at London Business School and advises asset managers on sustainability, said the saga showed the need to develop new ways to assess performance as companies tackled broader goals beyond maximising profits. ""There is a need to develop new metrics to judge companies and management, and investors want more transparency and reliable data on ESG,"" he said. Danone is far from being the only company struggling to chart this course. Orbia, a Mexican conglomerate, dismissed its chief executive and reversed his plan to make the business more green by selling the vinyls division that drove profits. At Danone, Faber had begun to address the sagging share price by promising last year to sell slow-growing brands, cut €1bn in costs and embark on a reorganisation, dividing the group along geographical lines instead of categories. But Faber's hand was weakened by the pandemic. Danone's businesses in dairy and yoghurts, baby formula and bottled water have been hit hard by lockdowns while pushing up costs. Nor does it sell household cleaning products, which have turbocharged the performance of consumer goods groups such as Reckitt Benckiser and Procter & Gamble. ""They have massively underperformed when every other grocery staple business has enjoyed a boom,"" said one banker in the sector. The attacks from shareholders picked up pace last month. US fund Artisan Partners, Danone's third-largest investor, urged the board to ditch Faber, halt the reorganisation and sell more assets. The messenger was notable: Artisan's adviser was Jan Bennink, who spent years in Danone's dairy and medical nutrition businesses and knew some board members including Riboud. As the crisis deepened, the board was split on what to do, according to people familiar with the matter. Leaks proliferated in the media as different factions on the board jostled. By early March, Danone thought it had a solution that would end the fight with activists. The chair and chief executive roles, both then held by Faber, would be split and a new chief executive recruited, it announced. Faber would remain chair and his strategy and plan for the group would be maintained. The fragile attempt at compromise lasted barely two weeks, with shareholders alarmed that any new chief executive would be hamstrung with Faber as chair. The activists began laying the groundwork for challenging the board at Danone's April shareholder meeting. It would not come to that. At the meeting on Sunday, Gilles Schnepp, former chief executive of industrial group Legrand who joined the Danone board in December, was named chair and will lead the search for a new chief executive. Warren Ackerman, an analyst at Barclays, said the boardroom coup would usher in a new era at Danone. But he cautioned that the task for the new boss would be challenging and any turnround could take up to two years. ""Danone needs to restore competitiveness in many parts of their business where they have been losing share,"" he said. ""It will be important to get a really big name as CEO that will make investors sit up and take notice."" In his first public comments since his exit, Faber late on Tuesday tweeted a thank you to the staff at Danone ""who every day bring the mission to life"".    Even without him, few people who know Danone expect it to abandon the pursuit of ideals that took root with Riboud decades ago.

8ae435f42677b63adb94,2021-03-17,US inflation and 'taper tantrum' risks overtake Covid on investor worry list,"Asset management Coronavirus has been displaced for the first time since the early days of the pandemic as the top risk that keeps investors up at night, according to a new poll of fund managers. Money managers polled by Bank of America now see inflation and an unruly rise in borrowing costs like that seen during the 2013 ""taper tantrum"" as the key tail risk that could unsettle global markets. The survey of investors with $597bn in assets under management highlights investors' concern that the economic recovery from Covid-19, backed by unprecedented stimulus, may unleash a surge of price growth that could be difficult to tame. Rising inflation expectations and bets that central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, may have to tighten policy sooner than planned have triggered a widespread sell-off in government bond markets which investors worry could get worse. ""It's a Catch-22 for the Fed,"" said Jim Caron, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ""They want to communicate that they are going to be patient but the more patient they are, the more people will worry about inflation."" Investors in the BofA poll expect that inflation will rise, at least in the near term, with an all-time high of a net 93 per cent of managers in the survey anticipating more rapid price increases in the coming year. A majority now see higher economic growth going hand in hand with higher inflation. Previously, investors had been more optimistic about a ""goldilocks scenario"" of lower inflation paired with strong growth. ""We believe 2020 likely marked a secular low point for inflation and interest rates,"" BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said last week. Expectations of rising inflation have sent shockwaves through the bond market, since inflation eats away at the interest payments on bonds. The US 10-year Treasury yield has risen past 1.6 per cent, up from 0.9 per cent in January, as investors sold the debt. Meanwhile, the 10-year break-even rate, a key measure of inflation expectations, is near its highest level since 2014. Traders have worried about a repeat of the taper tantrum of 2013 when the prospect of the Fed withdrawing stimulus following the global financial crisis prompted a severe sell-off in bonds. ""Previous episodes have demonstrated that what starts as a benign correction could evolve into a tantrum with wider consequences. Our modelling of a severe market scenario finds a significant impact on growth,"" said Innes McFee, chief global economist at Oxford Economics. A large share of fund managers in the survey said a 2 per cent yield on 10-year Treasuries would prompt a correction of at least 10 per cent in equity markets.    Investors reported the biggest cut in 15 years to their exposure to tech stocks, which have suffered during the bond market rout. Bets on tech were still deemed the ""most crowded trade"", followed by bitcoin and ESG. 'We believe 2020 likely marked a secular low point for inflation and interest rates'"
cd196083398332390b09,2021-03-17,ESG aims linked to more chiefs' pay,"FTSE 100 Almost half of FTSE 100 companies have linked executive payouts to environment, social or governance (ESG) targets as investors step up demands for companies to adopt these nonfinancial goals in the forthcoming annual general meeting season. Just over a third have an ESG measure in their bonus plans, with an average weighting of 15 per cent of this payout linked to meeting these goals. About one in five in the FTSE 100 include such targets in their long-term incentive plans (LTIPs). But nearly half of ESG measures used in judging CEO pay are not deemed ""material"" to shareholder value, according to a report from the London School of Economics and PwC. The report uses materiality measures set out by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the independent standardssetting organisation. Tom Gosling, executive fellow at London Business School's Centre for Corporate Governance, said that this was ""striking"", adding that it ""will be interesting to see how this plays out over time as most investors are making it clear they expect companies' ESG activities to focus on the areas that contribute to long-term shareholder value"". The most commonly used factor for determining bonuses was based on social goals such as diversity and employee engagement, while for long-term incentives it was the environment. The report also found ESG targets were shifting from traditional areas such as employee engagement and risk which tend to link to shareholder value towards newer and broader stakeholder concerns around the environment, sustainability and diversity. The report, which analysed pay plans in FTSE 100 annual reports published in 2020, said about 45 per cent of companies were using ESG measures for their pay, a rise of about 10 per cent compared with 2019. Investors are increasingly demanding that management build in ESG targets to pay agreements, with companies' behaviour towards such non-financial goals set to be a focus in this year's annual meetings. Many companies have started holding investor days specifically for their ESG plans. Phillippa O'Connor, reward and employment leader at PwC, said that there had been an ""explosion in interest from investors and companies in linking executive pay to ESG targets"". Broader societal concerns, such as climate and inclusion and diversity, reflect boards' broader view of ""responsibilities to stakeholders, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act"", she said. The most common factor for determining bonuses was based on social goals such as diversity"
6aa09f9abaedb216470f,2021-03-16,Counting the cost of climate change risks needs to be improved,"INSIDE BUSINESS FINANCE Listed companies appear to be competing with each other to be the most forthcoming on climate change disclosure. We are in era where investing on the principles of environmental, social and governance matters is on the rise and companies have responded. The ESG sections of company annual reports now provide expansive information on the environmental impact of such things as carbon gas emissions. Less good though is the disclosure on the financial impact of climate change issues. If, say, a company was likely to face a bill in the future to buy permits to emit carbon, that is an impact that could be accounted for. Likewise if an ageing steel plant had to be written down in value if its longevity is curtailed by tougher environmental standards, an impairment is required. But how and which costs should be accounted are still being defined. I asked one steel sector analyst recently what they did to assess the financial impact on climate change issues on forecasts for the companies he covered. The response: ""Nothing."" It was seen as too hard and there is too little clarity on what the standards of reporting should be. Other analysts are making more endeavours but more much work needs to be done by investors, research teams and accounting rule-setters. Markets are clearly signalling it is important. Investors have already sniffed out which sectors have the greatest impact on global warming and priced them accordingly. Some sectors; such as oil and gas; have fallen in value greatly. It would seem something is brewing among those who police financial reporting. Outside the US, both the International Organisation of Securities Commissions and the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation are edging towards clearer standards. In the past week they announced they would set up a separate Sustainability Standards Board to finalise standards. While this board should be announced before the November COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, the standards will not come so soon. If a company emissions and carbon price In America, responsibility for financial disclosure on these issues falls under the Securities and Exchange Commission. A new head of the SEC under the Biden administration has not yet been confirmed. then it should disclose its But the acting head of the SEC, Allison Herren Lee, last month said the commission would ""enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings"". One area worthy of better disclosure is in the management discussion and analysis of a company's annual report, or periodic income statement. One area in particular that could be focused on is the cost of carbon emissions. For example, in the EU, companies that emit carbon are required to reduce these by 2030. Effectively they have carbon budgets. They can use up some of their own carbon credits, provided freely by the EU, or buy carbon credits in a traded market to offset their emissions.    Buying credits is a rising cost. The EU has cut back on the supply of available credits for industry and accelerated the required rate of emission reductions in the 40 years to 2030 from 40 per cent to 55 per cent. This has helped pushed the EU carbon price to $48 per tonne, up 83 per cent in one year. In regions other than the EU, there may also be a benchmark carbon price for companies to assess the costs of their emissions, but less actively traded. If a company has declared emissions and there is a carbon price benchmark, then it should be able to disclose its financial risk. Yet companies have no requirement to disclose this. Take BP, the oil producer, for example. It states that it assumes a $100 per tonne cost for its emissions for 2030. But despite reporting emissions and this estimated cost, it does not state the financial impact. And the sums are not trivial for companies, particularly in sectors such as steel and cement, which emit large amounts of carbon. If BP's $100 carbon price is used as a benchmark, steelmaker ArcelorMittal and cement producer Buzzi Unicem generated emissions in 2019 worth as much as 3.5 times their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation that year, based on FT calculations. Many corporates will not want more expenses heaped upon them. Yet many shareholders should want a better idea of the financial risk they face. Financial directors as well as investors are keen to find some compromise. alan.livsey@ft.com If a company has declared emissions and there is a carbon price benchmark, then it should be able to disclose its financial risk"
c0c4bb534e299d3eef6c,2021-03-15,Climate plans of big firms need substance,"W hat will you be doing in 2050? As individuals, most of us struggle to picture what our lives will be like almost 30 years from now. But many of the world's largest companies and their bankers sound serenely sure of the future. To believe their press releases, the midpoint of this century will be the moment when they will no longer emit a single puff of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere without doing something that removes a similar amount. Companies as diverse as 3M and Mastercard, and as fossil-fuelled as BP and Shell, have set ""net-zero"" goals for 2050. Forests will be planted, supply chains will be cleaned up and new technologies will replace dirty power plants, belching trucks and inefficient office buildings. The world's largest lenders to carbonemitting industries are following suit, with Wells Fargo's wind farm-illustrated announcement last week making it the last of the big six US banks to set such a target. A search on the financial data service Sentieo shows that mentions of 2050 in corporate announcements have doubled in the past two years. But much like Saint Augustine asking to be made chaste (just not yet), such faroff goals raise the suspicion that some executives would like more time before they, or preferably their successors, must embrace environmental virtue. Today's CEOs ""will all be retired or dead"" by 2050, says Patrick McCully, Rainforest Action Network's climate and energy programme director, a little harshly. Boards may have felt under pressure to come out with net-zero commitments, he says, but he fears they will now ""take the pedal off the metal in terms of how they're actually implemented"". Such concerns are understandable. A PwC survey released last week showed climate change ranked only ninth among global CEOs' perceived threats to growth. More than a quarter of the executives polled claimed to be unconcerned by a warming planet. The scepticism is reinforced by the lack of detail most companies have given investors on how they intend to hit their distant targets and, most importantly, how they plan to start working towards them now. But about a quarter of S&P 500 members had made net-zero commitments by the end of 2020, according to FCLTGlobal, which champions long-term investing, and the number is growing fast. Some, such as FedEx and Walmart, aspire to emissions equilibrium in 2040, while less carbon-intensive businesses from PwC to Sky hope to get there as soon as 2030. Critics have spent decades complaining that companies cannot see beyond the next quarter, so even environmen-talists agree that their apparent willingness to tackle such long-term challenges is welcome, especially given that it has emerged despite the short-term pressures of the pandemic. It is also increasingly good business. With President Joe Biden promising to put the US on ""an irreversible path"" to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, most major economies are leaning on the private sector to meet the goals set out in the Paris climate agreement, which will require trillions of dollars of investment in green technologies.    Their shareholders, too, are turning up the heat. In 2019, 34 asset owners managing $5.5tn pledged to zero out the net emissions from their portfolios within 30 years. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, has warned it may vote against directors who do not take the issue seriously. Most companies with the sense and resources to make even minimal environmental, social and governance commitments have benefited from the vast sums poured into such funds in recent years. But investors are getting choosier, and influential new EU rules on which investment products can call themselves ""sustainable"" are expected to make them more alert to greenwashing. ""Net-zero pathways"" have slipped easily into the corporate jargon. But investors need to see meaningful milestones along those paths to 2050, starting with a clear plan for aligning with the UN goal of halving emissions from their 2010 level by the end of this decade. Companies cannot get away with doing little towards their 2050 goals until 2049, says Bob Eccles, the Saïd Business School professor and sustainability expert. ""Give me interim targets,"" he says. ""Give me the narrative and then tell me what is the logic behind why [you think] you're going to get to x per cent by 2030 and y per cent by 2040."" The expected launch this year of a sustainability standards board by the IFRS Foundation, which oversees international accounting standards, should make ESG reporting more consistent. But for now investors are suffering from a shortage of meaningful data by which they can track progress and dissuade executives from fudging the numbers if they miss their targets, Eccles warns. Without measurable commitments about what changes must be made in the near term, companies' 30-year plans will ring hollow, however well-intended they may be. If investors are as serious as they claim to be about ESG, they should insist on meaningful annual reporting on companies' progress towards those goals, and hold directors to account who continue to see the challenge as a problem for the next generation. And if they really want to focus attention on the task, they might also encourage boards to tie more executives' pay to the progress they make in fulfilling it. andrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com There is a lack of detail from most companies on how they intend to hit their distant 2050 targets"
70c1b0504b96d4456895,2021-03-13,Want a greener world? Don't dump oil stocks,"Merryn Somerset Webb Investing f you are nice person you won't hold shares in any companies involved in fossil fuels or mining. ITheir activities are dirty, environmentally unsound and that's that. You can't believe the planet is in trouble and also hold businesses involved in creating that trouble. End of. This is certainly the view of Friends of the Earth. The group has recently produced research showing that British local government pension funds have almost £10bn invested in ""climate wrecking companies"" even though many councils have expressed fears of a ""climate emergency"". Shocking. Or is it? Might there be another way of looking at this, one that is hard to hear over a cacophony of ostentatious do-goodery? The first question to ask is exactly what divesting selling shares in ""bad"" companies of this sort achieves. Sure, it makes it harder for firms that might want to raise new money via equity markets and, if the generalised disapproval makes banks wary too, it might raise the cost of debt too. But for firms already chucking out cash, it makes no difference at all and certainly none to current oil and gas production. When you sell the shares, someone else buys them and the business just carries on. The transition to cleaner energy is under way. But it's going to take several decades. In the meantime we need traditional sources of energy. Shouting at oil doesn't change that. You could even call it, as the UK pensions minister did this week, ""reverse greenwashing"" something that makes you look good but does nothing to fix the problem. You can argue this even more forcefully when it comes to miners. If you want to get rid of the combustion engine and find me someone who says they don't you need copper, as copper wire is one of the best ways to move electricity around. You will need mountains of rare earth metals too, for the magnets in electric motors and lithium for batteries. A medium-sized electric car contains 2-3 times as much copper as a comparable conventional car. Net zero might be a grubbier business than some like to think. What we want, then, is not no oil, no tin and no copper, but carefully produced oil, tin and copper. How do you get that? Probably not by flouncing off in a huff. Enter impact investing, the idea that big investors should stay invested and encourage better behaviour. This is harder than flouncing, but it works. Energy companies, especially European majors, are spending huge amounts on wind and solar and ""committing vast sums for developments such as green hydrogen and carbon capture,"" says John Teahan of investment group RWC Partners. Shell, Total and BP are all aiming for net zero by 2050. It is the job of shareholders not to abandon them, but to ensure they stay on track and to ""encourage them to go faster and further where possible"". Paul Jourdan, of Amati, the investment house, says something similar about miners. Here long-term environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are endless from bribery to water pollution and worker safety. But again, regulation and engagement work: the past 15 years have seen ""huge change"", with most miners offering ""meaningful information"" on ESG aspects, he says.    There's something else divesting cheerleaders need to bear in mind. Selling shares might not make any difference to a business, but it makes a difference to who owns the business. If you make a big institutional holder who really cares about, say, the climate, sell to a private holder who really doesn't, what exactly have you achieved? Imagine Friends of the Earth persuading all UK funds to sell fossil fuel firms. Those sales push the share prices down and down again. They become very cheap. But those who invest in listed companies are too media-aware to buy them back. The result? The companies are taken private by someone, maybe in the UK, maybe abroad, who doesn't care what Friends of the Earth thinks. Now not only are its assets held by someone who might be, as Total's chief executive puts it, less ""mindful"" of ESG matters than the original holders, but also by someone who doesn't have to bother with the transparency and stewardship obligations that come with a public listing. Is that really what we want? Note that according to data from Dealogic, five British companies have been taken private this year already, including power equipment firm Aggreko, on top of 34 in the past two calendar years. There's one more thing you need to think about. The money. The UK's pension funds and the big retail facing funds serve an important social purpose. They are there to finance your future. The core part of their job (for all the grandstanding about other stuff) is to compensate you for the years you put into boring Zoom calls with the capital and income for a pleasant retirement. So if renewable energy stocks are ridiculously expensive and old energy stocks are cheap, do pension funds have a responsibility to sell the former and buy the latter? And if Exxon provides an income of more than 5 per cent a year and that income is handy, why should they let someone else have it? Not for us thanks. Our pensioners have morals. Let those nice chaps in private equity have the money instead. Hmm. And I'll add another hmm to that on the basis that most pension funds hold private equity too. Let them take over a dirty company and the odds are you will find you still own it you'll just be paying higher fees to less accountable management for the privilege. If you care about the planet, there is a case to be made for holding more fossil fuel and mining stocks. Better they are in the right hands. With that in mind, look to UK value and income funds (they mostly hold this stuff). Two investment trusts I have mentioned before, the revamped Temple Bar (which I own) and BlackRock Energy and Resources Income are good places to start. And if you are one of 7m people with cash in the UK's local pension funds, maybe drop them a line explaining that just maybe, holding fossil fuel firms is one of the most socially responsible things an engaged and financially-aware investor can do.

30702a3657c65cfeb478,2021-03-13,How can I make my investments more ethical?,"ESG FUNDS Options galore in a complex and untransparent sector Demand for ethical funds has soared in recent years as investors look to put their money to work in ways that make them feel good. In the UK, sales of ethical funds have tripled in 2020, according to the Investment Association. The amount invested in ethical funds jumped to £10bn for the year from £3.2bn in 2019. Almost 20 per cent of all money invested in December 2020 flowed into ethical investment funds. Investors who are interested in adding more ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investments to their Isa portfolios can choose from hundreds of options as the sector has grown in popularity. The government is also fuelling the trend, recently announcing it would launch green bonds, to be offered to retail investors through National Savings & Investments, the state-backed savings scheme. But the reality of investing ethically remains complex and the burden largely falls to investors to determine what represents an ethical investment for them, experts say. ""Those who wish to invest ethically do need to put a bit more elbow grease into picking their funds,"" says Laith Khalaf, an analyst at investment brokerage AJ Bell. ""Not only do they need to pick a quality fund manager, they also need to make sure the fund measures up to their own ethical criteria."" Some evidence suggests the trend towards ethical investing is still a young one for Isas. Though the average amount of Isa funds invested in socially responsible funds on Interactive Investor, an investment platform, has doubled in the past three years, it still accounts for a small fraction of Isa money managed on the platform. Just 3 per cent of total fund assets in the UK are managed under ""responsible"" funds, according to the IA. How ethical funds are defined is still an issue for debate within asset management. Some funds operate by excluding certain ""sin"" stocks such as pure coal or tobacco. Other funds focus on themes such as renewable energy or measurable positive social impacts, while some just track indices but adjust their weighting away from less ethical stocks. It is up to investors to look under the hood of their investments, and determine which approaches they are most comfortable with. Investors looking to build diverse portfolios have options, but there are some trade-offs, advisers say, such as high dividend payments. ""There are enough ethical funds available to be able to construct a well-balanced portfolio,"" says Myron Jobson, personal finance campaigner at Interactive Investor. ""However, there are a few gaps, most notably in the income space ... Many of the big dividend payers [such as oil companies] are difficult to label 'ethical'."" And investors must also consider their priorities. Why exactly do you want your money to grow in ethical investment vehicles, as opposed to more traditional stocks and shares? ""The first critical question to ask yourself is, are you investing for your legacy because you're trying to make the world a better place, and you don't mind underperformance,"" says Dana D'Auria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet, a technology and service provider for financial advisers. ""Or are you investing because you believe these companies outperform over    time?"" Lots of factors can be brought into play to determine whether a stock can be considered ethical, and investors must decide which are most important to them. Threefifths of clients on Interactive Investor say environmental impact is the criterion they consider most important for ESG investments. ""The S and G are equally important, depending on your moral values,"" says Jobson. ""Don't like the idea of investing in companies involved in animal testing and armament production? There are funds that strip out such organisations from their investment universe."" Investors should not ""let the perfect be the enemy of the good"", Khalaf says. ""It's probably worth approaching the process [of determining ethical investing red lines] with a willingness to compromise."" Analysts at Interactive Investor point to the BMO Responsible UK Income fund for income investors, which targets long-term income and growth by investing mainly in UK shares and yields around 3.7 per cent. Investors looking to get ethical exposure while keeping costs down might consider the growing number of exchange traded funds with ethical exposure, though advisers note that these vehicles often have less stringent screening for their underlying investments than actively managed funds. ""ETFs definitely have an advantage in allowing investors to participate in a theme or sector indiscriminately. However, this is more problematic when applied to ESG themes which tend to be quite nuanced, often highly personal to the investor and sometimes more difficult to define in a uniform fashion,"" says Isabel Kwok, investment manager at JM Finn. To filter out funds that are simply jumping on the trend without recasting their investments, Kwok says: ""I look for managers who have been investing in the area before it became popular, especially those who are well connected on these issues and can demonstrate a passion for the sector."" ""Beware of greenwashing, where companies just clean themselves up on the surface to blend in with the ESG craze,"" says Dan Lane, a senior analyst at low-fee platform Freetrade. ""When it comes to your personal ethics, you'll have to be a bit more discerning in the broader market."" The most widely held ESGfocused ETFs on the platform include iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, L&G Battery Value-Chain ETF and Renewables Infrastructure Group. ""ESG isn't a fringe concept any more,"" says Lane. Its strong performance has helped mainstream ethical investing. ""The spring back in highly rated ESG firms over 2020 showed they weren't idealists, they were actually just good companies."" Beware of greenwashing, where companies just clean themselves up on the surface to blend in with the ESG craze"
f8b47a681b0928b7769e,2021-03-13,Five key points to ponder for this year's Isa investors,"The number of millionaires in the tax-efficient vehicle has surged in the past year and the sector has also seen the entrance of thousands of newcomers, writes Claer Barrett 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 The number of Isa millionaires with portfolios on investment platforms has nearly doubled in the past year, as surging stock markets boost assets held in tax-free investment accounts to record highs. Nearly 1,400 Isa millionaires people with an Isa balance of £1m and more were on the books of the three big UK platforms in early February. Interactive Investor had 731, Hargreaves Lansdown 579 and AJ Bell 55. That is up from 725 the year before. The investors are a distinct group older than the general population, with an average age of 70, investing consistently over time, with most having used the maximum Isa allowance since the vehicles were launched in 1999, and backing ""growth"" stocks, such as tech companies. They are among the most financially successful of the 22m UK adults who, as of April 2019, held around £584bn in Isa accounts, according to HM Customs & Revenue data covering both cash and investment Isas. But could it be that their growth strategy targeting stocks with capital appreciation rather than incomeproducing potential is running out of steam, after delivering rewards for two decades? Isa investors of all ages are starting to worry about recent falls in valuations of tech stocks amid general concerns that ultra-low interest rates may have inflated asset prices. It is not just market wobbles that raise concerns. Potential changes to the UK tax system following the pandemic mean there has never been a more urgent need to maximise taxfree allowances. FT Money reveals five strategic points for Isa investors to consider as they navigate markets this year. Is growth running out of steam? The combination of growth investments and a tax-free wrapper has worked well. When it comes to funds and investment trusts, platform data show the top 10 holdings of Isa millionaires invariably include a heavy bias towards tech. Baillie Gifford's flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust is a top 10 trust holding for millionaires across all three platforms mentioned above, powered by holdings including Amazon, Tencent and Tesla. Despite a stellar performance during the pandemic, shares in the trust have fallen more than 16 per cent in the past month, as rising US bond yields and inflationary fears spark a tech sell-off. ""The ability of investment trusts to gear [borrow] to enhance returns means they can give a portfolio a turbo charge over the long term but this can also drag down performance further in volatile times,"" says Moira O'Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor. Other popular trust choices across the three big platforms include other tech-heavy Baillie Gifford funds the Monk's Trust, Scottish American and Edinburgh Worldwide plus Murray International Trust, Polar Capital Technology Trust, Alliance Trust and Fidelity China Special Situations. Isa millionaires also favour growth when it comes to the top investment funds, with Fundsmith and Blue Whale being two of the most popular.    As tech valuations totter, the older millionaires face a classic rich person's problem is now the time to take profits? ""It really is the million pound question,"" says Holly Mackay, founder and chief executive of consumer website Boring Money. ""Tech proponents would say it's not a bubble, and that we should rethink sky-high valuations in light of how the world is changing. But plenty of really sensible people think we're in line for a major correction."" She has taken profits. However, she accepts that investors who trim their holdings will have to ""get over some serious Fomo"" [fear of missing out] if tech's growth spurt continues. FT readers considering this dilemma should take account of their investment timeframe and other investment assets. ""If you've got a million pounds in an Isa, you've probably got quite a bit of money in pensions and property too,"" says Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell. ""You might feel you can afford to take a bit more risk with your Isa for longer."" One practical step is taking a socalled ""X-ray"" of a portfolio to reveal the underlying mix of stocks and so highlight any concentration risk. ""A lot of global funds have got doubledigit holdings in Apple, Tesla, Facebook and the usual suspects, and when you look under the bonnet, people are often holding the same stocks in other funds, or even via direct holdings,"" says Mackay. Most UK retail platforms have an ""X-ray tool"" if yours doesn't, you could set up a test account with one that does and input your portfolio details. In a few clicks, you can see how your portfolio is split between various sectors and regions, your exposure to large-cap versus small-cap companies, and any bias towards growthstocks, cyclicals (which tend torebound when the economyexpands) or defensives (such as utilities and supermarkets, which tend toweather storms better). For those considering taking profits, the next quandary is reinvestingthe proceeds. Some evidence of a switch into value investing finding solidly performing companies overlooked by others is emerging in AJ Bell's investor data, says Khalaf. ""The most popular stocks of 2021 so far include GameStop and Argo Blockchain, but we're increasingly seeing value plays like National Consolidated Airlines and easyJet, with investors hoping for a boost as foreign travel resumes,"" he says. As companies restore dividends, yields on income funds (including global equity income funds) are starting to tick up again, boosting their attractiveness but nervousness about the UK's post-Brexit economy has weighed heavily on UK-focused funds and trusts. Investors who have faith in the recovery could be tempted by cyclicals, with some pundits predicting a commodities comeback. ""Markets are already pricing in reflation but it's not a done deal,"" Khalaf notes. For now, it seems investors are putting their faith in fund managers. Platform data shows the popularity of low-cost passive funds is waning in favour of actively-managed ones. One year ago, Vanguard, the USbased passive fund manager, accounted for six out of the top ten most-bought funds at Interactive Investor. Today, active manager Baillie Gifford accounts for six. ""It does feel like we're getting into more of a stock picker's market, but if the good active managers can't outperform in more challenging markets, then I think they will face an existential crisis,"" adds Mackay. Using Isas for tax-free income When it comes to the direct equity holdings of Isa millionaires, it's a different story the platforms' top 10s are dominated by dividend-paying UK blue-chips. Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Lloyds Bank, GlaxoSmithKline and Unilever ar.e popular income stocks. Those with chunky Isa holdings have configured their portfolios to generate the maximum tax-free income. Within an Isa, there's no dividend tax, nor does income tax apply to withdrawals. ""A £1m portfolio yielding 4 per cent generates a tax-free income of £40,000 per year, which is a pretty comfy retirement, especially when you add in any income from state and private pensions,"" says Khalaf.    However, wealth managers warn that while Isas are tax efficient for growing investments and generating an income, those with large holdings face the problem of inheritance tax (IHT). ""I consistently find that nobody wants to touch the money inside their Isa, but all they're doing is sitting around waiting to be taxed at 40 per cent,"" says Michael Martin, private client manager at 7IM. Although Isa money can be passed free of tax between spouses or civil partners upon the first death, after the second death it becomes part of the estate and within scope of IHT. The fear of inheritance tax One answer is to invest in qualifying Aim shares which, if held for more than two years, are subject to business property relief (BPR) and exempt from IHT. There are platforms offering ""Aim Isa"" portfolios. Boohoo, the Aim-listed online fashion retailer, is the most popular Aim share and the third most-bought stock overall on Interactive's platform. With a pandemic growth story, its shares have risen by 29 per cent the past 12 months. However, Aim shares can be volatile and there is a risk that the chancellor could take steps to end the BPR advantage for investors in future. ""Anyone considering Aim shares needs to understand that you don't just have to hold them for two years, but be holding them at the time of your death in order to qualify for BPR,"" Martin says. ""If you've run out of all other options, the Aim route could be worth the risk,"" he adds, giving the example of a 90-year-old client with a huge Isa portfolio which would have been subject to IHT on his death. ""He wasn't going to live for seven years, but there was a good chance he'd live for two more. His children were in on the conversation; we switched into Aim stocks, he survived for just over two years and this saved his family 40 per cent tax. But be warned these investments are not for the faint-hearted as they carry a much higher degree of risk, can be volatile and harder to sell."" Martin has a simpler idea if you can't spend the cash, give it away. ""So long as you survive for seven years, gifting large sums is a very tax-efficient way of recycling your own Isa into funding the £20,000 allowance for adult children or grandchildren, or the £9,000 Junior Isa for under-18s,"" he suggests. Those who can afford the maximum monthly Jisa subscription of £750 a month from existing income won't fall foul of current IHT rules. Generous grandparents should also remember that through a quirk of the system, 16 and 17-year-olds have a £20,000 cash Isa allowance on top of their Jisa. That's an extra £40,000 to be rolled into a stocks and shares Isa alongside their Jisa funds when they reach their 18th birthday. However, youngsters gain control of the account on this date: so spending time teaching them about managing a portfolio would be very wise. Avoiding capital gains tax Across the wealth management profession, minds are focused on possible changes to capital gains tax. Before the tax year ends on April 5, advisers are carrying out client CGT reviews to check for potential liabilities. Investments held outside an Isa or pension may be subject to CGT when sold, depending on the size of the gain and individual allowances. One option to explore is ""Bed and Isa"" essentially, selling down your holdings, settling any CGT liability, and then buying them again within an Isa. Depending on circumstances, married couples and civil partners can pool their CGT allowances (£12,300 per person) and Isa allowances (£20,000 per person). By straddling the tax year's end, it's possible for a couple to invest up to £80,000 within Isas in the next two months (£20,000 each, either side of April's tax year) offsetting gains of up to nearly £50,000. ""Changes to the CGT regime might not happen this year, but it's unlikely that the 20 per cent rate on equities for higher-rate taxpayers will ever be lower it's entirely possible it could be higher in future,"" says Martin. Using Isas to build future wealth Since the pandemic, the number of younger investors opening Isa accounts for the first time has surged.    Nearly one in 10 Isa investors got started in the past year, according to research by Boring Money. It found the three brands that young investors were most likely to have opened accounts with over the past 12 months were Trading 212, Moneybox and Hargreaves Lansdown, which Mackay says ""neatly matches the three types of Isa newcomers"". She says Trading 212 appeals to short-term traders; the robo-powered Moneybox app suits investors who want a simple way to get started, and Hargreaves which has overhauled its social media marketing appeals to those prepared to research and select their investments. For the young, tech and ESG funds (environmental, social and governance) funds have strong appeal. ""These are both tangible investment themes with a good consumer story,"" notes Mackay. However, she also worries a ""green bubble"" is building up. As an investor who ""rode the waves"" of the dotcom boom and bust in the early 2000s, she is wary. ""People are really buying into the green story, but if you look at valuations in this pocket of the market, it's definitely something to approach with caution."" Again, it comes back to the question of individual investors' timeframes. With age on their side and decades to build up tax-free investment pots, those at the start of their investing journey can better afford to hang on for the ride. However, experts worry that a sudden correction could unseat new investors, causing them to sell and abandon investing for good. Khalaf says today's millionaires have built up their Isa wealth despite being limited to a maximum £7,000 annual contribution for the first nine years that Isas were in existence. ""They have had to achieve an average 14 per cent annual growth on maximum Isa contributions to break through the £1m barrier,"" he says. Investing the enlarged £20,000 allowance over a period of 21 years, ""they would need a much more attainable 7 per cent growth to hit the £1m Isa jackpot, assuming the allowance doesn't change. That means the Isa millionaires of the future will be more plentiful, and younger."" But should they stop there? ""A million pounds today is enough to secure a comfortable retirement, but when you factor in inflation, in 20 or 30 years it may not be,"" says O'Neill. ""If you're young and starting out, ramping up the risk won't make nearly as much difference as increasing your contributions over time."" In other words, the more you put in, the more, eventually, you should get out."
9eef40ae46fb90884d20,2021-03-11,Deep focus on ESG risk is the way to avoid Nordic noir scenarios,"nternet blackouts in Myanmar. IPartly untreated rainwater from an aluminium plant flowing into a river in Brazil. Suspect payments linked to a front company of the daughter of Uzbekistan's former president. Potential money-laundering from Russia and Azerbaijan through the Baltics. Nothing initially seems to connect these disparate events, but behind them stand Nordic companies. The Nordic countries themselves are seen as purer than driven snow, regularly featuring close to the top of anticorruption rankings. But various Nordic groups from Telenor, Norsk Hydro and Telia to Danske Bank, Swedbank and Equinor have become implicated in uncomfortable situations outside their home region in recent years. Each case is different, but is there something common that underscores why Nordic companies keep on running into trouble abroad? Anna Romberg, former head of the anti-corruption programme at Swedish telecoms operator Telia and co-founder of the Nordic Business Ethics Network, thinks there could be. She says much of it has to do with how Nordic countries have high levels of trust while many of the countries that the companies have difficulties in do not. She says: ""Sometimes, Nordic people are called naive. I wouldn't say that. But there's a lack of understanding of how blessed we are. We have an independent, free press, strong trust. We don't realise that that context doesn't exist when we go abroad. You can't go into a highly corrupt country and just trust people blindly."" Telia's own case ended with its paying almost $1bn to US and Dutch regulators in 2017 after admitting that it had made $330m in corrupt payments to a front company linked to Gulnara Karimova, socialite daughter of longtime former Uzbek president Islam Karimov. Various from the region Telia's former chief executive and two other managers were acquitted by Swedish courts last month because Karimova was not in charge of telecoms policy in Uzbekistan, so the payments could not be classified as bribery. But there are questions about oversight. The Swedish state is, and was, Telia's largest shareholder. Critics argue that it appeared to do little to scrutinise Telia's entry into central Asia. become in uncomfortable situations ""Central Asia is high-risk, but I don't think many questions were asked about how Telia was behaving,"" says one banker. In Norway, the difficulties facing aluminium producer Hydro and telecoms group Telenor are very different. Neither is accused of corruption but both are in awkward positions, and there are doubts again over oversight, given that the Norwegian state is the largest shareholder for both. Aluminium producer Hydro is facing a court case in a Dutch court over claims that the ""incorrect disposal of toxic waste"" from operations in Brazil caused health problems, pollution and economic losses.    The group disputes the claim, arguing that while it might have let rainwater flow into a local river in 2018 after a torrential storm without properly treating it in breach of local licences, there was no evidence that the level of heavy metals exceeded requirements for drinking water. But Hydro does appear to have misread the situation in Brazil. An apology from the company's chief executive for poor communication after the storm was interpreted locally more as an admission of liability, insiders say. Telenor has faced scrutiny over its decision to build a mobile network in Myanmar since it entered the country in 2013, but the volume has increased since a military coup last month. The internet has been shut many times in Myanmar in recent weeks. After Telenor initially publicised each shutdown order as it was made, it has been banned from doing so since mid-February. ""That is a big concern for us,"" chief executive Sigve Brekke said last month. Romberg says that while companies are on top of their financial risks, environmental, social and governance risks are often outsourced to media, active investors and social interest groups to uncover. Such was the case with the laundering allegations in the Baltics levelled against Danske and Swedbank, aired by media with the help of whistleblowers. Nordic groups need to understand and integrate ESG risks fully in their decision-making, Romberg says. Otherwise, more Nordic companies could suffer uncomfortable incidents abroad. richard.milne@ft.com Various businesses from the region have become implicated in uncomfortable situations overseas"
7205ee9a52808a401021,2021-03-11,On guard against greenwashing,"With its sustainable finance disclosure regulations, the EU is leading the way in policing what can be considered an ESG fund. The rules could become the global standard and drive investment into the sector. By Attracta Mooney M arcus Björksten manages one of Europe's bestperforming sustainable funds. His Fondita Sustainable Europe product returned an impressive 41.6 per cent last year, while its benchmark lost around 3 per cent. It was a standout performance during a stellar year for sustainable investing, where environmental, social and governance issues are taken into consideration. ESG investing set record after record, with investors piling unprecedented levels of cash into sustainable funds, asset managers rushing to launch new products and research suggesting such investments outperformed mainstream rivals. ESG has become one of the most important shifts in the investment industry in a generation. Yet despite the recent fanfare about sustainable investing, Björksten says all is not what it seems. ""Greenwashing is a real problem,"" he warns referring to companies' promotion of environmental concerns as an advertising gimmick. Speaking from a cabin in northern Finland during a cross-country skiing trip, the portfolio manager says he seeks out businesses that provide products or services aimed at tackling the climate crisis. However, many of the funds that use the ESG label, he says, are not as sustainable as they appear. Several popular ESG funds, for example, invest in the world's largest carbon emitters. ""Nowadays, every second fund is claiming it is in some way sustainable."" As ESG becomes a part of the investment mainstream, it is reaching a critical juncture: without some way to police the way the concept is used, it runs the risk of being reduced to a marketing exercise with only modest substance. With that in mind, the most rigorous effort yet to provide structure to the market began yesterday, when the EU introduces new rules that are designed to prevent greenwashing. Under the European rules, which are part of a wider series of green finance regulations, investment products will effectively be categorised as sustainable and non-sustainable. Any asset manager that wants to market their fund as a sustainable product will be subject to tough disclosure requirements. ""The reporting will make it very difficult to have greenwashing,"" says Björksten. ""It will require a lot more work from the fund managers."" The new rules could have far-reaching consequences for asset managers not just in Europe but around the world as investment firms are forced to demonstrate they are serious about sustainability. They will also influence the decisions of listed companies which will be under pressure to focus more on ESG issues or risk losing investor capital. ""The EU wants to reorient capital to sustainable investments. If [a company] doesn't respect certain standards, they shouldn't be getting such easy access to capital,"" says Olivier Carré, a partner at consultancy PwC in Luxembourg, where the largest chunk of Europe's investment funds is based.    Rapid growth When former US vice-president Al Gore and a group of financial professionals set up Generation Investment Management in 2004, their efforts to create a long-term asset manager with a focus on sustainability were met with scepticism. ""People looked at us with pity and thought we were deluded,"" says Miguel Nogales, co-chief investment officer at Generation. At the time, ethical investing was largely the preserve of charitable foundations and religious orders. ""Fast forward to 2021 and ESG has become a thing,"" says Nogales. Now investors with more than $100tn in assets, such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Amundi, have signed a commitment, the Principles for Responsible Investment, to integrate ESG information into their investment decisions, while the total assets in specialist sustainable investing mutual funds hit a record of almost $1.7tn in 2020, up 50 per cent over the year. The industry's interest in ESG has been driven by a combination of factors including rising client demand with big pension funds as well as regular savers increasingly demanding sustainable investment options. ""Demographics are moving in favour of this revolution,"" says Gianfranco Gianfrate, professor of finance at Edhec Business School in France. ""The younger generations are really into sustainability and the environment and this translates into the products they are buying,"" he says. ""Covid amplified this interest."" The sector has also benefited from regulatory changes, such as UK rules that push pension funds to weigh ESG considerations, and a growing acceptance among investors that issues such as climate change could have huge financial repercussions. Many active investment managers which pick investments rather than track an index have also turned to ESG investing as a way to differentiate themselves at a time when their profit margins have come under intense pressure from the rise of passive investing. Strong performance, particularly last year, is also driving interest. A 2020 study by Morningstar, the data provider, found that a majority of sustainable funds have performed better than equivalent conventional funds over one, three, five and 10 years. Research from BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, says ESG strategies outperformed during last year's period of intense volatility; in the first quarter 94 per cent of leading sustainable indices beating their parent benchmarks. ""The experience of 2020 will help remove investors' worry that ESG investing means giving up returns,"" says Stephen Tu, vice-president at Moody's, the rating agency. Asoka Woehrmann, chief executive of DWS, the €793bn asset manager, agrees that the coronavirus crisis was an ""important stress test"" for ESG investing. ""There was a view that these products would be a good weather product,"" says Woehrmann. ""But the resilience of ESG products is remarkable."" EU lead With ESG becoming the biggest buzzword in investing, even the most cynical of asset managers have been jumping on the bandwagon. As well as launching new products, older funds have been rebadged as sustainable. Asset managers have also ramped up their hiring of specialist staff to focus on ESG and sustainability issues. Figuring out which asset managers are talking the talk on sustainability and which are taking concrete action, however, is far from simple. Many investors have struggled to find out what funds were invested in and just how seriously asset managers were thinking about issues such as climate change. James Alexander, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, says: ""Some [financial advisers] are saying almost every fund is marketed as sustainable now. How do they determine which are the most sustainable?"" As greenwashing by companies and fund managers has ramped up, regulators, policymakers and standard-setters have turned their attention to how investors can decipher sustainable investment products. Policymakers have also been keen to help direct cash to sustainable investments in an effort to meet countries' targets of cutting carbon emissions. The EU has been at the forefront of the focus on sustainable finance, planning a series of reforms, including a classification system for what counts as green corporate activities, and the new rules for the investment industry which are known as the sustainable finance disclosure regulations. Under the first stage of the SFDR rules, all asset managers will have to publish information on their sustainability processes. They also have to put investment products into three categories recognised as dark green, light green and non-sustainable depending on their climate and social impact. As part of the second stage, expected to come    into force in 2022, funds will have to report on issues such as carbon footprint, investments in companies active in fossil fuel sectors and exposure to controversial weapons such as cluster bombs. But after heavy lobbying from the fund industry, in February the European Supervisory Authorities reduced the number of so-called indicators asset managers have to report on, dropping issues such as deforestation. Maria van der Heide, head of EU policy at ShareAction, a responsible investment charity, says the concessions ""weaken the positive impact this legislation could have made"". Nevertheless, the new regulation is ""groundbreaking"", she says. ""It allows investors to compare between different products and how sustainable they are and see what asset managers are doing to integrate sustainability."" Molly Scott Cato, a professor of green economics at the University of Roehampton and a former Green party MEP, says the significance of the SFDR cannot be overstated. ""When people found there was horsemeat rather than beef in their lasagne in 2013 there was an outcry, but when the equivalent happens in the financial sector, as it has for years, customers don't even have the right to know. SFDR will have a big impact in changing this."" She adds: ""This long-overdue regulation will finally allow people who buy pensions and investments to know what their money is being used for and provide them with a better understanding of the impact of their investments on people and the planet."" Authorities are already warning asset managers not to exaggerate in their assessments, with some regulators, such as the Central Bank of Ireland, saying they will be keeping a close eye on how asset managers categorise their funds. Morgan Stanley, the US bank, recently warned that ""funds should consider the potential negative reputational impact of categorising funds as [sustainable] incorrectly"". Impact on companies Propelled by the new rules, PwC predicts that assets in sustainable investment products in Europe will jump more than threefold to reach €7.6tn by 2025. The number of ESG funds is expected to outnumber conventional funds, as asset managers rush to make their products greener to attract investors. PwC's Carré predicts this transformation of Europe's investment industry will have a dramatic effect on the companies in which fund managers invest, redirecting capital into sustainable activities and forcing businesses to be transparent about everything from their environmental impact to how they treat employees. ""If an asset manager wants to promote that [it invests based on specific sustainability] criteria, that will have impact on investments and that has an impact on capital flows and available financing for companies."" Mirza Baig, global head of ESG research and stewardship at Aviva Investors, the £355bn asset manager, also believes the growing sums of money managed in ESG funds will affect share prices. ""The consequences of companies being exposed for a lack of commitment or a lack of follow through [on ESG issues] will more likely result in a shift of capital and a more direct hit to their share price,"" he says. But as asset managers look to become greener, there are growing concerns that some investments are becoming overpriced. Last month, Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of energy company Total, warned there was a bubble in renewable energy assets. Generation's Nogales says there is a risk that some ESG asset prices are becoming inflated as the world's energy transformation gets under way. ""Industrial transitions are usually associated with bubbles and provided society can deal with that hangover, they are not bad,"" he says. But he adds: ""I am not saying there is a bubble in ESG."" Some fund managers also worry the new EU rules could have unintended consequences. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment at Royal London Asset Management, says the SFDR will result in much more transparency but warned of ""interesting challenges"". She argues that investors might be incentivised to punish companies even when they are making progress on ESG issues. For example, in order to report a low carbon footprint, a fund might avoid big energy businesses that have traditionally had high emissions, even if they were working to transform their operations and developing low-carbon technologies, she argues. Global spread Despite these concerns, the EU's new rules and the huge demand for sustainable investments in the region are being watched closely around the world. ""Europe is the centre of a lot of the regulator sustainability    drive, but they are not alone,"" says Jane Ambachtsheer, global head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management in France. In the US, the Trump administration pushed back against sustainable investing, including introducing rules to make it harder for some pension funds to consider ESG issues. But Joe Biden's arrival in the White House is expected to propel interest in ESG, particularly as the Democratic president has already unveiled a series of measures around climate change, including rejoining the Paris Agreement. ""We are in the middle of that [ESG] transition globally. The change in the administration in the US is going to provide addition tail wind,"" says Ambachtsheer. In the UK, the British government is facing calls to set out its own cuttingedge disclosure rules for funds in order to stamp out greenwashing. ""The UK disclosure regulations could recognise those who are really going the extra mile, rather than paying lip service,"" says UKSIF's Alexander. Even without other countries taking action, the impact of the EU's new rules will be felt across the world. This is partly because European open-ended funds known as Ucits are widely sold globally. At the same time, if a non-EU fund manager wants to market a fund to European investors, they will have to comply with the rules. Businesses from the US to India will also need to provide information to EU fund managers on issues from climate change to labour rights. ""There is certainly an extraterritorial reach with this,"" says Carré. For Europe's investment industry, the rising regulatory pressure and growing ESG demand from clients are driving a rapid transformation of the sector. Instead of standalone ESG teams or specialist stewardship teams, sustainable investing is being ""integrated"" into all investment decisions, says Sacha Sadan at Legal & General Investment Management, the UK's largest asset manager. ""Asset managers are bringing ESG right into the heart of investments."" In many cases, asset managers have little choice but to embrace ESG if they want to remain competitive: a report by Moody's in February predicted that ESG will be the main driver of the industry's organic growth in assets under management in 2021. DWS's Woehrmann says investing has changed for good, because people want to ensure their money is doing no harm. ""It is not only the outperformance [that is driving demand for ESG]. It is part of the zeitgeist"". As for Fondita's Björksten, he is hopeful the new EU rules will introduce much more rigour into the industry. ""The authorities have done a really great job in reducing greenwashing,"" he says. 'There was a view that ESG products would be a good weather product. But the resilience of these products is remarkable' 'This long-overdue regulation will finally allow people to know what their money is being used for' 94% Leading sustainable indices to beat their parent benchmarks in Q1 2020 <$1.7tn Assets in specialist sustainable mutual funds in 2020 a record level Europe leads the way in funds rebranding as ESG Number of funds by type Source: Morningstar 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 Active repurposed Passive Europe 2017 20 Asia 17 2017 20 US"
273117b6eb2711435e04,2021-03-11,ESG/BlackRock: virtuous circle,"Twitter: @FTLex The torrent of inflows into ESG-related funds continues. Europe so far leads the way. This week, the EU has introduced regulations to police the good intentions of fund managers such as BlackRock. So far, ESG indices show little evidence of outpacing plain vanilla peers. It may be the beginning of the end for asset managers who sell old funds in new green bottles. This week, a new EU regulation requires European fund groups to start backing up their claims of investing sustainably. BlackRock, the world's largest, wrote to European clients yesterday vowing to increase the proportion of investments that meet the EU guidelines. Good intentions are yielding good inflows. Sustainable investment is becoming a sustainable business. But for the moment it lacks public credibility. The EU plans to clamp down on ""greenwashing"" marketing claims with little environmental substance. So it should. Investment companies will presumably charge a premium for funds trading under the shingle of ESG (""environmental, social and governance"" standards). The EU will allow self-monitoring by investment groups this year. Next year, it will require funds to meet its own rules, which will be tougher for many. BlackRock, which has shifted its ESG stance from mysterious assenter to enthusiastic proponent, will lift the proportion of its funds committed to sustainable investing. Last year 62 per cent of its fund launches met EU guidelines on ESG principles. This year that proportion will be 70 per cent. But only 17 per cent of outstanding assets under management covered by the new requirement ($410bn of $2.5tn) met the target last year. The world's biggest asset manager wants to scoop up as much ESG inflows as possible. These have become a torrent. In the three years to end-2020, money coming in has grown at a quarterly compound rate of 18 per cent in Europe, according to Morningstar. The rate of increase is even faster in the US, though from a smaller base. Over 82 per cent of sustainable fund assets are Europebased according to Morningstar. Bogus claims abound in the world of ESG. Revealingly, the largest weighted constituents of MSCI's World ESG Leaders are very similar to those of its regular world equities index. It is time for the authorities to police the green claims of fund managers as tightly as their projections on investment returns."
a7de74d0461d58cd3948,2021-03-10,The growing army of amateur investors,"FT BIG READ. INVESTMENT Once dismissed as a quirky sideshow, the growth of retail trading on sleek, often fee-free smartphone apps such as Robinhood is transforming markets and forcing mainstream participants to take note. By Katie Martin and Robin Wigglesworth When newcomers discover Robinhood, and decide to use the zeitgeist US trading platform to punt around in stocks, many of them have questions. Chief among them, it seems, is ""what is the stock market?"". Along with ""what is the S&P 500?"", that is one of the most commonly visited educational pages on the broker's website, according to a new paper by academics at Oklahoma State and Emory universities. But what Robinhood's army of untrained investors lacks in market knowledge, it more than makes up for in enthusiasm and impact. A few months ago, these so-called retail traders were a quirky sideshow in US stocks, dabbling in markets to fend off the boredom of coronavirus lockdowns essentially fee-free, thanks to a price war kicked off by Robinhood in 2019. Under the online rallying cry that ""stocks only go up"", they demonstrated an optimism about the economic outlook that was often lacking among professional fund managers, pumping up some stocks that others would not touch. They ended up piggybacking on a historic rally in equities that has now been running for nearly a year. Few in the investment industry took this long-maligned ""dumb money"" seriously. Market veterans have pointed to the fizzing retail investment trend packed up in an online culture strewn with crass jokes and insults as a sign that markets are about to top out, and confidently predicted a cull of naive retail traders next time markets tumble. But a serious pullback has yet to land, and 2021 has proven to be a breakthrough year for the amateur traders. Credit Suisse estimates that at times this year they have accounted for a third of all US stock market trading. Having demonstrated an ability to move markets, retail traders are now a community of market participants that savvy investors want to understand and plug in to their own trading models. The flows are now large enough to count. ""The can of worms is open,"" says Eric Liu, head of research at Vanda Research, which has turned its attention to tracking the behaviour of amateur investors. ""If you break free of this belief that fundamentals matter to markets, then you look to this."" Hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, banks and other market professionals are poring over this kind of data, he says. The burning question on Wall Street is whether this burst of hyperactive retail trading is a temporary coronavirusinspired phenomenon that will inevitably ebb once markets next crash as happened after the dotcom boom and bust or the start of a new regime driving the US stock market. ""Powerful waves of passive and systematic investment long made retail investors largely irrelevant when framing market forecasts ... until now,"" says Alain Bokobza, head of global asset allocation at Société Générale. ""Rather than criticising retail investors and their behavioural patterns, it is better to slot them into the money equation."" GameStop moonshot The GameStop trading frenzy is the most explosive and visible example of a shift in market power that has been building in plain sight for more than a year. In January, shares in the video gaming retailer rocketed higher as amateur investors, sharing a wealth of ideas on social media sites such as Reddit, zeroed in    on the beaten-up stock and crushed hedge funds that had been shorting it in expectation that the seller of new and old video games was toast in the digital age. The 2,000 per cent rally in GameStop shares unravelled within days. But the potential for a rerun in favoured stocks is strong. Already, GameStop shares have made another shot at the moon. They are still up by more than 700 per cent so far this year. Many in the industry point out that the market-moving power of amateur traders is more than a fleeting fad focused on a narrow set of stocks. Vanda's Liu compares it to the transformative shift away from active money managers into passive investing that followed the 2008 financial crisis. ""We are on a moving train,"" he says. ""In the past year, we have yet to see a major thematic move that's not been sponsored by retail."" For other participants seeking to divine retail traders' next steps, Liu's analysis suggests that the amateurs are drawn ""from one hot theme to the next"". Last spring, for instance, they hopped on to the so-called ""reopening trade"", buying shares in airlines such as Delta and cruise ship operators such as Carnival in the expectation or hope that lockdown conditions would lift quickly. At times they accounted for a half or more of all trading in these stocks. Then they moved on to big technology stocks. Vanda says in some weeks last year, they accounted for as much as half of all trading in Apple the biggest beast of the US stock market. The next big push was electric vehicle stocks such as Tesla, and then sustainable investments as the US election drew closer, betting on the likelihood of a Biden administration in the White House. Finally, January brought the bullish assault on heavily-shorted names such as GameStop and cinema operator AMC, changing the game for short-sellers for ever. ""We think the GameStop event will drive net positions on equities longer as asset managers will now think more than twice before opening shorts,"" says Bokobza. ""They no longer have any choice but to take on board the specific behavioural patterns of a new breed of investor."" 'You only live once' The boom is a global phenomenon, with stock trading clubs, messaging groups, chat forums and even ""rooms"" on audio social networking site Clubhouse mushrooming across the world, from South Korea to Norway. But the US is the epicentre of the stock market earthquake. Larry Tabb, a veteran market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, estimates that ordinary retail investors have on average accounted for 23 per cent of all US equity trading in 2021, more than twice the level of 2019. That means their stock market footprint is roughly as big as all hedge funds and mutual funds combined, and trail only behind high-frequency traders in their hyperactivity. Their heft is being felt. Deutsche Bank believes the horde of new US retail investors has been ""a key driver behind the speed, duration and composition"" of the equity market rally that has been running since late March 2020. Robinhood is thought to have around 13m users now. Analysis firm Apptopia says the broker's app was downloaded 3.4m times just in January this year. But the incumbent brokerages are also still drawing in a crowd. The likes of Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers and E*Trade also added millions of new trading accounts last year. Fidelity alone added 3.7m in 2020, according to its annual report. The r/WallStreetBets forum on Reddit that led the GameStop charge now boasts 9.4m members or ""degenerates"", as they call themselves up fivefold since the start of the year, and more than 10 times since the start of 2020. A Deutsche Bank survey found that almost half of US retail investors were completely new to the markets in the past year. They are young, mostly under 34. And they are aggressive: much more willing than those more experienced in stock markets to borrow to fund their bets, to make heavy use of options to fire up wagers on stocks, and to use social media as a research tool to find trading ideas. Survey respondents told the bank they planned to put 37 per cent of any forthcoming stimulus cheques from the government into stocks. That could be as much as $170bn. In the event of a drop in stock markets, they do not intend to back out. They intend to put more money in. ""It has always been a contrarian indicator when you have large-scale retail investment,"" says Kasper Elmgreen, head of equities at Amundi, the French asset management group. ""We saw that in the late 1990s, when taxi drivers were talking about stocks. It's a warning sign. But the combination of retail investors and social media is a force to be reckoned with.""    Elmgreen believes that when vaccines have been pumped in to enough arms to facilitate a return to work and office life, some of this retail enthusiasm will fade away. Yet the Deutsche Bank survey suggests that may not be the case, with retail investors saying that they plan to maintain or add to stock holdings when the economy reopens. In this and other ways, it is clear that the new generation of retail investors is different. In the 1990s the last big moment for amateur speculation that ended with the dotcom boom and bust the mean retail investor was 50 years old and had around $47,000 to play with, the Oklahoma State and Emory paper notes. Now, he or she is younger, around 31, and has less to invest between $1,000 and $5,000, and the mindset is new. ""The motto of the Reddit crowd is YOLO. 'You only live once' is not a motto for saving for retirement,"" says Jordi Visser, chief investment officer at Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, a hedge fund. ""I don't think enough people take to heart what these words mean. This millennial crowd wants to invest in the long shots, not save."" Gambler's mindset Some of the investment industry's old guard think the current frenzy is abhorrent. Charlie Munger, the 97-year-old vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, recently described the GameStop episode as a ""frenzy"" led by a ""new bunch of gamblers"" who have ""the mindset of racetrack betters"". Robinhood responded that Munger's views were ""disappointing and elitist"". The response on r/WallStreetBets was more partisan. In one of the more printable comments, Reddit user ever_onward said: ""Mind your own business grumpy gramps."" It may still be the case that the end of pandemic lockdowns breaks the spell, or even that new regulation hits the brakes on commission-free trading. The latest drop in bond prices serves up the real possibility that retail traders' favourite bets could fall back to earth with a bump. Yet, many on Wall Street are beginning to believe that this retail boom is likely to prove more durable than previous episodes. They point to changes since the dotcom bubble that combined are likely to have far-reaching consequences beyond the pandemic: the emergence of free trading; the ability to trade fractions of shares; improved user interfaces and connection speeds; cheaper and easier access to leverage; and the growth of social media. Robinhood's breakthrough came thanks to its pioneering of commissionfree trading, but by the end of 2019 all its big establishment competitors had followed suit. At the same time, brokerages started letting investors trade fractions of shares, meaning that even $50 is enough to buy a slice of Amazon stock currently worth about $3,000. Retail investors can now easily trade on the bus, at home or over university lunch breaks on sleekly-designed smartphone apps, while the dotcom boom happened in the pre-broadband era and almost a decade before the birth of the iPhone. Access to leverage in the form of ""margin"" loans from brokerages or financial derivatives like options is also freer than ever before. US margin debt soared to a record $799bn in January. The power of social media brings all these factors to the boil. Whether it is Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, Twitter, WhatsApp messaging groups, live trading sessions streamed and discussed on sites like Discord or Twitch primarily used by video gamers social media is adding vim to the trend. While there were internet forums and newsletters in the 1990s, the current social media environment is radically more powerful, investors and analysts say. For many, there is no way to recork the retail trading genie, and the mainstream investment industry simply has to adapt. ""As you democratise trading and investing ... there's never a way back. You don't see commissions going up,"" says Liu at Vanda. He takes a sardonic view of retail investors' strategies, and their possible implications. ""I don't share this concern that markets are no longer trading on fundamentals. They have not traded on fundamentals for a long time.""

737c6015d3e2befafc71,2021-03-08,StanChart tiptoes through a moral minefield,"London-based lender struggles to reconcile its brand promise 'here for good' with fast-growing business in China In 2010 Standard Chartered adopted a new slogan: ""Here for good."" Now, just as Google before it with its ""Don't be evil"" mantra, the bank is finding it hard to reconcile its values with its business in China. Like its larger rival HSBC, StanChart is struggling to balance its commercial dependence on the country with its London headquarters and reliance on US dollars. The internal debate is sharpening amid rising geopolitical tensions and increased pressure from investors on environmental, social and governance issues. Led by chief executive Bill Winters, late last year StanChart's top executives met to discuss reputation risk. Separately, the board debated its approach to government relations. China and human rights featured prominently in both discussions, according to people familiar with the meetings. The non-executive director responsible for brand values and conduct Jasmine Whitbread, a former Oxfam director and ex-CEO of Save the Children chaired the meeting. Attendees questioned whether, by continuing to do business with Chinese state firms accused of human rights violations in Xinjiang, StanChart was living up to its brand promise of ""here for good"". Some board members expressed concern that the bank's relationships with such state entities exposed it to excessive reputational risk, the people said. They also discussed their approach to the national security law imposed on Hong Kong and US sanctions on some of the city's top officials. Greater China is StanChart's most important regional market, accounting for four-fifths of its 2020 profit. ""China is obviously a really big issue at the bank and there is significant tension between the fact we need China and a good relationship with its authorities, versus the brand promise 'here for good',"" said one person involved in the internal debates. ""If you have a business that is geared to China, how do you approach the Uighur muslims, US-China geopolitics, the belt-and-road colonialist debt trap and Hong Kong, while being a bank that espouses ESG values?"" the person added. ""How do you make that fit? We have been spinning the wheels trying to work it out, without success."" StanChart's strategy for now remains to tread lightly and avoid provoking the Chinese government, several of the senior sources said. However, the bank is increasingly being forced to pick sides. Last June, with protests still raging on the streets of Hong Kong, the lender crafted a statement intended to appear neutral. ""We believe the national security law can help maintain the longterm economic and social stability of Hong Kong"", it said, adding that the ""one country, two systems"" principle should be maintained. Many staff were upset and internally it was interpreted as implicit support of China, several sources said. British lawmakers and some institutional investors publicly criticised the stance. ""Hong Kong and mainland China are fundamental to our business ... and we remain committed to these markets,"" the bank said. ""We comply with all relevant laws and regulations, and seek to engage constructively and be a    force for good wherever possible."" Another episode when the bank was torn between commercial considerations and its values was the assassination of Saudi dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, in October 2018, two of the people said. At the time, StanChart was applying for a banking licence in Saudi Arabia, which led to a debate over whether it should continue. It did and was granted a licence in February 2019. Worrying over the clash between the west and China and potential blowback for StanChart also contributed to a recent decision to sever business with international embassies. Late last year, a review by the Londonbased bank found that many embassies including those of China, the UK and US, and some emerging-market countries generated little income while flouting strict compliance and antimoney laundering rules, leaving it exposed to regulatory action, according to five people with knowledge of the decision. But executives were concerned that they risked severe repercussions for cutting off individual nations. They were especially anxious about relations with its profit engine, China, and the UK, where it is headquartered and regulated. Ultimately, it decided the least contentious decision would be to close all embassy accounts, the people said. StanChart which traces its roots to a royal charter from Queen Victoria 168 years ago is one of the world's last truly global lenders, operating a network across 60 countries with 85,000 employees. The embassy cull is indicative of the challenges of running an international bank that straddles east and west during resurgent superpower tensions. It also reflects concerns about operating in an increasingly strict regulatory environment in which StanChart is one of the main intermediaries between China, Africa and the Middle East, and international capital markets. ""We are going to annoy a lot of our friends in countries where we banked their embassies, but the decision was taken across the board for this reason,"" one of the people involved said. ""We know embassies can create problems, so don't want to get caught up in that. This was a business decision, not a political one."" Nevertheless, African central banks including those of Kenya, Nigeria and Botswana have contacted StanChart to express concerns about their embassies being cut off, some of the people told the Financial Times. Bankers internally are fretting over the possible loss of sovereign wealth fund business as a result, they added. The embassy exits are part of ""transformation measures to improve efficiency and sharpen focus on activities that buttress our resilience and productivity,"" a spokesman said. ""The bank remains fully committed to its broader government and country relationships."" StanChart's move is part of a trend that began a decade ago, when many international lenders, including JPMorgan, closed the accounts of foreign government officials because of the opacity of embassy and diplomatic money flows and their reticence to provide detailed information. A saving grace in StanChart's geopolitical dilemma has been HSBC'S higher profile and heavier footsteps. Its chief executive, Noel Quinn, has been summoned before the UK Parliament to justify its actions in Hong Kong and the lender was repeatedly singled out for freezing the accounts of pro-democracy activists by former US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Donald Trump losing power in the US may help ease tensions. Last month StanChart chief Winters said he hoped new President Joe Biden would re-engage with China and end ""tit for tat"" escalations in trade and geopolitics. Senior figures within the bank have also bridled at what they see as hypocritical criticism from lawmakers and investors. They argue it ignores the recent history of autocratic British colonialism in Hong Kong. It also overlooks other industries' close ties with authoritarian regimes in Asia and the Middle East, including asset management and the political establishment itself. ""We are just a microcosm of what is happening across the world,"" said one of the sources. ""It would be economic suicide for most companies and countries, including China, to get into a total stand off.

5e7358b0f54c430b6765,2021-03-06,Much of a Dutchness,"Amsterdam property | The city's quintessential aspects attract foreign buyers while the absence of visitors is a boon for locals. By Zoe Dare Hall anals, cobbles and wonky houses, plus a popular food market every Saturday. It's exactly how I imagined Amsterdam to be before I moved here,"" says Henry Hofman, 31, who relocated to the Dutch capital from London last June to work for the global ESG research and ratings provider Sustainalytics. Hofman rents a two-bedroom flat in a converted paint factory for €2,000 a month in the cool, arty Jordaan district, ""where lots of expats live, but also Dutch families, who sit outside their houses in summer having dinner in the sun"", he says. What no one could imagine, though, was a city of 800,000 used to seeing 20m foreign visitors a year now largely devoid of any visitors at all. Amsterdam is seen by many locals as one of the world's casualties of overtourism, leading to the council's ban on holiday lets in the city centre, the closure of some of its cannabis coffee shops and mooted plans to move the red-light district to the suburbs. Now, ""cycling around the city centre, it feels like the 1700s. It's so peaceful. C Local people are enjoying the lack of tourists, especially the low-quality tourists,"" says Jaap Russchen, managing director at buying agent Amsterdam House Hunting. While holidaymakers are light on the ground, foreign buyers are not, says Russchen, whose client-base is entirely expats about 30-40 per cent from the UK, the rest from all over the world. ""They work in finance, IT, small startups. They usually rent here for a year, then come to us with average budgets of €400,000-€1m when they want to buy,"" he says. Just over 8,000 people moved to Amsterdam last year a similar number to each of the previous four years, according to the World PopulaPROPERTIES tion Review. Its global employers, such as Netflix Amsterdam and Tommy Hilfiger, are major magnets for many young professionals. Amsterdam also overtook London as Europe's biggest share-trading centre in January: ""It's indicative that the city is becoming a major player, particularly in some specialised financial-services sectors,"" says Lisette van Doorn, chief executive of Urban Land Institute Europe, a research organisation. In 2019, the Netherlands ranked as the best country in the world for work-life balance, according to the OECD's Better Life Index, taking into account factors such as availability of childcare, sense of community and working hours. ""Working from home was already common here for 35 per cent of the population before the pandemic,"" says van Doorn. According to Russchen, most foreign buyers, particularly families, gravitate towards the homes near schools and parks in the half circle that skirts the central canal district, from Westerpark east to the Amstel river. The wealthiest area is south of Vondelpark, where €1mplus will buy a duplex apartment of about 100 sq m. Elsewhere in this desirable semi-circle, a 90 sq m apartment with a garden is on sale for €685,000. ""It will sell for about €750,000. There are always 30 or 40 buyers after every property, so they tend to go for 10-20 per cent over asking price,"" says Russchen. Land Registry figures show that more than two-thirds of homes in Amsterdam sold for above asking price in the year to January 2021. Some overseas buyers are committing virtually. Leslie de Ruiter, managing partner at Christie's International Real Estate (CIRE), recently made three sales based purely on videos to buyers in London, Hong Kong and Geneva. One was a canal house ""They're still highly desirable and sell for around €10,000 per sq m,"" says de Ruiter, who handled the city's highest price sale last year a 1,000 sq m house on Keizersgracht that went for €12.5m. But the lack of parking, schools and in normal times the constant stampede of tourists means many buyers prefer something more modern and less frenetic in areas such as Oud-Zuid (Old South), and the Museumkwartier, where properties cost up to €20,000 per sq m. ""We're getting close to €30,000 per sq m for some exceptional transactions,"" says de Ruiter, mentioning    Amsterdam's most expensive penthouse, a three-bedroom residence in Dam3, next to the high-end department store De Bijenkorf, priced at €11m. High demand for housing, even during lockdown, and Amsterdam's chronic undersupply means the average house price in Amsterdam last year was 4.7 per cent higher than in 2019, according to Statistics Netherlands and Kadaster, the Dutch Land Registry. Across the country, the average property price in January was 9.3 per cent higher than in January 2020 the largest price increase for more than two years. Last July, the city brought in new restrictions to limit the number of homes used as short-term and holiday rentals, with officials claiming that one in 15 homes was offered for online rental on sites such as Airbnb. New rules ban short-term rentals in three areas that make up the city's central old town, and limit holiday rentals in other areas to a maximum of 30 days a year and to groups of no more than four people. In a further attempt to make the city's housing more affordable, Amsterdam has ruled that all new-build homes on city land will only be available to owneroccupiers, and not landlords. ""About 20 per cent of our new-build buyers used to be for buy-to-let, so now that's gone it means these units take longer to sell,"" says de Ruiter. ""But there is still enough demand among people who want to live here."" Rental prices are now falling across the country for the first time in six years, according to the online platform Pararius. The drops are biggest in cities, it says, mostly because the pandemic caused many expats to head back to their home countries. In the third quar(Above) ter of 2020, the average rent in Amsterdam was down 5.9 per cent year-onyear. According to real estate services and investment company CBRE, prime rents for apartments in Amsterdam fell by 3.3 per cent in the year leading up to the fourth quarter of 2020. A new departure for the private rental market, though, is properties that are being promoted as ""Covid-proof"", with features such as touch-free lifts and HEPA air filters. One example is Sluishuis in Ijburg (also known as the IJ), an inverted V-shaped building that forms the centrepiece of a new residential neighbourhood in North Amsterdam built on artificial islands, with apartments from €355,000 through CIRE. For many Dutch buyers and renters, the rejuvenation of Amsterdam's outlying docks holds the answer to the city centre's inflated prices. In north Amsterdam, ""an area known as NDSM is booming, with big developers such as Hines building large, mixed-use schemes,"" says Bas Wilberts, director of Savills Netherlands. ""And schemes such as OurDomain in south-east Amsterdam are offering a lot of good-quality starter homes and student housing in an area that was once seen as remote. ""We have a relatively young population, a lot of single-person households, who are becoming more footloose and happy to live in these newly developing areas,"" he says. For foreign relocators to the city like Hofman, however, nothing beats quintessential, old Amsterdam. Not that he has seen quite what that is like yet. ""It has been essentially tourist-free since I arrived,"" he says. ""It will be interesting to see how it changes when the world opens up."""
042b45dc5c3c89f2cb01,2021-03-05,Bubbles can also lead to golden ages of productive growth,"S ir Alastair Morton had a volcanic temper. I know this because a story I wrote in the early 1990s questioning whether Eurotunnel's shares were worth anything triggered an eruption from the company's then boss. Calls were made, voices raised, resignations demanded. Thankfully, I kept my job. Eurotunnel's equity was also soon crushed under a mountain of debt. Nevertheless, the company was refinanced and the project completed. I raised a glass to Morton's ferocious determination on a Eurostar train to Paris a decade later. With hindsight, Eurotunnel was a classic example of a productive bubble in miniature. Amid great euphoria about the wonders of sub-Channel travel, capital was sucked into financing a great enterprise of unknown worth. Sadly, Eurotunnel's earliest backers were not among its financial beneficiaries. But the infrastructure was built and, pandemics aside, it provides a wonderful service and makes a return. It was a lesson on how markets habitually guess the right direction of travel, even if they misjudge the speed and scale of value creation. That is worth thinking about as we worry whether our overinflated markets are about to burst. Will something productive emerge from this bubble? Or will it just be a question of apportioning losses? ""All productive bubbles generate a lot of waste. The question is what they leave behind,"" says Bill Janeway, the veteran investor. Fuelled by cheap money and fevered imaginations, funds have been pouring into exotic investments typical of a latestage bull market. Many commentators have drawn comparisons between the tech bubble of 2000 and the environmental, social and governance frenzy of today. Some $347bn flowed into ESG investment funds last year and a record $490bn of ESG bonds were issued. Last month, Nicolai Tangen, the head of Norway's $1.3tn sovereign wealth fund, said that investors had been right to back tech companies in the late 1990s even if valuations went too high just as they were right to back ESG stocks today. ""What is happening in the green shift is extremely important and real,"" he said. ""But to what extent stock prices reflect it correctly is another question."" If the past is any guide to the future, we can hope that this proves to be a productive bubble, whatever short-term financial carnage may ensue. In her book Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital, the economist Carlota Perez argues that financial excesses and productivity explosions are ""interrelated and interdependent"". In fact, past market bubbles were often the mechanisms by which unproven technologies were funded and diffused even if ""brilliant successes and innovations"" shared the stage with ""great manias and outrageous swindles"". In Perez's reckoning, this cycle has occurred five times in the past 250 years: during the Industrial Revolution beginning in the 1770s, the steam and railway revolution in the 1820s, the electricity revolution in the 1870s, the oil, car and mass production revolution in the 1900s and the information technology revolution in the 1970s. Each of these revolutions was accompanied by bursts of wild financial speculation and followed by a golden age of productivity increases: the Victorian boom in Britain, the Roaring Twenties in the US, les trente glorieuses in postwar France, for example.    When I spoke to Perez, she guessed we were about halfway through our latest technological revolution, moving from a phase of narrow installation of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, 3D printing and vertical farms to one of mass deployment. Whether we will subsequently enter a golden age of productivity, however, will depend on creating new institutions to manage this technological transformation and green transition, and pursuing the right economic policies. To achieve ""smart, green, fair and global"" economic growth, Perez argues the top priority should be to transform our taxation system, cutting the burden on labour and long-term investment returns, and further shifting it on to materials, transport and dirty energy. ""We need economic growth but we need to change the nature of economic growth,"" she says. ""We have to radically change relative cost structures to make it more expensive to do the wrong thing and cheaper to do the right thing."" Albeit with excessive enthusiasm, financial markets have bet on a greener future and begun funding the technologies needed to bring it to life. But, just as in previous technological revolutions, politicians must now play their part in shaping a productive result. john.thornhill@ft.com Whether we enter a glorious epoch will depend on how we manage the green transition"
818aa4815602eab701fc,2021-03-05,Tesla seals New Caledonia nickel supply deal,"Automobiles Tesla has agreed to buy nickel from a mine in New Caledonia in a move to secure its supply of the battery metal, which chief executive Elon Musk has called the group's ""biggest concern."" The carmaker will become a technical adviser at the Goro mine on the Pacific island and get long-term supplies from the project as part of a deal with the New Caledonia government, according to a person directly familiar with the matter. The move comes amid growing concerns about supplies of nickel following a 26 per cent rally over the past year and growing investment by Chinese companies in Indonesia. ""Nickel is our biggest concern for scaling lithium-ion cell production,"" Musk said on Twitter last month. New Caledonia is one of the largest nickel producers, but in December, protests by groups seeking independence from France delayed the sale of the lossmaking Goro mine and refinery by Brazilian miner Vale to a consortium called Prony Resources. The agreement with representatives of the independence movement will allow the sale to go through and give 51 per cent of the project to state entities based in the territory, according to a Reuters report. Commodity trader Trafigura will have a 19 per cent share, according to the Switzerland-based company. Vale said the deal would ""enable the operations to continue with a sustainable path for the future, preserving jobs and delivering economic value to the country."" While Tesla will not have an equity stake, its involvement in the mine signals efforts to gain greater control over its supply chain from mine to battery as it ramps up production. Last year Tesla agreed to buy cobalt from Swiss miner Glencore. Nickel, mined mostly in Russia, Can-ada, New Caledonia and Indonesia, is primarily used to make stainless steel. But growth in electric vehicles is adding a new source of demand. While Chinese companies have invested heavily in new nickel projects in Indonesia over the past few years, the process to extract and process the nickel uses energy from coal-fired power. ""The only incremental nickel tonnage is coming from Indonesia, but the problem with Indonesia from an ESG perspective is that it may not meet the criteria of Tesla,"" Jim Lennon, an analyst at Macquarie, said. ""Tesla is way behind in securing units and the Chinese have wrapped it up."" On Tuesday, Chinese stainless steel producer Tsingshan said that it had signed a deal to sell 100,000 tonnes of nickel to two Chinese battery materials groups, Huayou Cobalt and CNGR Advanced Material. It said it had been producing higher-purity nickel at its plant in Indonesia since last July."
4ea4bab4c0ec22b8ccf0,2021-03-03,Danone: half measures,"Twitter: @FTLex ""Wanted: new chief executive for Danone, French entreprise à mission. Pressing tasks at this purpose-driven yoghurt maker include achieving 3-5 per cent organic growth and executing predecessor's strategic overhaul. Warning: multiple constraints. Incumbent boss remains as chairman; vice-chairpersons and newly elevated lead independent board director are dyed-in-the-wool old school. Latitude further crimped by assets that have already been put on the block with proceeds earmarked."" Headhunters will have a tough job filling this one. Emmanuel Faber, under pressure from activist investors to step down, is relinquishing just half his job by standing down as chief executive but keeping the chairmanship. His record and the French food group's lacklustre performance have left activist shareholders baying for blood. Faber has presided over three cuts to profit forecasts since taking the helm in 2014. Like Paul Polman, former boss of Unilever, Faber has championed sustainability and broader ESG: hence last year's reframing of the yoghurt maker as an entreprise à mission, with social as well as financial objectives. Polman's efforts were widely lauded but sustainability targets do not always chime with financial ones. Accountability, sustainability and diversity are increasingly and rightly sought by big investors such as BlackRock but company chiefs can err on targets and incentives. Danone, for example, links 10 per cent of management's short-term incentive pay to a woolly sounding metric: ""employees sustainable engagement"". But this puts Danone in a small group of maybe 5-20 per cent of European companies linking incentive pay to ESG targets. Activist investor Cevian Capital is calling on European companies to follow suit, linking meaningful ESG targets into incentive plans. Expect more investors to be this demanding."
e5ae8d267e694b33f603,2021-03-03,Cevian warns boards to include ESG metrics in bosses' pay,"Financials Cevian Capital, Europe's largest activist investor, has warned it will punish companies that fail to set environmental, social and governance targets when deciding executive pay, in a move it believes will deter ""ESG box checking"". The intervention from Cevian, which oversees more than €10bn, comes as sustainable investing races up the agenda for asset managers, with the pandemic deepening interest from shareholders, policymakers and other stakeholders in issues from climate change to employee rights. The Swedish group said yesterday that it would use its vote at annual meetings to call out groups that did not include ESG metrics in executive pay packages by 2022. Cevian's plans to use its vote at annual meetings marks one of the toughest stances yet taken on executive pay and ESG. The mushrooming interest in ESG has prompted corporate chiefs to become increasingly vocal, including setting net zero targets for emissions. But Cevian warned that in many cases executives' interest in ESG was driven by box ticking and argued long-term ""laudable statements"" were not supported by shorter-term metrics. Christer Gardell, Cevian's managing partner and co-founder, said there needed to be a clear link between ESG efforts and management pay. Shareholders, management teams and board directors all look at executive pay ""to drive and direct performance"", Gardell said, but only a ""tiny share of companies meaningfully incorporate ESG targets into their incentive plans"". ""That makes no sense,"" he said. ""To get away from ESG box checking and ensure that ESG considerations are truly embedded in corporate strategies, we need to incentivise management teams to embrace them."" According to ISS ESG, the responsible investment arm of Institutional Shareholder Services, companies are starting to include ESG metrics in executive pay packages. Its research found that the number of companies globally that included environmental or social metrics when deciding executive pay awards doubled since 2018, with about a fifth of 6,500 businesses examined now considering these factors. According to ISS ESG, companies such as Microsoft included diversity as a metric for executive pay, while others such as BHP included climate change and energy usage. But Cevian said such metrics were often not tough enough. It called on companies to develop ESG targets and incentives over the next year that they consider most relevant for its businesses and stakeholders. It added that businesses should then consult with their shareholders, before putting it to a vote at next year's annual meeting. The activist, which is usually among the largest shareholders in the companies in which it invests, said it would vote against the re-election of directors or pay plans, as well as advancing investor motions on this issue, if businesses did not include ESG metrics in pay. 'To get away from ESG box checking, we need to incentivise management teams'"
a47bde0efbbe7c310103,2021-03-03,Orbia finds breaking up is hard to do after touting ESG ambition,"A t the start of this year, Mexican conglomerate Orbia was poised for a landmark divestment. The company, which makes almost all the famous soles for Doc Martens footwear and a quarter of the world's turntable records, planned to exit one of its core businesses: vinyls. The negotiations between Orbia and Apollo Global Management on a deal came close to completing part of the 68-year-old company's ambitious shift to focus less on legacy businesses and more on people and the planet. Under high-profile chief executive Daniel Martínez-Valle, a former government official and entrepreneur, the company had changed its name from the more solid Mexichem to the trendier Orbia and adopted a mission statement of ""to advance life around the world"". Vinyls and plastics had jarred with that ambition and Orbia's drive to focus less on chemicals and more on agriculture, water and infrastructure. But at the eleventh hour, the company baulked on the vinyls sale. The deal was off and Martínez-Valle left. Orbia's financial results released late last month showed why. Overall, its 2020 performance beat market expectations. But vinyls was the standout. Accounting for just over a third of group revenues, its operating income surged nearly 300 per cent in the fourth quarter, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation leapt 86 per cent. ""Today, the vinyls business is printing money,"" said one person with knowledge of the failed transaction, adding the sale ""would have left money on the table"". Orbia and Apollo declined to comment. Orbia's billionaire patriarch, 82-yearold Antonio del Valle, made his name in banking before president José López Portillo nationalised the sector in 1982. He switched into industry, building Mexichem within a quarter of a century into a major global chemicals and petrochemicals business. Analysts believe the shrewd businessman ultimately could not accept the price. Orbia had discovered that when it came to ditching a highly lucrative legacy business, breaking up is hard to do. 'Today, the is printing the Mexican sold, it 'would money on the Orbia's positioning of environmental, social and governance values at the core of its operations made it a trailblazer among Mexican corporates. So does the collapse of the vinyls business sale show that, when the rubber hits the road, ESG is the first thing to go? ""I don't think it is,"" said Graham Stock, emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, which is part of the Climate Action 100+ and other investor groups holding companies to account on ESG. ""But it's part of a suite of factors that companies take into account. The bottom line is the dominant factor everywhere."" Orbia has been through transformation before. It began life in 1953 as a steel cable company, but exited that business in 2005 a year after acquiring a producer of hydrofluoric acid used in Teflon, refrigerants and medications. It later expanded further into chemicals, PVC pipes, irrigation equipment and other industrial supplies. With Sameer Bharadwaj newly installed at the helm, Orbia says it has no intention of abandoning its focus on ESG his pay contains a ""strong component"" tied to delivering on these issues. But Bharadwaj, an Indian with a doctorate in chemical engineering, an MBA from Harvard Business School and a hobby as an astronomer, talked    more in the analysts call for the recent results about delivering sustained earnings and unlocking shareholder value than doing well by doing good. His focus, people familiar with his style say, is less flashy and more about delivering. That might reflect a need to boost a share price that remains stubbornly below its level in March 2018 when Mexichem kicked off its transformation. At that time, it was trading around 56 pesos; now it is at 49 pesos. Bharadwaj previously led Orbia's vinyls and fluorspar mineral divisions. He knows the vinyls business is cyclical. Things are booming now because a supply crunch has boosted PVC prices. Orbia is one of the world's top producers of speciality PVC. He was careful never to say never to a sale. But he told analysts the outlook was solid and there was more value to unlock for shareholders, adding ""we won't be in a rush, but we will explore joint ventures and other opportunities"". Orbia is not ditching its green goals but with a vinyls business that insiders say is doing ""insanely well"", business logic is proving hard to ignore. jude.webber@ft.com 'Today, the vinyls business is printing money' and if the Mexican group had sold, it 'would have left money on the table'"
a4e82470212a8b9e61ef,2021-03-01,What can we learn from those at the top?,"FT series: Leaders' Lessons Over the coming months a panel of diverse leaders from across the world will share their experiences of the pandemic T he post-pandemic workplace is going to be a very different place, and managers and leaders will have to navigate extraordinary, new and difficult situations. In such an uncertain climate, hearing others' experiences can be valuable, so the Financial Times is convening a panel of diverse global leaders from a range of organisations. They will share insights from their own leadership experiences during the pandemic and their plans for the great workplace reset to come. For this first instalment, we have asked them to tell us: What is the most significant error you made in the last year, and what is the most significant insight you can share? Our intention is that this series will build into a useful reference source for anyone in a leadership role in 2021 and beyond. Julian Richer Founder and CEO, Richer Sounds We as a business have made many errors since the UK went into its first lockdown last March. But I would like to put that into perspective by saying that I am proud of the fantastic team that I am honoured to lead, who have done so many things incredibly well in very difficult circumstances. We have a culture of admitting, indeed encouraging, the discussion of mistakes (especially mine) under the heading of improvement because we always feel that it is important. One of our biggest mistakes during the Covid-19 pandemic was forgetting to adapt our freepost system this is what we put on every receipt we issue to ask customers to write to me if they have a problem in order that I can help them. The problem during lockdown was that our freepost system was no longer operating because the offices were closed. We now have a direct email address linked to my office. Another big mistake included not having any senior back-up in our finance team. This meant that when our finance director had to take longterm sick leave very suddenly, we were scuppered for several very stressful weeks. There were many things we have learnt to do better during the pandemic. For instance, we have bought our own warehouse as we would much rather choose, care for and reward our own staff directly. We have also had a cost saving drive, questioning the way we do everything (my mantra here is: ""There is no normal""). We discovered that we were being overcharged hundreds of thousands of pounds a year in a shipping costs error (which we have now, thankfully, recouped), and that two trusted suppliers hadn't been paying us retrospective payments as promised. Another revelation has been that all those meetings weren't actually neces-sary and that working from home was very do-able for those who were able and wanted to. Ilham Kadri Chief executive, Solvay When I became chief executive of Solvay in March 2019, I made it a point to prioritise reaching out to key investors during my first week in the job, to signal to them that both their investment and their input are important to me and to Solvay.    I continue to value and build on those relationships, knowing that we are only as good as the quality of the information we seek from people who are independent and experienced enough to provide it honestly. What I did not do as quickly, and wish I had done at the same time, was to reach out to investors' stewardship teams and proxy voters as well. Solvay is an inherently long-term, responsibly managed company whose materials and compounds are at the core of our collective ability to protect our planet and its people. But I had not met a proxy voter in any of my prior jobs, so it took me some time to realise this was a missed opportunity, and I put in the work needed to establish these relationships. Stewardship teams are a natural constituency for Solvay, so I have been making up for lost time. Their input is full of ideas that inform our governance and our operations. Just as important to me individually: I find stewardship teams' commitment to integrating financial sustainability and responsible operations energising and an affirmation that the path we are taking to becoming an ESG leader is the right one. Jaelle Ang Founder and CEO, The Great Room The biggest error in 2020 was falsely thinking that the management of the pandemic was a finite game we had to win. When we were into the second month of lockdown, I thought I was solving [it] to have positive cash flow for the months to come. I spent evenings poring over spreadsheets, contracts and tactics, preparing for difficult conversations with stakeholders. Months on, it struck me that this [crisis] is a shape-shifting, forward and backward, infinite round of games. We may or may not know when the whistle blows. Focusing on cash flow is like focusing only on the scoreboard and not on each pass or each play. For a co-working company, which is a home to the largest corporates and most enterprising technology companies, while cash flow is important, it is also ""the scoreboard"" and not the biggest problem to solve. In my obsession with that, I missed the opportunity to recognise early that we should be busy designing for greater trust and deeper connection. Whether members trust us, our protocols, our integrity and the community they are part of, will determine if they want to continue to be part of The Great Room through the pandemic and beyond. Human connection is primal and instinctive. Designing for higher quality interactions and meaningful experiences, which lead to deeper connections, means candid conversations have a better chance of being fruitful. In the poignant words of Ernest Hemingway: ""The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them"". It's that simple and it's that hard. Leena Nair Chief human resources officer, Unilever As an advocate of life-long learning, I have found mistakes to be a critical part of life because I believe that every mistake will, eventually, provide a learning opportunity. When the Covid-19 crisis hit, I felt pressure as a senior leader to provide a constant sense of reassurance and support to our global Unilever team (something which I'm sure all leaders can relate to). In February 2020, I suspect a lot of us pinned hopes on this tough time being a sprint, and that it would be temporary, rather than a marathon. Looking back, what I've learnt is that being optimistic and reassuring alone wasn't quite enough. Instead, with hindsight, I would have liked to shift gears more quickly to a grittier sense of optimism, working to balance reassurance with realism earlier on. I think we needed this sense of realism to help to remove some of the uncertainty that people faced, by planning for a more extended period of disruption. One of my lasting insights from the past 12 months is that while we are all in the same storm, we are not all in the same boat. It might feel like we're in the same crisis, but the realities and demands of this crisis are so very different for each individual. In our Unilever team, for everyone facing home schooling, it's one set of needs, which is different to the needs of those who are caring for vulnerable people and perhaps have been shielding for months and months to keep everyone safe. It's different for those who are in a crowded house share and perhaps working from their bedroom, to those who have been kept apart from family and loved ones as travel is very difficult.    In a crisis, where time is of the essence, it might be easy to focus on one-size-fits-all solutions but we have to keep reminding ourselves that everyone has different needs. Everything we create to look after our people has to be nuanced, adaptable and customisable. Nigel Vaz Chief executive, Publicis Sapient As the leader of a digital business transformation company, my orientation has always been that many companies, across many industries and geographies, would move in the direction of remote working. Last spring, the scale and pace at which the Covid pandemic swept aside any last vestiges of doubt regarding the possibilities of remote working was fascinating but no more than that. What I failed to anticipate was the epochal reimagining that it has brought about. It's not only employees and companies that are thinking differently about how, when and where work is done. So too are countries, their governments and tax authorities considering how to entice remote workers now that the physical bonds between worker and workplace have been broken. My learning has been not to consider office-based or homeworking as an either-or, but as a spectrum that is all about context and choices. The insight has been that our people work within different modes, which determine different needs on the spectrum of engagement. Some modes will require a faceto-face conversation whereas other interactions can be as simple as a text. The need will be for leaders to create an environment that accommodates all those modes which provides for as many choices as the context requires. While there are patterns in how people prefer to work based on personality type or life stage for example, we've observed younger people eager to get back to the office, while many parents enjoy the flexibility of remote working an operational plan based solely on archetypes is unhelpful. Instead, plan for people's different work modes. Understanding how your people's working modes change, within the same working week or even working day, will have profound implications on many aspects of how you organise your business. It will influence everything from how you design your physical spaces around a flexible workforce to how you design your culture. It will impact productivity and employee wellbeing; diversity, equity and inclusion programmes; where we recruit talent geographically, and when and where we travel to serve clients.

cfc27d386cc23d890021,2021-02-27,Greening your pension,"Compared with a few years ago, savers are now offered a growing range of sustainable funds, but making the right choice is difficult, writes Josephine Cumbo From recycling our rubbish or going vegan, to using the car less often, many of us are making small changes to our daily lives to reduce harm to the planet. But choosing to go green on our pension investments could have a far greater impact, as institutions managing our money may include investors in fossil fuels and those seeking environment-friendly alternatives. ""Our research indicates that moving a £100,000 pension pot with a traditional portfolio with oil and gas companies to a positive impact portfolio is the equivalent of taking five or six cars off the road a year,"" says David Macdonald, founder of The Path, a firm of advisers that specialises in positive impact investing. ""It is significant. People are waking up to the fact they can make a monumental difference by changing their investment strategy so it is well tuned to the planet,"" he says. The growth of funds invested along ESG principles environmental, social or governance has been rapid in recent years. Global ESG-linked funds took in nearly $350bn last year, compared with $165bn in 2019, according to data from Morningstar. Net assets in UK-domiciled ESG funds went from £29bn at the beginning of 2017 to £71bn by the end of 2020, including active and passive funds. Driving this trend is the wider choice for investors wanting to align their money with their values and profit from the good returns recently earned by ESG funds. ""Ten years ago, if you were interested in investing [according to one's values], your only real choice was to screen out the 'sin stocks' like alcohol, tobacco and weapons,"" says Jeannie Boyle, executive director at EQ Investors, a management firm specialising in positive impact investing. ""But the thinking has shifted to how can we allocate our capital towards companies making positive changes for society and the environment."" There is a greater choice of funds but making the right decision can be challenging: there is little standardisation in the way funds are described. FT Money outlines how to make your pension investments sustainable and be alert to greenwashing. Getting started A good place to get started is to get to grips with the investment jargon, which can be baffling. ""Responsible investment"" is a catch-all term, used by asset managers, broadly to describe funds which invest to make a positive change, to the environment or for society. Within this umbrella term are four broad investment approaches: ethical exclusion; responsible practice; sustainable solutions; and impact funds. ""Traditionally, it was thought that money and morals don't mix, but in recent years the whole fund management industry has come to recognise that not taking account of social and environmental factors can end up costing you money,"" says John Fleetwood, founder of Square Mile Consulting and Research.    ""There are different ways of approaching this, with a whole spectrum of investments. These are not mutually exclusive, but it's helpful to identify which approach best resonates with you."" Before you take the plunge and start picking stocks or funds, experts say it is important to cover the investing basics such as assessing your appetite for risk and setting clear goals about what you will or won't tolerate in your portfolio. ""I have worked with investors who are so motivated by helping the environment that they wanted to invest their whole fund in renewable energy or save the oceans, for example,"" says Boyle. ""But the portfolio has to have diversification. This is basic."" Macdonald of The Path says investors should be clear about their investment moral red lines, such as fossil fuels or fashion companies. ""Until you are clear on where your own boundaries are you may end up with a product that is incompatible with your views, as some funds have fuzzy, or unclear, investing boundaries."" Picking the right investment Once you've worked out your priorities, you can start to consider fund choices. As of August 2020, there were about 300 sustainable and responsible funds available to retail investors in the UK, from actively managed to passive index trackers. ""Responsible investment has evolved from being a niche consideration with relatively few options to encompassing a full spectrum of strategies with outcomes to meet all investment objectives, from income to capital growth and everything in between,"" says Fleetwood. Funds are available in the UK which offer exposure to nearly all asset classes, from mainstream equities and bonds to alternatives such as infrastructure, as well as to differing world regions and themes such as renewable energy or water and waste management, he adds. The most popular funds have billions of pounds under management and are offered by household namecompanies such as Vanguard andBaillie Gifford. Square Mile hasanalysed the market for sustainableand responsible investments to identify the funds with the largest assetsunder management (see table, far right). The growth of ethicaland sustainable investing has sparked a debate over whether investors sacrificereturns. when choosing these funds.However, research by Morningstar, inJuly 2020, examined the performance of 745 Europe-based sustainable funds and found most had performedbetter than non-ESG funds over one,three, five and 10 years. Fleetwood says there is growingevidence that funds that apply a""responsible"" filter ""have providedreturns superior both to their benchmark and to their more traditionalpeers"". Assess your portfolio Look at your employer's pension plan to check what it is invested in. ""Most workplace pensions willoffer some sort of ethical or sustainable fund outside the main defaultfund but there isn't a vast array ofchoice,"" says Boyle. ""These funds will charge more than the main defaultfund and may not fully align with what you are trying to achieve."" The UK's largest pension providershave committed by 2050 to be ""netzero"" or neutral on carbon emissionsfrom their main pension portfolios, apace seen as too slow by many climatecampaigners. But their initial moves in this direction are already apparent. ClaireWalsh, a chartered financial plannerand specialist adviser in ethicalinvestment, says that Aviva, a bigpension provider, has embedded ESGprinciples across its default funds andcombines the risk managementA pproach of lifestyling reducinginvestment risk as the end of the pension term nears with a responsible investment approach. She adds that Nest, another workplace pension scheme, has divested from tobacco and considers climaterelated financial risks within its investment process for its default funds. ""Both providers also have very good ethical funds,"" she says. Royal London has a long history of using its shareholdings to influence good corporate behaviour, she says. But innovation is also taking place outside the big providers. Cushon, a fintech company which describes itself as a ""disrupter"", this year launched a ""net-zero"" pension. However, this is only available if your employer chooses Cushon for your workplace scheme.    Legal & General offers a fossil fuelfree pension fund, in large part as a result of consumer demand. DIY portfolio options Savers who don't want to wait for their workplace pension to offer more responsible options could open a personal pension, or a self-invested personal pension (Sipp), to craft their own ethical portfolio. Most large insurers and asset managers, and new pension consolidators, now offer ethical investment options, or have a pre-screened list of ethical funds, to spare customers the legwork of doing their own research. Interactive Investor, the investment broker, produces the ACE40, a rated list of ethical collective investment vehicles. Becky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, says renewable energy and environmental stocks and funds have proved popular with clients. ""Many pension holders just don't want fossil fuels in their portfolio at all,"" she says. Holly Mackay, founder of Boring Money, a consumer finance website, said such shortlists were useful for pension savers who are happy to pick their funds and investments. Charles Stanley Direct, the investment broker, also lists its eight preferred sustainable funds, she adds, while AJ Bell Youinvest is the first platform to build its own one-stop shop the Responsible Growth Fund which people can hold in a pension for a total annual fee of 1.25 per cent. For those building their pensions and looking for a simple path to ticking the green box, Mackay believes Nutmeg and PensionBee have good current offers in the market. ""Nutmeg has quite detailed information on how it screens and builds its socially responsible portfolios. And PensionBee offers a fossil-free option in its pensions,"" she says. Typical fees for passive ethical and sustainable funds can range from 0.15 to 0.25 per cent a year and 0.75 to 1.15 per cent for actively managed funds. However, investors can expect to pay a slight premium for being morally minded, due to the extra levels of due diligence involved. ""As an example, the L&G UK Index Fund is available for a 0.1 per cent charge, however if you choose the Legal & General Future World ESG UK Index the annual charge is 0.15 per cent,"" says Nathan Long, senior analyst at investment broker Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Both funds give exposure to the UK stock market, but the ESG version comes at a premium. The increased cost is, of course, small and could easily be dwarfed by a difference in investment performance."" Identifying the greenwash Experts warn that those dipping into the market without the help of a professional financial adviser face a plethora of jargon. ""There is no common standard in how funds are described,"" says Dean McSloy, partner at The Private Office, a firm of chartered independent financial advisers. ""There are funds that badge themselves as ESG or 'sustainable' and 'responsible' but there is no easy way to establish how ESG or ethical those funds are. You'd really have to dig underneath and look at the all the holdings,"" he says. An added challenge is that regulations do not require UK asset managers to disclose all their holdings, so customers may not realise if they are breaking their investment principles. Boyle of EQ Investors says the universe of ethical funds has expanded significantly over the past two years, but some strategies had simply been repackaged to highlight their ESG credentials. ""Anyone looking to invest in passive funds needs to understand the index they are tracking,"" she said. Experts predict that money will continue to pour into ESG funds as investors look to align their values with their finances. ""We know from our own research that pension holders want their pensions to build a healthy planet as well as providing healthy returns,"" says Richard Curtis, the film director and co-founder of Make My Money Matter, a campaign group. ""The public has this huge weapon in their armoury when fighting for the planet. Now is the time to use it.""    Cutting through the fund jargon ESG investing environmental,social and governance covers awide range of ethical priorities.Square Mile Consulting, a fundresearch firm, breaks down themarket into five main areas. Ethical exclusion: Avoids industries and company practices that harm people or the planet. Be aware criteria vary, so check that they meet your needs. Responsible practices: Considers companies' operational practices and supports ""best practice"". Be aware you may be exposed to controversial industries, since the objective is to encourage improvements within companies. Sustainable solutions: Seeks to invest in companies providing solutions. to social and environmental challenges. Be aware sustainable funds invest in specific sectors and their performance will deviate from a benchmark index. Impact investing: Aims to invest to make a wider positive social or environmental impact as well as meeting financial need. Be aware some impact funds are highly focused on specific sectors, potentially increasing their volatility. Climate focused: These funds embrace both climate-aware investment and climate solutions. Be aware funds may invest in transitioning fossil fuel providers.
